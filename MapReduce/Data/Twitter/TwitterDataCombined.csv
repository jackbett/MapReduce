Think entertainment in general will be resilient in recession."
"@RichBTIG @ballmatthew @pcampisi14 @JenAshleyWright I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and guess that you are assuming as subs go down sports networks carriage price per sub goes flat to down as well.

Right now every sports network is a bargain compared to their value."
"@RichBTIG Agreed. If that was the case than Live TV would be gone by now based on what people say they do...yet here it is...still penetrated in 90M+ homes. With Live Sports more important than it ever has been (and locked into the Live TV ecosystem for years and years)."
