"@tcrean14 @RadioFreeTom I agree with you. but if you look this from an economics perspective with a constrained optimization approach...each person would glean greater utility from different combos of sports and academics and on an aggregate level that would mean that society should seek a balance."
"@tcrean14 @RadioFreeTom basically, gun to your head, you prioritize academics, but there is no gun to our head. id say that sports have tremendous societal value if they're operated correctly. I do not believe that making kids study/play music all day is a good model for improving society."
"@RadioFreeTom I don’t know that it’s a binary choice, though. I think the problem is that people don’t think they can be both superb athletes AND superb students...don’t know why that’s the case. But balancing sports &amp; books should create a race to the top and incentivize time management."
"@peggysadams @RadioFreeTom I 100% agree. I’ll add, just for the sake of argument, that violinists and football players are often at odds socially...I’d love to see students who love music be able to talk sports, and vice versa."
"@RadioFreeTom I’d also make the argument that sports (team sports) have inherent value as part of civil society — a culture which is fast dying and contributes to our political division."

"@ballmatthew @pcampisi14 @RichBTIG @JenAshleyWright Live TV subscribers went up between 2007 &amp; 2009. Box Office was flat to up. 

Would suggest that most Live TV and SVOD services are relatively cheap. Live sports, news &amp; visual entertainment might be just fine in a recession."
"@RichBTIG @EntStrategyGuy @nypost Ehhh, not all viewing hours created equal. A sports viewing hour is going to be far more valuable to a good amount of consumers vs any other viewing hour."
"@RichBTIG @ballmatthew @pcampisi14 @JenAshleyWright Not something you can answer and not something Disney/ESPN is going to need to answer for a good long time.

What matters right now is that sports network companies (Dis, Fox, etc...) will further eat into carriage fee share from the Viacom, Discovery, AMC and A&amp;Es of the world."
"@ballmatthew @pcampisi14 @RichBTIG @JenAshleyWright Not saying it wouldn’t. Just saying don’t be surprised if Live TV remains resilient in a recession due to it still being a good financial deal for the majority of Americans that need access to live sports and news.

Think entertainment in general will be resilient in recession."
"@RichBTIG @ballmatthew @pcampisi14 @JenAshleyWright I’m gonna go ahead and guess that you are assuming as subs go down sports networks carriage price per sub goes flat to down as well.

Me thinks that’s not going to be the case at all. Completely the opposite. 

Right now every sports network is a bargain compared to their value."
"@RichBTIG Agreed. If that was the case than Live TV would be gone by now based on what people say they do...yet here it is...still penetrated in 90M+ homes. With Live Sports more important than it ever has been (and locked into the Live TV ecosystem for years and years)."
