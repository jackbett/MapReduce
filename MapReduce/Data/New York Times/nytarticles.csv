"U.S.A. Basketball plans to gauge the interest of the Duke University sensation Zion Williamson in joining the Americans’ 12-man squad for the FIBA World Cup in China this summer, according to a person familiar with U.S.A. Basketball’s intentions.No discussions have taken place with Williamson, whose freshman season at Duke ended Sunday with a 68-67 quarterfinal loss against Michigan State in the N.C.A.A. tournament.Formal talks with Williams, the presumptive No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick, would most likely not take place until Williams had officially declared his intention to turn professional and chosen an agent licensed by the N.B.A. to represent him, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly.But the precedent for such an invitation was set by the current U.S.A. Basketball hierarchy in 2012, when Anthony Davis — fresh off being drafted No. 1 overall out of Kentucky by the New Orleans Pelicans — earned a roster spot with Team USA at the London Olympics under Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski.The 2019 World Cup, which runs Aug. 31 to Sept. 15 in China, will be the first major competition for the United States since Krzyzewski was succeeded as coach by Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. Williamson is widely regarded as the rare sort of talent, like Davis before him, who would not be out of place with the N.B.A. All-Stars expected to fill out Popovich’s roster — no matter who is coaching.The Athletic reported Monday that the Lakers’ LeBron James, a three-time Olympian, would not make himself available for the World Cup team this summer but that he had not ruled out playing for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.There was some hope in international basketball circles that James would consider playing in the World Cup since the Lakers had missed the playoffs and James would sit out the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since 2004-05.Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of U.S.A. Basketball, declined to discuss James or Williamson specifically when he was reached on Monday, saying only that roster invitations “will be addressed at the appropriate time.”"
"MILAN — As the National Basketball Association plods its way to the 68th annual All-Star Game in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday, American hoops fans should take note of how the Italians generate hardwood drama in February.Since Thursday, the eight best teams in Italy’s Lega Basket Serie A from the first half of the season have been competing for the Coppa Italia, a no-holds-barred, single elimination tournament whose outcome actually matters to fans, players, team owners and corporate sponsors. And while a champion will be crowned at the end of the playoffs later this spring, bragging rights for holding the Coppa’s trophy aloft on Sunday provides a midseason shot of adrenaline.The N.B.A.’s 82-game regular season, which began in October and will end in April, is a slog. Anyone who has watched a Wednesday night non-marquee matchup in November can attest to that. The action rarely begins before the fourth quarter; coaches rest their superstars.The first half of the Italian season, by contrast, is an exciting sprint from the opening tipoff. The 16-team league has a 30-game regular season in which each club plays each other twice — once at each other’s home court. If you play in Venice in week one, Venice’s team comes to your arena in week 16. And there’s drama: Turin, seeded fifth in last year’s Coppa, won the trophy, even though they placed 11th at the end of the season.There’s an intensity to the Italian regular season that too often is missing from the N.B.A.’s long fall and winter games. Not only are there fewer games, but also they are shorter and quicker (10- as opposed to 12-minute quarters and with fewer play stoppages mandated by television). And even if the quality of play in Italy is inferior, the interest in the February Coppa Italia far outstrips whether Team LeBron will prevail over Team Giannis at the N.B.A.’s All-Star Game.“Whether it is game six or 26, you are always playing for something,” said Travis Diener, an American who also holds Italian citizenship and plays on this year’s fourth-seeded team from Cremona. “Then you get the Coppa and anything can happen.” Diener, who spent several years in the N.B.A., won the M.V.P. award of the Coppa Italia when he was playing for Sassari in Sardinia in 2014.The Coppa allows teams from smaller markets (and smaller budgets) like Sassari and Cremona (more famous for Stradivarius violins than hoops) to pull off March Madness-like upsets against more glamorous squads like Milan, which is sponsored by Giorgio Armani and takes full advantage of the lack of a league salary cap.In last year’s Coppa, Milan was one of three top seeds that lost in the first round, much to the delight of fans from smaller-market teams like Cantù, which plays in the Milanese suburb of Desio. As one team official told me, it doesn’t hurt that coaches have built-in salary incentives if their team does well at the midseason tournament — and sponsors, of course, love the positive brand attention of a winning squad.The quarterfinal round began on Thursday and Friday, featuring a doubleheader each day: Milan-Bologna and Cremona-Varese on day one, and Venice-Sassari and Avellino-Brindisi on day two. American fans should try to imagine a similar midseason weekend tournament: What if the Bucks, Warriors, Raptors, Nuggets, Celtics, Pacers, Thunder and 76ers were playing in Charlotte this weekend for bragging rights to an American Basketball Cup? It would be a fresh take on a tired All-Star Game whose television ratings have declined by more than 50 percent since the Michael Jordan-dominated 1990s.The Italian basketball league used to have its own all-star game, but there wasn’t enough sustained interest from players or fans, so it ended in 2016. A dunk contest was similarly discontinued. Giorgio Gandolfi, a former basketball journalist who now runs his own international sports agency and who has been to 13 N.B.A. All-Star Games, said that winning the Coppa Italia is second in prestige only to winning the league championship at the end of the season. He doesn’t miss Italy’s all-star games. “They were just kind of boring,” he said.While there is too much money to be made for the N.B.A. — and team owners — to consider shortening the season from the grueling 82-game march to the playoffs, the idea of borrowing from the Italians to make each tipoff count more should be enticing.Take the case of the New York Knicks, who currently hold the worst record in the N.B.A. There is nothing much left for the Knicks to play for or their fans to watch this season.By contrast, Italian basketball teams near the bottom of the league run the risk of relegation to the second division, which is a bad result for everyone. That’s why the fight near the end of the season can be just as fierce at the bottom as it is as the top.If the Knicks had to worry about being consigned to the minor leagues, the folks at Madison Square Garden might think differently about how to handle the final months of the season. If the Knicks were demoted to play against the Maine Red Claws, New York fans would probably have some choice words and creative hand gestures for their team’s poor management. Italian basketball fans would have some advice on how to do that better, too."
"North Carolina has put its women's basketball coaching staff on paid administrative leave amid an investigation into ""issues raised by student-athletes and others,"" the school announced Monday in a news release.Those suspended are head coach Sylvia Hatchell, who just concluded her 33rd season leading the Tar Heels, and her three assistant coaches, per The News & Observer of Raleigh, N.C.The university did not specify the ""issues,"" but said a Charlotte, N.C., law firm ""will conduct the review and assess the culture of the women's basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.""Hatchell has been the head coach at UNC since 1986 and has led the Tar Heels to three NCAA Final Four appearances -- 1994, 2006 and 2007 -- and the NCAA championship in 1994.The program has made 23 appearances in the NCAA Tournament during her tenure. On March 23, the Tar Heels were eliminated by California in the first round of this year's tournament, 92-72.Hatchell, 67, has a 751-325 record in 33 seasons at North Carolina. She missed one season -- 2013-14 -- as she battled leukemia. She spent the first 11 seasons of her career at Francis Marion College in South Carolina, finishing 272-80.A 2013 enshrinee into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, she is the winningest women's basketball coach in Atlantic Coast Conference history.Hatchell also is one of three active coaches in NCAA women's basketball with 1,000 wins -- Stanford's Trish VanDerveer and Connecticut's Geno Auriemma are the others -- and the only women's college basketball coach to win national championships at three levels: AIAW, NAIA and NCAA.Hatchell issued a statement Monday afternoon via her attorney:""I've had the privilege of coaching more than 200 young women during my 44 years in basketball,"" her statement read. ""My goal has always been to help them become the very best people they can be, on the basketball court and in life.""I love each and every one of the players I've coached and would do anything to encourage and support them. They are like family to me. I love them all.""Of course, I will cooperate fully in this review. I look forward to a prompt conclusion of this matter and the continuation of our very successful women's basketball program.""In recent years, Hatchell's program has been plagued by transfers and the specter of the long NCAA investigation into potential academic fraud across a number of sports at North Carolina. The NCAA issued its findings in October 2017 with no penalties assessed.Hatchell's assistants are associate head coach Andrew Calder, who has been on the staff for 33 years and took over in 2013-14 when Hatchell underwent medical treatment; assistant coach Sylvia Crawley, a former North Carolina player; and Bett Shelby, the recruiting coordinator.--Field Level Media"
"OAKLAND, Calif. — The Golden State Warriors run a practice drill that Coach Steve Kerr did not intend as a tribute, even if he named it after someone who taught him a great deal. He calls it the “Lute Olson drill,” and it is a blur of activity: a 3-on-2 exercise that Kerr uses to get his players up and down the court.“It’s a good way to get a little running and rhythm and shooting,” he said.The Warriors, who are pretty good at those things, have elevated basketball into modern art in recent seasons. But Kerr, as he helps define basketball’s present, cannot help but dip into his past. He learned that drill in 1983, when he was a freshman guard at the University of Arizona playing for Olson, who was in the early stages of building a college powerhouse. Kerr, ever the student, was already absorbing as much as he could.Olson, 84, retired as the men’s basketball coach at Arizona in 2008, but his influence resonates. Not so much, oddly enough, at the college level, where, of late, Arizona has had its well-publicized struggles along with the rest of the Pac-12 Conference. Instead, Olson’s impact exists largely in the N.B.A. — and with the Warriors, in particular.Bruce Fraser, one of Kerr’s longtime assistants, played for Olson in the 1980s before working under him as a graduate assistant. And Andre Iguodala, the veteran Warriors forward, played at Arizona from 2002 to 2004, when he sought to emulate an older teammate named Luke Walton.“All the fundamentals,” Iguodala said. “Things like footwork, body positioning and just being a smart player.”Walton, who now has the thankless task of coaching the Los Angeles Lakers, is still considered a member of the Warriors’ extended family after serving as one of Kerr’s assistants for two seasons. Before Walton joined the Warriors in 2014, Kerr did not know him well. But Olson recommended him, and that was more than enough.“If you came out of Arizona during that era, you knew how to play the game,” Fraser said. “And that was mostly because of Lute.”Olson, who has had health issues in recent years, emphasized basketball basics. Each practice began with a series of chest passes. Players worked on their weak hands. The Warriors, who warm up by launching half-court heaves, are slightly less regimented.“If Coach Olson walked in and saw some of this, he’d be shaking his head,” Fraser said. “He’d think we’re so loose.”The Warriors are still mindful of the essentials, though, especially at training camp, where they dribble around traffic cones and throw passes at pitch-back nets configured with targets. If they channel the Harlem Globetrotters, their flamboyance is rooted in bedrock principles.“And I think you could tie a lot of that back to Coach Olson and Arizona,” Fraser said.Kerr played for several legendary N.B.A. coaches — Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Lenny Wilkens, Cotton Fitzsimmons — and he took pieces from each as he developed his own style. Jerry Marvin, his former coach at Palisades High School in Los Angeles, made a big impression, too. But these were coaches with unique approaches.“I think the common thread is their force of personality,” Kerr said. “They all saw the game a little differently and ran different stuff, basing a lot of it on their personnel. But it’s not what made them great coaches. It was having great talent, and then developing a great culture and system so that their talent could flourish.”Olson, for example, adapted to the strengths of his roster. He became more guard-oriented over the years, especially after he recruited high-profile players like Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves and Gilbert Arenas. (Kerr noted how he had been one of the “slow guys in the backcourt” when Olson was just starting out at Arizona.)But Olson was not necessarily trying to outwit anyone by being especially innovative. Basketball, Kerr said, is not like football, where a mastermind like Bill Belichick can lean on his tactical genius to mold the New England Patriots into the most dominant N.F.L. team of his era.“Football is so strategic,” Kerr said. “But in basketball, there aren’t many guys I can think of historically who are the best coaches on earth who were just offensive wizards or defensive wizards. It was more about the culture they built and the way their teams played together — not a style or a system.”It has become a hackneyed concept in sports, as if teams can just crack the code on demand, but Olson was all about culture, his former players say. Jason Terry, a retired N.B.A. guard who played at Arizona from 1995 to 1999, recalled his recruitment. He was not a shy young man, but Olson, at that point firmly established as one of the game’s top coaches, had the sort of gravitas that intimidated him.On the second day of Terry’s official visit to Arizona, Olson and his wife, Bobbi, had him over for pancakes.“These unbelievable pancakes,” Terry, an analyst for Turner Sports, said in a telephone interview. “That was a big part of the recruitment. But I also remember that he kind of came over and put his big paw on my shoulder, and I jumped. He was like, ‘Nothing to be scared of young fella. It’s great to have you in my home.’ And from that point on, you were just at ease.”Olson, Terry said, was the first coach he had who never used profanity. Olson would glare. His face would go red. And those big paws would shake.“But he would never yell,” Terry said. “He would just say your name over and over and over.”Above all, Olson imbued his players with the sense that they were a part of something larger than themselves. Before the national championship game in 1997, two prominent alumni — Kerr and Sean Elliott, both of whom had graduated to the N.B.A. — boarded the team bus. Olson had invited them to address his players, and their message was simple: Do it for all of us who have come before you but could never quite get the job done.Terry saw that Olson had tears in his eyes. Arizona went on to win its first national title by defeating Kentucky in overtime.“We knew that we couldn’t let him down,” Terry said.With the Warriors, Kerr definitely swears on occasion. (Ask Draymond Green.) And the N.B.A. is not college basketball. But Kerr still tries to foster an atmosphere that is more about the collective whole than about its supremely talented parts. Kerr loathes isolation sets. He celebrates ball movement. And he stages team dinners on road trips, where family members are welcome.As for the Pac-12, these are rough days. Arizona, under Coach Sean Miller, has been entwined in a corruption scandal, and the conference could send just one team to the N.C.A.A. tournament. Iguodala described the Pac-12 as garbage (he used a more colorful word), though he expressed hope moving forward. Kerr was more diplomatic.“It’s been a dry spell,” he said. “And I really don’t know the answer.”In fact, the Pac-12 has not won a national championship since Kerr boarded the Arizona team bus back in 1997 and delivered his pregame pep talk. But in his own way, as the Warriors chase another title, he is still carrying the mantle for the conference and his old coach."
"LOS ANGELES — The criminal case involving one of President Trump’s leading adversaries and the world’s biggest shoe company has also ensnared an unlikely figure from the youth basketball world.The coach, Gary Franklin Sr., started his club from scratch in Los Angeles and ran a program known for its rectitude, according to Sonny Vaccaro, the former Nike and Adidas executive who essentially forged the relationship between the shoe industry and the summer youth basketball circuit. What began as a team for Franklin to coach his then 10-year-old son became a powerhouse club that attracted future N.B.A. stars and major college recruits, and one that steered clear of any scandals.“He was one of the guys who built it up through his own resources, and his program had a reputation as one of the ‘good guys,’” Vaccaro said of Franklin in an interview this week.Franklin’s club, California Supreme, and others like it are major participants in a system involving youth basketball, shoe companies and colleges that supplies the professional game with a deep reservoir of talent. And Michael Avenatti knew it.Now Franklin has become a central figure in the case against Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her lawsuit against President Trump. Whether Franklin, who has not been charged, is an accomplice, a co-conspirator or simply collateral damage is not yet clear, but prosecutors’ revelations about his involvement have stunned those who have known him for years.The question in the club basketball world is, could Franklin have morphed from a stickler who played by the rules into the latest symbol of an amateur basketball world that has spun out of control?“Cal Supreme was always the best team for doing things by the book, because there were a lot of other teams that didn’t do it by the book,” said Andy Brown, a former forward for Cal Supreme who went on to play at Stanford. “And Cal Supreme did it by the book.”California Supreme reached its zenith at the 2016 Peach Jam, a summertime showcase for the best travel basketball teams and players in the country. In the final event of the Nike-sponsored league, Deandre Ayton, a towering Bahamian who was about to turn 18, helped the team reel off a huge winning streak before Cal Supreme fell to the eventual champions.For Franklin, a soft-spoken coach from Los Angeles, the run was a triumph. His Nike-sponsored team was one of the best in the country in what is now known as grass-roots basketball.Three years later, Franklin, 51, is in a different spotlight, with federal prosecutors accusing Avenatti of extortion for threatening Nike with the release of information that Avenatti had pledged would damage the company’s stock-market value to the tune of a few billion dollars. Specifically, Avenatti had told Nike lawyers this month that a coach in Nike’s grass-roots basketball league had approached him with information that company employees had paid the families of three players, prosecutors said. Avenatti, prosecutors said, demanded that Nike pay millions to make the whole thing go away.Paying players and their families would violate N.C.A.A. rules, rendering the players ineligible for college play. Also, if the money was paid in exchange for players to commit to colleges Nike sponsors, it would resemble the behavior that recently led to federal fraud convictions for two former Adidas employees.Two people familiar with the investigation confirmed that the unidentified coach in the complaint is Franklin. Nike had recently declined to renew its sponsorship deal with Cal Supreme, which was worth more than $70,000 annually. Franklin could not be reached for comment.Grass-roots basketball is often erroneously called A.A.U. basketball, even in prosecutors’ court filings. That is a misnomer because the elite leagues are not sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union. Rather, they are supported by sneaker companies that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to organize tournaments from April through July. The teenage players who participate are outfitted, from head to toe, in apparel made by and bearing the logo of the league’s sponsor.Sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas also pay thousands of dollars each year to sponsor the teams themselves as a sort of long-term investment strategy: They hope to build brand loyalty among young players who could eventually become stars. Get players into your gear early, the thinking goes, and you may be more likely to land them as spokesmen when they turn pro and have even more influence over the world’s fans — and their wallets.“Sneaker companies want to make money,” said Dr. Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California who was the executive producer of a 2016 documentary, “At All Costs: Life Inside A.A.U. Basketball.” “That’s their objective. And if you have a kid who’s good enough to go on to the N.B.A., and he chooses to continue wearing these shoes, you’ve made a long-term investment that could pay off for years.”At the same time, the grass-roots basketball landscape has shifted in recent years as N.B.A. players like Bradley Beal, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony have increasingly become involved in forming their own teams. These are players who already have partnerships with shoe companies and can help subsidize costs on their own. Last year, Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who has an endorsement deal with Nike’s Jordan brand, organized a Los Angeles-based team that advanced to the playoffs at the Peach Jam.Franklin was far from the N.B.A. when he started his team.A flattering portrait of Franklin is included in “Play Their Hearts Out,” a 2010 book by George Dohrmann that details youth basketball culture in Southern California. Franklin, according to the book, played basketball and football at Los Angeles Valley College. Later, he doted on his son, Gary Jr., creating a club team he initially called the Runnin’ Rebels. He preached fundamentals during their practices at Manual Arts High School and spoke openly about his faith in God. Gary Franklin Jr. went on to play college basketball at Baylor.Cal Supreme did not have lavish resources. When Brown, the Stanford player, was with the team, it practiced at various Los Angeles-area high schools. Parents subsidized costs. And players paid for their own meals at tournaments.Yet neither Brown nor his teammates were naïve about the world they inhabited.“Everybody who played knew what was going on,” Brown said. “We all knew people who were getting paid, we all knew people who were getting free stuff — we all knew it. Now, it’s all coming out. So it’s shocking, but it’s not shocking, because we all knew it was happening.”For years, the sponsorship deals have been heavily dependent on grass-roots coaches’ attracting the best players to their programs. Cal Supreme appeared to have enough talent over the years to keep Nike interested, producing players who ultimately landed at major college programs like Southern California, Oregon and Arizona, along with several who went to the N.B.A.Big names circled in Cal Supreme’s orbit. Miles Simon, a guard who had won an N.C.A.A. championship while playing at Arizona, was one of the program’s coaches from 2011 to 2014. (Simon, who now works as an assistant for the Lakers, declined to comment through a Lakers spokeswoman.) Shareef O’Neal, a top-tier recruit and the son of Shaquille O’Neal, played for Cal Supreme before going to U.C.L.A. More recently, Percy Miller, the businessman and rapper known as Master P, was listed on Cal Supreme’s website as a team partner.Ayton, who spent a season at Arizona before the Phoenix Suns made him the top overall pick in the 2018 N.B.A. draft, was Cal Supreme’s highest-profile player. But in a twist, after years of wearing Nikes, Ayton signed a lucrative deal to wear Pumas when he went to the N.B.A. For Nike, it was an investment that did not pay off.It remains unclear whether Ayton’s deal played any role in Nike’s decision not to extend its sponsorship deal with Cal Supreme.Cassius Stanley, a top-30 recruit and a senior at Sierra Canyon High School outside Los Angeles, played for Cal Supreme in 2016 and for Westbrook’s team in 2018. His father, Jerome Stanley, who works as a lawyer, said that as far as he knew, Nike had never provided Cal Supreme players or their family members with benefits that would violate N.C.A.A. rules.“It is very sad that Coach Gary has gotten himself tangled up in this mess,” Stanley said. “I feel bad for him and his family, and I pray that he and his lawyers can help him move on and not be damaged or used any more than he has been the past few days.”"
"The technology used for game clocks has become part of a basketball referee's on-court DNA, something few could see coming considering the system was initially scoffed at by some officials.The Precision Time system created more than two decades ago by former referee Mike Costabile currently is used at nearly every level of the sport, including the NBA and college basketball's NCAA Tournament. Costabile estimates by stopping the clock automatically on a referee's whistle can save roughly 90 seconds formerly lost to reaction time when timekeepers manually stopped the clock.The improved technology also makes the refs' whistle essentially their fingerprints. The system uses a specific type of whistle with calibration precise enough to identify the sound coming from each official. That allows the system to produce an on-demand list of every start and stoppage, and who caused it.While the data isn't being used to evaluate officials for things such as tournament assignments, Costabile said that ""wealth of information"" can be used however conferences see fit in the future.""I think it makes us all better clock officials,"" said veteran official Mike Eades, who has worked four Final Fours and in numerous major conferences. ""I've been doing it a long time, it's kind of second nature. I know it's going to stop it, I know I've got to start it and I know I'm always looking at the clock to make sure it's running when it should be or stops when it shouldn't.""Any time we're able to catch it when it doesn't do one or the other and fix it right away, it makes us look like, 'Hey, those guys know what they're doing.'""Officials are so accustomed to having Precision Time that they instinctively check the clock on each whistle and reach for their beltpack button on every stoppage.""The best example is that like a golf club in a golfer's hand, the officials that use Precision Time, it becomes a part of how they do what they do,"" said J.D. Collins, the NCAA national coordinator of men's basketball officiating.""We have signals that we use when we start the clock. Well now, you've got one hand on the box, you've got one hand out, you count time differently. It changes some signaling mechanics, but because it's used so widely, the top officials all know how to use it. And it becomes part of their DNA quite frankly.""Precision Time has long been used in most major conferences for men's and women's college basketball. The NCAA adopted the system for its tournaments in 2015, the same year Collins assumed his job after years of refereeing games using Precision Time.That wasn't necessarily the goal when Costabile created the system in the 1990s. Back then, it was simply about giving officials the ability to instantly stop the clock on any foul or out-of-bounds call, then control exactly when it restarts.Now it's a routine part of the game, largely going unnoticed.""It's great technology. It helps our guys,"" said Atlantic Coast Conference coordinator of men's basketball officiating Bryan Kersey, adding: ""It's habitual, it's part of our game and it's here forever.""The system uses a microphone attached near the referee's whistle. A beltpack on their waist transmits a clock-stopping radio signal at the whistle and one to restart it when the referee presses the button on the pack's side. That signal goes to a base station at the scorers' table to start and stop the clock.That station has a manual control for a timekeeper, though only as a backstop.""From the time (referees) blow the whistle — which is at the speed of light over to the scorer's table, again we're using radio waves — once it hears the frequency of the whistle, it stops the clock,"" said Costabile, who lives in North Carolina after a career of officiating high school, college and NBA games. ""It's that fast.""Costabile estimates it takes 0.6 to 0.8 seconds, sometimes longer, for a timekeeper to react to a whistle and manually stop the clock. And with roughly 60 to 80 whistles per game for fouls or out-of-bounds calls, those added seconds are invaluable at the end of games when referees often turn to replay to adjust the clock.And with college basketball fans around the country counting down the seconds at the Final Four this weekend in Minneapolis, officials will be counting on the system.It wasn't always that way. Costabile remembers when some skeptical leagues needed convincing when it came to adopting his then-new technology.""Sure, they thought I was crazy,"" Costabile said. ""And then all of a sudden, they finally started seeing that these problems in their game were really there, and they go, 'Well maybe this thing will fix it.' And it did.""Kersey, a former official who used Precision Time for years, recalls Costabile bringing his invention to ACC officials for a demonstration. So impressed, Kersey left the room saying, ""Whoa.""""One of the things that we stress in all of our meetings and all of our memos and training videos is clock awareness, so this does give them that,"" Kersey said. ""Because we want them to start it on every live ball, so it makes them hit the button and look at the clock to see that it has started.""Same thing, we want them to blow the whistle and notice the clock. We want them to know the difference in the game clock and the shot clock. ... So it makes them better at being clock aware of the whole game.""The system isn't designed to take the human element out of officiating, it just ensures refs are taking full advantage of the technology.""The only human reaction time we have now is coming from the official,"" Costabile said, ""because they have to visually see the play and then react and call a foul.""When the referee blows the whistle, the clock stops, on the whistle. And that's what they want, especially when the game's tight,"" Costabile added. ""You want to have that clock stopping, because the team that's fouling (late) wants the time to give them the opportunity to score.""______"
"Dwyane Wade says it's time college basketball got a makeover.Wade sits down with PodcastOne Sports Now to talk about the NCAA Tournament and the memories he has of his Final Four run with Marquette in 2003. The conversation with guest host and AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds also includes the Miami Heat star saying it's time to fix what ails the college game. Wade says he can envision the sort of sweeping change that former NBA commissioner David Stern and current commissioner Adam Silver have brought to the pro game.Also in the episode, Abilene Christian coach Joe Golding talks about what's next for his program after it made the tourney for the first time. Golding knew his team wasn't going to beat Kentucky in the first round, but he believes that just getting on that stage will pay dividends to his program for years to come. He knows people will remember the story of his one suit and how the pants were ripped, but hopes that more people liked what they saw from the Abilene Christian brand."
"Jusuf Nurkic's season-ending and gruesome leg injury, especially at this time of year, will strike fear into everyone in the NBA.In this age of ""load management"" being a fancy term for ""night off"" and even as the NBA frowns upon resting players anyway, the question will be asked: Should teams sit their stars down the stretch to protect them from something bad happening before the playoffs?Answers may vary, but the reality is that most teams in this season's playoff chase might not have the luxury of finding out.Golden State has gotten players some rest of late, been blown out in those games and hasn't seemed to mind too much. This is the edge the Warriors have; they are the only team in the NBA right now that absolutely knows it is good enough to win a championship. Milwaukee will likely get some guys some rest when it clinches the No. 1 seed, but losing Malcolm Brogdon for a few weeks already is a reminder that health is everything.""You're going to have things that happen,"" Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said.All those teams battling for their playoff lives in the East — Brooklyn, Detroit, Miami, Orlando, Charlotte — can't really afford to give any healthy guys nights off right now. Out West, while the field is basically known — Utah, the Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio and Oklahoma City are all likely in, barring massive collapses — the jostling for seedings will go to the wire.There's analytics for everything. Every possession is charted. Every minute played matters. These are real things and helpful things in a data age, and the numbers show that rest can be an enormous aid to everyone.But at this point in the season, luck might matter more than anything else.Bad breaks will happen, literally in Nurkic's case. Bad luck, if it wants to find a team, will find a team.The Portland Trail Blazers obviously aren't at fault, since there was no way to foresee something like what occurred Monday night when Nurkic broke his tibia and fibia — an injury that doesn't just end his 2018-19 season but puts the 2019-20 season in doubt as well.The thing is, it's not avoidable. Nonetheless, the approach differs by team and by player.""I'm definitely taking some games off before the playoffs,"" Boston guard Kyrie Irving said a few days ago. ""Makes no sense, the emphasis on these regular games, when you're gearing up for some battles coming in the playoffs.""The Celtics aren't even assured of home-court in the first round. In fact, the odds are that they'll open the playoffs on the road. No matter. Irving wants some rest, so he'll likely get some rest.Meanwhile, Toronto can pretty much pencil itself in as the No. 2 seed in the East and with home-court advantage for at least two rounds. But Kyle Lowry is playing despite bad ankles and a 33-year-old body that might benefit greatly from time off before Round 1 begins in less than three weeks.""I can sit out until the playoffs with the type of injury that I have,"" Lowry said earlier this week. ""But I want to play, keep a rhythm, get out there with the guys and play some basketball. If I can get out there and play, I'm going to go play.""The Raptors added Jodie Meeks, which should help minimize Lowry's workload down the stretch. The Celtics added Greg Monroe, which means Al Horford likely won't take so much of a pounding in the final games of the regular season. Golden State added Andrew Bogut, and one of the many upsides of that move is that DeMarcus Cousins should be as fresh as possible for his first playoff game ever in a couple weeks.The Blazers will probably add someone now as well. But whoever that is, he won't replace Nurkic's 15 points and 10 rebounds per game, or his defense, or his spacing that Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum need someone to provide so they can be at their best. The Western Conference is hard enough at playoff time, and going in without a major player like Nurkic only will make the task even harder for Portland now.No one wanted it. No one could have predicted it. And there is no surefire way to avoid it.___Tim Reynolds is a national basketball writer for The Associated Press. Write to him at treynolds@ap.org___"
"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The families of several University of North Carolina women’s basketball players complained last week of racially insensitive remarks by Sylvia Hatchell, the program’s Hall of Fame coach, who was subsequently put on leave, according to two people with direct knowledge of the allegations.Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, said in an interview Thursday that his client was aware of the accusations that were described in detail by one of the people with direct knowledge. He said his client’s words had been misquoted or misconstrued.The families detailed their concerns in a meeting that some U.N.C. officials attended in Chapel Hill while the athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, joined by video conference from another location, according to the person who described the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.The meeting included accusations that Hatchell had warned that a loss to Louisville could lead to “nooses,” according to the person, and that the coach had once urged players to do a “tomahawk chop” war cry, a request the women resisted.Within days of the meeting, the university, which has been in the midst of a reckoning over racism and Confederate history, announced that Hatchell and her three assistants would be put on paid administrative leave while an outside law firm conducted a review to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.”The announcement stunned North Carolina and appeared abrupt, but in the discussion with university officials on March 28, players’ relatives said Hatchell’s conduct had caused discomfort during at least two basketball seasons, according to the person.The families also told university officials that Hatchell had complained that her team played like “old mules” during a game against Georgia Tech — a remark that some took as a reference to female slaves and that caused at least one player to cry, according to the person.In another instance, according to the person, the families said that Hatchell had warned that if U.N.C. turned in a middling performance against Louisville, “nooses” would await.“If you guys play this way against Louisville, they’re going to take y’all outside with some nooses,” Hatchell said, according to the person, who was told of the remark by people who were present.The reference to “nooses,” the person said, led to two apologies from Hatchell, the second because players thought the first one had lacked sincerity. The players remained frustrated with their coach but elected to wait until the off-season to address their concerns.Smith said the coach had used different words when warning about the coming Louisville game. “She said words like: ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” the lawyer said.Smith said his client “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”Allegations of racism against Hatchell were first reported by The Washington Post.Five days after U.N.C.’s season ended, with a 20-point loss to California in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the families voiced their grievances in the meeting.A North Carolina athletic department spokesman declined to comment. When the university announced the review on Monday, it said it was “committed to the well-being of our student-athletes and to ensuring that they have the best experience possible in and outside of competition.”U.N.C. players either declined to comment or did not respond to messages. It was not clear which of the team’s players were represented when the relatives spoke with Cunningham and the other U.N.C. employees. No members of the coaching staff attended the meeting, which was organized after some players’ relatives held a conference call on March 25, the person said.Smith said Thursday that the coach’s suggestion of the tomahawk chop, often seen at Florida State athletic events, was a motivational tool, and he said that Hatchell had often tried to commandeer the traditions of other schools to inspire her team.The lawyer said that Hatchell had intended no offense in that episode and that she did not recall making any statements about “old mules.”The person who described the allegations against Hatchell did not know of any specific accusations against the assistant coaches.The North Carolina women’s basketball team has had great success under Hatchell, particularly in the 1990s and the 2000s. The Tar Heels won their sole national championship in 1994.Hatchell, who recently completed her 33rd season at North Carolina, is one of a handful of college basketball coaches with more than 1,000 career wins, and she is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In her first college coaching job, Hatchell oversaw the junior varsity team at Tennessee in the team’s first season under Pat Summitt, a trailblazing head coach.But in this decade, North Carolina has only twice reached the second weekend of the N.C.A.A. tournament, both times thanks to four players from its highly regarded recruiting class in 2013. After two seasons, all four players had transferred out of the program. This year, the team finished at 18-15.Smith said on Thursday that, despite the allegations, he hoped Hatchell would be able to return to coaching at North Carolina.“I want her to,” he said. “I believe this is a case in which things are not what they seem.”On Thursday morning, Hatchell’s executive assistant sent an email to season-ticket holders. The season-end banquet had been postponed.“Those who have paid for tickets will be refunded,” the email said. “When the banquet is rescheduled, we will contact you with more information.”"
"MELBOURNE, Australia — An Australian basketball association that runs tournaments for teenagers from the country’s South Sudanese community said that xenophobic attitudes had forced it to cancel its annual December tournament.The South Sudanese Australian National Basketball Association has been a pipeline for athletes who go on to play in colleges in the United States and even the N.B.A. It said in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday that the exaggerated news media coverage of gang violence meant that it had struggled to find stadiums willing to host the league this year.“Stadium managers are afraid to host our event because of the African gang stories they see in the news,” the statement read.In recent years, isolated incidents of violence among South Sudanese youth in Melbourne have received wide attention in the news media, which some critics say has fueled panic and racist attitudes. Some politicians have also stoked fears of so-called African gangs. And while there have been criminal incidents involving young people with South Sudanese backgrounds, the majority of crimes in the state of Victoria are committed by people born in Australia, government figures show.But for the basketball association — and the South Sudanese community — the damage has been done. The association said that extensive negative coverage of Sudanese youth had made it difficult to find a stadium willing to host its summer tournament. And those who have considered hosting have imposed “unrealistic barriers” — including restrictions on the hours the event could run and limits on crowd sizes — that made the event unfeasible, the group’s statement said.Such requirements are rarely imposed on other sporting events, said Karen Pearce, a manager of strategy and inclusion with Basketball Victoria, the state’s leading basketball organization.Ms. Pearce said while it was possible the restrictions were not rooted in racist attitudes, that could “unfortunately” be the case.“I would hate to think that it is,” she added, “because what we’re running is a basketball tournament for a bunch of people who love their basketball.”The South Sudanese Australian National Basketball Association holds tournaments twice a year — the National Classic in July and the Summer Slam in December — which, according to the group, usually involve up to 500 players and 1,000 spectators.For the last few years, the tournaments have been held at Eagle Stadium in Wyndham, in the outer southwestern suburbs of Melbourne. But this year, the stadium decided not to host the event.“They said that we couldn’t do the tournament this year in their facility because they had concerns,” said Manny Berberi, the basketball association’s manager. Mr. Berberi said the venue had initially agreed to host the tournament, but that decision was later blocked by the local council.In a statement, the Wyndham council, which oversees the venue, said it decided not to host the tournament because of “capacity issues.”Advocates for the Sudanese community said the failure to find a host for the games was a blow.“There’s not a lot of events that cater for the South Sudanese community in Australia,” said Nyadol Nyuon, a Sudanese-born lawyer and community advocate. “It’s denying a whole community an opportunity to celebrate,” she said.Mr. Berberi said that he did not “want to be too quick to play the race card because at the moment, we’re still assessing the situation.” But, he added, it was “probably an issue of fear.”Both he and Ms. Pearce said they hoped to find a host so the tournament could resume next year.Mr. Berberi said that while there might be issues among some South Sudanese youth, basketball had the potential to be “a huge part of the solution.”He added, “The kids just want to play basketball at the end of the day.”Want more Australia coverage and discussion?

"Jonas Wood’s East Hollywood studio — a refurbished industrial space hidden behind a razor-wired metal gate — is populated with the familiar objects that appear in his paintings. There are colonies of potted plants and basketball paraphernalia that ranges in size from plush couch cushions to man-sized orbs. Every room is filled with art, most notably by the ceramist Shio Kusaka, Wood’s studio mate and wife, and Kiki and Momo, their son and daughter. But the studio is where Wood culls various photographs from the internet or his own archive and uses them as source material for his paintings — they are printed out and pinned onto walls, then flattened and distilled into blocks of color. Wood then layers these dense graphic patterns, overlapping fields of stipples and stripes, circles, squares, dots and wood grains.[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]Thirteen years into his career, following a year and a half of preparation, Wood is finally wrapping up preparations for the two biggest shows he’s ever done: an exhibition of new work at Gagosian in New York, opening in late April, and a survey at the Dallas Museum of Art, opening this week — his first major solo museum exhibition. Admittedly, the prospect of facing works — landscapes, interiors and portraits of family and friends — from his early career was giving Wood “a hard time sleeping.” He wondered, “Are the old paintings horrible?” and “Did I used to be a better painter and now I’m worse?” During the installation of the show at the museum last week, he had two big realizations: “I wasn’t a hack, which is a big relief,” and that now, after more than a decade of steadily producing gallery shows, he might be ready to slow down.Nursing a can of tangerine-flavored LaCroix, Wood answered T’s Artist’s Questionnaire, which unearthed memories of the early days of his career, the first painting he ever sold — and the YouTube videos that nearly brought him to tears.What is your day like? How much do you sleep, and what’s your work schedule like?I drop the kids off at school, eat some breakfast, start working a little bit, usually have a meeting, have lunch and work for a couple hours in the afternoon. Maybe I’ll work for a couple hours at night. I’m trying to sleep more. In general, in the last couple of years, I’ve been trying to balance sleeping, eating, working, working out and spending time with the family. I’ve had my head down trying to make it as an artist since 2006, and I’ve had one or two shows a year for 12 years in a row. It’s not that I want to paint less, per se, but I want to take a step back.I’m talking about taking a step back and looking at what I’ve done, and taking a step back from the pace that I was running and changing gears. After these two exhibitions, I don’t have any booked shows coming up. It’s a big opportunity for me to rearrange the way I spend my time. I love to paint and I want to paint, but I don’t have to paint right now, this second, and I don’t have to paint all next week and miss four school events.How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day?Every day, I’m super into it. I need to paint. If I go away for a couple weeks, I’ll just draw. It’s like a must for my mental health. I would have to say that I’ve been all-in on painting since I was younger, and I realized that it was because of a lot of fear that it would all go away. That’s not how I want to paint in the future. The pressure and psychology of that setup isn’t totally right. I would like to build bodies of work outside the calendar schedule of art fairs and shows for a little while. I love painting, and I think I can paint without having a giant carrot in front of me. I don’t think that I’m the best at painting, and I want to get better at it.What’s the first piece of art you ever made?The first painting I really cared about was probably when I was a teenager, maybe 13 or 14 years old.What’s the worst studio you ever had?The freezing-cold basement of my parents’ house on Martha’s Vineyard. Winter of 2002.What’s the first work you ever sold? For how much?I sold a painting after college for $1,000, before grad school.When you start a new piece, where do you begin? What’s the first step?I think there’s a certain amount of avoidance. I like to have things sit around for a while before it’s go time. I find a photograph that I like, and then I usually make drawings. Maybe half the time I paint from the drawings and the other half from photographs. I use the photo for the structure of the painting; I project out different shapes, trace it out, mix the colors and build an image, like a flat map, and then I paint all the details on top. I like to have things just starting and just finishing and everywhere in between. I like to wake up and have choices to gravitate to.How do you know when you’re done?You know after a lot of looking.How many assistants do you have?Two.What music do you play when you’re making art?Mostly basketball podcasts. I listen to Howard Stern three days a week. Reggae, lots of eras of hip-hop, a variety of rock ’n’ roll.When did you first feel comfortable saying you’re a professional artist?I was a slow learner and a late bloomer in painting. I didn’t really put it all together until 2006. I had a show at Black Dragon Society. I made $29,000, I quit my job, and after 2006, I was a full-time painter. Making a living from being an artist and not having to do anything else usually changes a lot — something happens, sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s bad, right? But you spend all your time doing it. You’re dedicated.Are you bingeing on any shows right now?Oh yeah. “Crashing,” “Million Dollar Listing,” “Vanderpump Rules.”What’s the weirdest object in your studio?This giant basketball is a sculpture by Paa Joe, a 72-year-old Ghanaian artist. Look him up. He makes fantasy coffins that are in most major museum collections. This was commissioned; I wanted a giant Spalding basketball, and I told him the colors and everything. I didn’t get a coffin because my wife thought it would be too morbid, so we got a throne. It’s actually called a palanquin, and you carry people around in it.How do you get your news?I just started listening to these quick little podcasts that The New York Times does. I read The New York Times. I go to CNN a little bit and check out some weirder news, like serial-killer names and stuff like that.What do you do when you’re procrastinating?Play poker with friends. What’s the last thing that made you cry?It’s hilarious that this made me cry: The kids wanted to watch N.B.A. players flying into the stands trying to get out-of-bounds balls. I was like, “This is so cool that they’re so into basketball.” Even thinking about it makes me — it’s like happy crying. Positive. These kids want to see replays of Shaq, who’s seven feet tall, flying into the stands. You should watch it.What do you usually wear when you work?Gym shorts and a T-shirt, or some sort of long, funky pants. I like to feel super comfortable.What do you buy in bulk with the most frequency?LaCroix. I’ve got a variety of favorite flavors.What do you pay for rent?We don’t pay rent. We own the building.Do you exercise?We have a little gym. I would like to say that I’m fat and I’m also fit at the same time. I have a routine. VersaClimber and a lot of bands to strengthen the buttocks.What’s your favorite artwork by someone else?I love that Picasso goat he made out of bronze, where he uses a basket for the goat’s tummy. It’s one of the great bronze sculptures.This interview has been edited and condensed."
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Consider the following scenes from the N.B.A.’s annual bacchanal/business convention known as All-Star weekend:Spike Lee standing on a street corner waiting for the crosswalk signal. Stan Kroenke, whose family owns the Denver Nuggets, holding court in a hotel lobby. Joel Embiid, the star center of the Philadelphia 76ers, making small talk with the governor of North Carolina. An army of personal stylists waiting to be summoned by their clients for some of the flashiest events of the year.And then there were the agents and league officials and sneakerheads and reporters, some of whom traveled great distances to make unconventional requests of the weekend’s main attractions.“Shout out to my fans in Mongolia!” John Collins of the Atlanta Hawks yelled into a camera the morning before his appearance in the Saturday slam dunk contest.[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo’s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame]All-Star weekend tends to be a blend of basketball and branding, business and pleasure — a showcase for a powerful league whose global influence continues to expand.“The whole weekend,” Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies said, “is just a big party.”The All-Star Game itself, scheduled for Sunday night, felt secondary to just about everything else in the host city, as it has for many years. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, recalled waiting in line in 2006 for one of the more popular parties at All-Star weekend in Houston, where he watched Maciej Lampe — a center from Poland who appeared in 64 career games over parts of three seasons — bypass the line so that he could immediately be waved inside by security.“And I’m like, ‘Man, I’m behind Maciej Lampe?’” said Morey, who would officially join the front office of the Rockets a little more than six weeks later.All-Star weekend has only grown in recent years. One spreadsheet making the rounds in Charlotte listed more than 100 parties, and that did not include many of the more exclusive events. (Michael Jordan hosted a big one.) Thanks to a change in the league schedule, there is more partying and less deal-making than there used to be.Last year, the league moved the trade deadline up so that it preceded All-Star weekend. In the past, the deadline came a few days after the game, a sequence which helped create its share of absurdity. One of the more notorious examples came in 2017, when word leaked during the fourth quarter of the All-Star Game that the New Orleans Pelicans had struck a deal to acquire DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings. Cousins learned of the trade during postgame interviews.The weekend vibe is different now.“It’s so much more fun,” one prominent agent said at a party that he hosted.In the corner, a disc jockey who appeared to be in his 60s spun tunes in a Hawaiian shirt and red-tinted glasses, while women wearing bright red dresses passed out hors d’oeuvres. Agents, clients and marketing honchos milled about the room.But none of this is meant to suggest that deals do not get done.On Thursday night, at a downtown hotel bar where patrons sipped $25 cocktails, a crowd of very tall men gathered as a private event wound down at a nearby steakhouse. Among the luminaries who emerged from the event: Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner; Kroenke, who also owns the Los Angeles Rams; Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s chief media and business officer; Bill Simmons, the founder of The Ringer; Connor Schell, ESPN’s executive vice president for content; and Bob Myers, the general manager of the Golden State Warriors.“There are definitely conversations happening,” Morey said. “And there’s serendipity involved. You’re always bumping into people.”Morey was finishing lunch at an upscale restaurant. Warren LeGarie, a longtime agent to many coaches and executives, and Kiki Vandeweghe, the league’s executive vice president for basketball operations, were dining at nearby tables. Morey was about to head into a meeting with Vandeweghe and Monty McCutchen, who supervises the league’s referees.“Obviously, we care deeply about where the league is going,” Morey said, “so talking to Adam Silver about strategy or Monty McCutchen about changing how they might call certain things — all that kind of stuff could impact our franchise moving forward, so I try to be involved.”The atmosphere may seem more relaxed than it was two years ago, when most team executives and agents were focused on the trade deadline, but the shift in the schedule has not pushed aside the league’s most pressing issues.In Charlotte, a cloud loomed over the festivities, and it came in the shape of a unibrow.Perhaps you have heard? Anthony Davis, the star center for the Pelicans, requested a trade 10 days before the deadline.The Pelicans, though, rejected all trade offers for him and instead hope to reap better players and draft picks in a deal this summer. Last week, Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry called the drama of it all a “dumpster fire.” On Friday, the Pelicans fired their general manager. On Saturday, Davis told reporters that his list of preferred destinations included the Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. Hours later, Silver said he would like trade demands and discussions to remain behind closed doors.In any case, the Davis situation only underscored how much the topic of player movement dominates the league — even in the middle of the season, and even after the trade deadline. Everyone here was fixated on what could happen just over four months from now — at the start of free agency.Will Kevin Durant leave the Warriors? Will Kawhi Leonard spurn the Toronto Raptors? Will Kyrie Irving bolt from the Boston Celtics? And, again, what about Davis?“No one likes to see an instance,” Silver said, “where a player is demanding that he be traded when he’s still in the middle of a contractual obligation to a team.”Silver made those remarks, and his wish for private trade discussions, at a news conference before Saturday night’s skills, dunk and 3-point competitions.The media forum, like the carefully coordinated outfits stars wore to events around town, has become part of the event’s routine. So has the roll call of courtside A-listers during the dunk contest; this year’s included the rappers Quavo, 2 Chainz, J. Cole and Gucci Mane.All-Star weekend was not always so structured — or extravagant. Paul Westphal recalled making his first trip to an All-Star Game in 1977 as a guard for the Phoenix Suns. The league hosted a modest dinner. Players received commemorative mugs. Anyone associated with the game stayed at the same hotel in downtown Milwaukee.“It wasn’t like it is now where the game takes over the whole city,” Westphal said.Kareem Abdul-Jabbar missed practice, Westphal said, then showed up about 20 minutes before the start of the game in a fur coat. Westphal helped seal his team’s win with a late steal against Pete Maravich. It was a moment he said he would never forget.This weekend, Westphal was in Charlotte, where he was named a finalist for the Basketball Hall of Fame. He said he was not planning to attend any parties.“Just dinner with friends,” he said.In Charlotte, the streets around the host arena, Spectrum Center, were choked with traffic. Concert fliers hung from every lamppost. And none of the guests, spread among numerous hotels at premium nightly rates, seemed to mind the cold weather as countless lines formed for restaurants, bars and pop-up musical performances.Given all the extracurriculars, it was easy to forget that basketball was the only reason anyone was here in the first place — and perhaps that was because the only legitimate basketball was being played in a college gymnasium a few miles from downtown. A group of elite teenage prospects, without much fanfare, had convened for the league’s annual Basketball Without Borders Global Camp.In all, 63 boys and girls from 31 countries played in front of scouts and executives who hoped to identify the sport’s next batch of stars.“There’s a lot of talent here,” said Brooks Meek, the N.B.A.’s vice president for international basketball operations.The spotlight will find them soon enough."
"ATLANTA — MaChelle Joseph was fired Tuesday after nearly 16 seasons as the women's basketball coach at Georgia Tech, with the two sides giving strikingly different reasons for her dismissal.The school, which suspended Joseph late in the season for what it would only describe as a personnel matter, said it was left with no choice after an independent investigation into alleged mistreatment of players and staff, as well as possible NCAA violations.Joseph's attorney reiterated that her client was being punished for complaining about gender equity issues at the Atlantic Coast Conference school, which is already facing NCAA allegations of wrongdoing in its men's basketball program as well as mourning the unexpected death of a football player this past weekend.The Yellow Jackets women's team closed the season on a four-game losing streak, three of those defeats coming after Joseph was placed on leave Feb. 27. Two of Georgia Tech's top four scorers quit the team at the same time.The 49-year-old Joseph was the winningest coach in school history with a record of 311-198. She guided her team to seven NCAA Tournament appearances, the last coming in 2014.Georgia Tech said it hired the labor law firm of Littler Mendelson on Feb. 25 after players came forward with concerns about Joseph's treatment of player and staff. According to a school statement, the firm interviewed 40 people including Joseph, her assistant coaches, all 13 members of the team, administrators and support staff, as well as parents of the athletes.Littler Mendelson's report, which was submitted to the school last week, found that every player reported ""concerns regarding alleged emotional or mental mistreatment"" by Joseph, and that they described the environment around the team as ""toxic"" and ""hostile,"" according to Georgia Tech. It also described Joseph's conduct as ""bullying"" and ""emotionally, mentally and verbally 'abusive.'""In addition, several players made allegations that would be violations of NCAA rules, the school said. Georgia Tech has reported the allegations to the NCAA.Lisa Banks, Joseph's attorney, disputed the report.""That allegation is false and was expressly refuted by officials close to the team and outside experts,"" the attorney said. ""Coach Joseph is tough but fair.""Banks added that Joseph has ""received countless messages from former and current players, parents, and staff expressing their love, admiration, and respect. These messages reveal the truth and will be her legacy.""A glaring disparity between the men's and women's program was the main issue, according to Banks.""For years, Georgia Tech has provided sub-standard resources to its women's basketball program including in facilities, marketing, travel, and funding,"" Banks said. ""She has been accused of 'attacking' Georgia Tech through her efforts, and top athletic department officials vowed to 'get rid' of her. Georgia Tech finally accomplished that goal by manufacturing allegations against her and manipulating an investigation to make it appear that she engaged in unacceptable coaching practices.""Georgia Tech said Joseph was given the opportunity to respond to the report, which she did on Monday. Athletic director Todd Stansbury met with the suspended coach on Tuesday to inform her that she was fired.""The findings outlined in the report have left us no choice,"" Stansbury said. ""I am disappointed and saddened to learn that the well-being of our student-athletes was being compromised.""The case is likely to spur additional legal action.""Coach Joseph will not be silenced,"" Banks vowed. ""She will continue to fight for equality in women's athletics and for justice related to the discrimination and retaliation she has suffered at the hands of the Georgia Tech athletic department.""Assistant coach Mark Simons served as acting head coach after Joseph was suspended. Georgia Tech finished the season 17-13, including a 7-9 mark in the ACC.""I will be forever grateful for all of the young women who took a chance on Tech and on me,"" Joseph said in a statement issued by her attorney. ""They have forever changed this program and my life.""Joseph, who played at Purdue, joined the Georgia Tech staff in 2001. After two years as an assistant, she took over as head coach when Agnus Berenato moved to Pittsburgh.Beginning in 2007, Georgia Tech made six straight appearances in the NCAA Tournament. Its best season came in 2011-12, when the Yellow Jackets finished 26-9 overall, 12-4 in the ACC and reached the Sweet 16.Though this year's team failed to receive a postseason bid, Joseph insisted the future was bright for a program that claimed two of the last three ACC freshman of the year awards, including this year's winner, Elizabeth Balogun.After Georgia Tech's season ended with a loss to North Carolina in the ACC tournament, Simons praised Joseph.""She put this team together. She recruited this team,"" he said. ""She's my friend. She's my boss and the reason I came to Tech.""Georgia Tech began the search for a new coach less than 24 hours after a memorial service for football lineman Brandon Adams, who died suddenly this past weekend at age 21. Also, the school announced March 15 that the NCAA found major recruiting violations in the men's program involving a former assistant coach and an ex-friend of head coach Josh Pastner.___Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/paul%20newberry___"
"Marc Stein, an N.B.A. reporter for more than 30 years who now covers the league for The New York Times, and Ralph Lawler, longtime broadcaster for the Los Angeles Clippers, were honored on Friday by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which named them as the 2019 Curt Gowdy Media Award recipients for their contributions to basketball.Stein, 49, and Lawler, 80, will be among those honored at the Hall of Fame’s September enshrinement ceremonies in Springfield, Mass.Stein started his career covering the Clippers and then the Lakers for The Los Angeles Daily News, before moving to The Dallas Morning News as a Mavericks beat reporter and eventually a national columnist. From there, he went to ESPN for 15 years, developing a reputation for breaking news and helping the network build its digital coverage of the N.B.A. He joined The Times in 2017.Lawler has announced that he will retire at the end of this season after more than 2,000 broadcasts in his 30 years with the Clippers.

"A student at a Catholic school in Kentucky has sued the Northern Kentucky Health Department, claiming it violated his First Amendment rights by barring him from playing basketball because he refused to be vaccinated against chickenpox.The lawsuit, filed last week in Boone County Circuit Court on behalf of the student, Jerome Kunkel, an 18-year-old senior, argues that the action violates his right to freedom of religion. Being vaccinated, it contends, would go against Mr. Kunkel’s religious beliefs as a practicing Catholic, because the vaccine contains “aborted fetal cells.”The lawsuit came after an outbreak of chickenpox at Assumption Academy in Walton, Ky., prompted officials to send out two warnings in February.On March 14, the Health Department issued a statement saying that because there had been 32 cases of chickenpox at the school, students who were not vaccinated or already immune could not attend school “until 21 days after the onset of rash for the last ill student or staff member.” The statement also said all school extracurricular events would be canceled.Mr. Kunkel’s lawyer, Chris Wiest, said in an interview on Monday that the school had told him in February that he could not play in or attend any basketball games because he was not vaccinated.Mr. Kunkel is also now barred from attending school because of the Health Department’s action.“I’m pretty devastated,” Mr. Kunkel, who was captain of the basketball team, said in an interview on Monday night. After playing for all four years of high school, “for it come crashing down at the end, it’s not very fun,” he added. Mr. Kunkel was not able to play in the last three games of the season.The lawsuit contends that in Kentucky, students are allowed a vaccination exemption on religious grounds if they provide a sworn statement, which Mr. Kunkel did in early 2018.The chickenpox vaccine is grown in cells originally derived from fetuses aborted in the early 1960s. Vaccines may contain nanofragments of DNA from the fetal cells, which are used because human viruses do not grow well in animal cells, according to a statement the vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, gave to ABC News.It is unclear how many students have been barred from attending the school because they have not been vaccinated or were found to be immune. Mr. Wiest, however, said that the parents of at least 18 children at the school had contacted him since the Health Department’s announcement.“I think this is going to be a much bigger fight at the end of the day,” Mr. Wiest said.Officials at the school did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. But the Health Department defended its response to the outbreak.The action, the department said in its statement, was “in direct response to a public health threat and was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness.” A spokesman for the department declined to comment further."

Here’s a guide to Tuesday’s voting. Antibiotics, which have been credited with saving tens of millions of lives, have never been more accessible to the poor, thanks largely to the mass production of generics in China and India. Across much of the developing world, a few dollars will buy drugs like amoxicillin, which treats a broad range of infections.But the increasingly available drugs are losing their ability to kill the germs they were designed to cure. Poverty is a huge and largely unappreciated driver of antibiotic resistance, which is often viewed as a problem in rich countries.“We are quickly running out of treatment options,” a researcher in Kenya said. “If we don’t get a handle on the problem, I fear for the future.”Another angle: A fungus called Candida auris preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe.

"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Sylvia Hatchell, the University of North Carolina women’s basketball coach, used to preach about “the fishbowl.”“You’re always in the fishbowl,” Hatchell would tell players like Tonya Sampson, a former player who recalled the admonitions in an interview on Friday. “You never know who’s watching. You’ve always got to carry yourself with integrity and the best way you can.”Twenty-five years after Hatchell and Sampson won a national title for North Carolina, Hatchell’s reputation is in peril and her team is in turmoil. U.N.C. officials, who were told late last month about three episodes that some players thought revealed Hatchell to be racially insensitive and aloof, placed her and her assistants on paid administrative leave and opened a storied program to abrupt scrutiny.An outside law firm is investigating. Several U.N.C. players are considering transferring. And Hatchell, 67, one of women’s basketball’s most successful and influential coaches and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, is not talking beyond a single written statement.It seems no one, from high-ranking state lawmakers to parents of players, is certain whether she will coach again at U.N.C., a Southern powerhouse of athletics and academics that has spent years grappling with issues of race. Hatchell’s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, could only say, “I hope she does come back.”The allegations against Hatchell, privately detailed to university officials on March 28 and in news media accounts in the week that followed, represent a grave test to her 33-year tenure at U.N.C., where she is under contract for just one more season. And although the just-concluded season was modestly more successful than other recent campaigns, Hatchell has lately led a program that felt removed from the one that, not long ago, routinely won at least 25 games a year.This year, in its first appearance in the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament since the 2014-15 season, U.N.C. (18-15) exited in the first round with a 20-point loss to California.Hatchell’s critics have been reluctant to speak publicly, in part, they said, because they fear retaliation. After so many years, Hatchell has become an institution at U.N.C., not quite on par with Dean Smith, the revered former men’s coach, but not far off. Many current and former players did not respond to messages, but some who did expressed support for Hatchell, even as they depicted her as a coach of searing, drawling intensity.The university said it had hired a Charlotte law firm to “assess the culture of the women’s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.” Officials have declined to comment beyond that.The law firm is expected to examine the quality of medical care for players and whether Hatchell had warned her team that “nooses” would await them if they turned in a poor performance against Louisville. U.N.C. officials were also told that Hatchell had urged her players to perform a “tomahawk chop” war cry to fire them up — a suggestion the women resisted — and that she had described players as “old mules.” Some people perceived the comment as a reference to female slaves.Smith, Hatchell’s lawyer, said the coach “doesn’t have a racist bone in her body.”He said some players had misconstrued Hatchell’s words, but he acknowledged that she had apologized after an internal uproar about the episode in which people recalled that she had referred to nooses.“She said words like, ‘They’re going to hang us out to dry. They’re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,’” Smith said. He added that Hatchell, who did not believe she had said anything improper, initially apologized by saying something like, “I’m sorry you took it that way.”“The team did not see that as an apology,” Smith said. “I think she thought she apologized.”But a furor still built, and the university, whose trustees declined to comment or did not respond to messages, will soon have to decide the fate of the coach, who cultivated the modern women’s game and has been known more for her fiery courtside coaching than personal controversy.“I never encountered any kind of racial slurs or racism,” said Nikki Teasley, a former U.N.C. point guard who went on to a long career in the W.N.B.A. “My experience with Coach Hatchell was very heartfelt, very loving, very kind.”Teasley, who is African-American, said she did not recall any racially improper comments but did say Hatchell was fierce and demanding.“After playing and then becoming a coach myself and then a mother,” she said, “you understand that sometimes things do get overheated, and in the heat of the moment you do say some things.”Hatchell grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small city 20 miles west of Charlotte, and graduated from a public high school that had only recently integrated. Judge Jesse B. Caldwell III, who graduated from Hunter Huss High School a few years ahead of Hatchell, recalled little friction over integration in the area. Basketball, he said, helped bring people together. At nearby Ashley High School, an integrated team won a state championship in 1967.Hatchell’s school did not have a women’s basketball team when she was a student. She began coaching as an undergraduate, and she took control of the North Carolina program, already an emerging incubator of basketball players, in 1986.She became known as a skilled recruiter and drew some of the nation’s top basketball talent to Chapel Hill. Yet to people in and around her program, Hatchell sometimes seemed to be more of a chief executive than a coach. Andrew Calder, a Hatchell deputy since her arrival at U.N.C., was often credited with developing players.“I learned the game through Coach Calder,” Sampson said. “You knew who the head coach was, but hands-on, no, she wasn’t hands-on when I was there.”To a point, the formula worked. Lifted by a 3-point shot as time expired, the Tar Heels won their only women’s basketball title in 1994. Including that season, the Tar Heels have reached the Final Four three times — far less than programs like Connecticut, Tennessee and Notre Dame.At their best, Hatchell’s teams played with an attractive, fast-paced style that relied on fast breaks and smart point-guard play. This season she continued to tout her up-tempo offense.Hatchell’s stature has grown in a state where college basketball is prized. She missed one season, in 2013-14, for cancer treatment, but the next season North Carolina went 26-9 and finished with a No. 9 ranking.Hatchell’s comeback era came as U.N.C. wrestled with an academic fraud scandal that reached into the women’s basketball program. Although the university was not punished, years of bad headlines, investigations and speculation took a toll. Some players cited the scandal when they chose to transfer elsewhere.Hatchell, though, remained and, in 2016, received a contract extension. Last year, she signed a deal with Nike: $150,000 for up to four personal appearances a year until 2028. (The contract ends early if Hatchell leaves as head coach.)Beyond basketball, Hatchell’s Christian faith has long been central to her life and her public persona. More than a decade ago, she started a women’s Bible study in the Chapel Hill area. For the last six years, the teacher has been Rachel-Ruth Wright, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the North Carolina evangelist.“I’ve never heard her say one negative thing about any of her players,” Ms. Wright said. “She’s always positive, always excited. She’s just an encouragement all the time.”The university’s investigation might answer if she went too far in doing so. The Charlotte Observer this week published a scathing editorial about the conduct of college coaches.“Other women’s basketball programs, including Georgia Tech, have fired coaches in recent years for mistreating players,” the paper, among the state’s most widely read, wrote. “If U.N.C. finds abuse from any coach — men’s or women’s — it should do the same.”Weeks ago, Hatchell appeared in high spirits at a commemoration of U.N.C.’s only national title.Hatchell visited a pregame lunch for members of that 1994 championship team, who were later honored on the court.“She hugged me. ‘Glad to see you’ kind of thing,” Sampson said. “Then she was off, because she had to get prepared for the game.”"
"Tex Winter was a highly successful head basketball coach in college, but he was mostly an assistant coach in the pros. To casual fans at N.B.A. games, he was simply the guy with the wavy white hair sitting on the bench in the shadow of one of pro basketball’s most renowned head coaches.But all the while, Winter was refining his legacy — the triangle offense, a scheme emphasizing ball movement and teamwork that he taught to Phil Jackson as his mentor and assistant coach on nine N.B.A. championship teams with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers.“I wasn’t a very good coach and didn’t have a lot of knowledge, and he had a lot of knowledge,” Jackson once said in reflecting on Winter’s advice during Jackson’s early years with the Bulls. “He’s like the mind of the basketball gods.”Winter died on Wednesday in Manhattan, Kan., where he lived. He was 96 and had been largely incapacitated by a stroke he suffered in April 2009. Kansas State University, where he was head coach for 15 seasons in the 1950s and ’60s, announced the death.Winter, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011, spent 60 years in the sport. He played for Southern California as a senior, coached five college teams and had a stint as head coach of the Houston Rockets before reaching the pinnacle of his career, when his offensive blueprints helped propel Jackson’s Bulls to six N.B.A. titles in the 1990s and his Lakers to three consecutive championships, from 2000 to 2002.Jackson won another two championships coaching the Lakers after Winter was no longer his assistant. A Knicks forward in the late 1960s and most of the ?70s, Jackson was hired as their president in 2014 and continued to champion the triangle. But the Knicks had three dismal seasons under him before his departure in June 2017.Winter was a mentor to Jackson on Bulls teams that were led by Michael Jordan and supported by Scottie Pippen; the Lakers teams featured Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. All four would have dominated in any scheme, but Winter took some of the burden off them by insisting that all their teammates become involved in the offense.“I learned so much from Coach Winter,” Jordan said in a statement issued through The Chicago Tribune. “He was a pioneer and a true student of the game of basketball. He was a tireless worker, always focused on details and preparation, and a great teacher.”Winter’s system involved three players — the center down low, another player in a corner and a third one at the top of the 3-point line — forming a triangle on one side of the court with the two remaining players on the opposite side. The players were all spaced 15 to 20 feet apart, preventing defenders from double-teaming the likes of Jordan and Bryant. The scheme called for constant player movement and sharp passing, allowing someone, most often the star scorer, to take advantage of a befuddled defense to get off the best possible shot. It involved numerous options, with new triangles constantly forming.Winter was a purist, emphasizing fundamentals in place of individual moves honed on playgrounds.“This day and age, these players don’t have any idea of team concepts,” he told The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., in 2005, after retiring. “As far as they are concerned, it’s an individual game: ‘Give me the ball and let me go.’ ”Morice Fredrick Winter was born in Wellington, Tex., on Feb. 25, 1922, and grew up in Huntington Park, Calif., where he became known as Tex. After Navy service in World War II he played basketball at U.S.C. in the 1946-47 season for the longtime coach Sam Barry, who emphasized spacing of players, cutting and brisk passes. Winter was also an outstanding collegiate pole-vaulter.After graduating, he drew on Barry’s system to devise the triangle offense while working as an assistant coach at Kansas State. He was later head coach at Marquette, then returned to Kansas State as its head coach from 1953 to 1968, taking the Wildcats to the N.C.A.A. tournament’s Final Four in 1958 and 1964.Winter expounded on his strategy in his 1962 book, “The Triple-Post Offense,” an early name for his system, providing 135 diagrams of plays.He was named the Rockets’ coach in 1971 and remained with them until January 1973. He later coached at the University of Washington, Northwestern and Long Beach State. He had a career record of 453-334 in 30 seasons of college coaching.Winter joined the Bulls as an assistant coach in 1985, but it wasn’t until Jackson became head coach in 1989 that he was able to fully put his triangle system in place with them.Winter is survived by his wife, Nancy; his sons, Chris, Brian and Russ; and three grandchildren.Bryant recalled a moment attesting to Winter’s zeal for basketball as he felt it should be played.“After we won our second championship,” Bryant remembered, “he came in here right before we had a parade. We were all sitting around, and he talked about us not making fundamentally correct chest passes. He was serious. We all started laughing, and he couldn’t understand why. That’s just Tex.”"
"Good morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)This year the best college basketball team from California is not U.C.L.A.; it is not Stanford, or San Diego State.No, this year, the best college basketball team from California might just be the University of California, Irvine.Yes, you read that right. The Anteaters. (Zot! Zot! Zot!)“We’re one of the top teams on the West Coast, and we have proven we’re probably the best team in California,” Ryan Badrtalei, an assistant coach at U.C. Irvine, said in a telephone interview on Monday.Of course, claims like these are hotly debated at this time of year. But on Sunday, the N.C.A.A. selection committee announced the 68 teams that will play in the Division I men’s basketball tournament, and only two of them were from California: U.C. Irvine and Saint Mary’s, which earned its bid by winning the West Coast Conference tournament.Badrtalei certainly has a case. U.C. Irvine beat Saint Mary’s this season on its way to a 30-5 record, good enough to earn the team a No. 13 seed in the South Region of the N.C.A.A. tournament. U.C. Irvine will play Kansas State on Friday in San Jose.The No. 13 seed means the Anteaters are an underdog in that game. But the team has also been a trendy upset pick among experts, some of whom think the team could make something of a Cinderella run.“The Anteaters are a terrible draw for Kansas State, and their upset odds are two times better than you would expect for a typical No. 13 seed,” The Washington Post’s Neil Greenberg wrote Sunday after the bracket was unveiled. Badrtalei said this year’s team features several upperclassmen who have helped them beat squads like Texas A&M and Saint Mary’s on the road — wins that give the Anteaters confidence that they can hang with stiff competition.Veteran players like Jonathan Galloway, who is a first team all-conference selection, has helped anchor the Anteaters defensively. The team prides itself on rebounding well and being a “a real stubborn defensive team,” Badrtalei said, adding that Kansas State plays a similar style.“We’re going to have to go out and play really well,” Badrtalei said of Friday’s matchup. “But these guys know their roles. They know what they’re doing. We purposely recruit guys who have a chip on their shoulders. We like that. We like being in the position where we have to perform.”So can they pull off the upset?Said Badrtalei: “There’s not a question in our minds.”(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)• Kevin Tsujihara, the chief executive of Warner Bros. studios division, has stepped down after accusations surfaced that he had pushed for a woman with whom he had a sexual relationship to be considered for roles in the company.

"A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday sentenced three men in a college basketball fraud case to between six and nine months in prison, lenient sentences that the judge said were nonetheless important to deter the funneling of money to the families of college basketball prospects — an N.C.A.A. violation that a jury found last year also constituted a felony.The sentences come ahead of a second trial next month at which more may be revealed about how widespread the rot in recruiting has spread.James Gatto, the former head of global basketball marketing at Adidas, was sentenced to nine months by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Merl Code Jr., another former Adidas employee, and Christian Dawkins, an aspiring agent, were given six months each. Code and Dawkins, who are also defendants in next month’s trial, were ordered to pay restitution of a little more than $28,000 each, with Gatto’s amount of restitution still to be determined.Kaplan ruled that the punishments would not go into effect until the appeal process is completed. The defendants have two weeks to ask the federal circuit court to re-examine the case.A jury convicted the three men last fall of defrauding the University of Louisville and, in Gatto’s case, also North Carolina State University and the University of Kansas. The men participated in a scheme in which the families of highly rated men’s basketball recruits were offered money in exchange for pledges to play for one of those teams, which are sponsored by Adidas. Prosecutors argued that by unknowingly making the universities vulnerable to N.C.A.A. sanctions, the defendants had victimized the schools.Such offers are barred by N.C.A.A. rules, which require that college athletes adhere to the association’s policy of amateurism and not be compensated for their participation in their sport beyond a scholarship and related costs of attendance.Repercussions from the charges brought by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York have already included the firing of a Hall of Fame coach — Rick Pitino, formerly of Louisville, who denies wrongdoing and whom prosecutors did not charge. A Kansas player was ruled ineligible early this year after his connection to the scheme came to light.The lawyers for Code and Dawkins welcomed the sentence.“Happy might be the wrong word, but the judge granted a lenient sentence,” said Steve Haney, who represents Dawkins.Haney also promised that the second trial, which involves alleged bribes to assistant coaches at top men’s basketball programs, would not only exonerate Dawkins but would also show how college basketball business is really done.“We’re going to pull back the covers,” he said, adding, “This could transform college basketball and put the players in a situation moving forward so they and their labor are treated fairly.”Haney pledged to put coaches on the stand — “as many as I can get into the courtroom.”Robert S. Khuzami, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in this case, said in a statement, “The sentences imposed today only begin to reflect the magnitude of the harm these defendants caused through a scheme that not only defrauded multiple public universities but upended the lives of young student-athletes and corrupted a game cherished by so many.”Tuesday’s sentencing hearing in a packed courtroom on a high floor of the federal district building in downtown Manhattan saw all three defendants as well as their lawyers address the court and plead for leniency. They requested no jail time at all. While most of these statements referred to the defendants’ personal characters, some of the attorneys also pointed to the unusual nature of the case, which depended on a theory in which the universities were victimized by the defendants’ attempts to secure them top talent (albeit while putting them at risk of N.C.A.A. penalties).“If he thought that anyone would conceive what he did here as a crime, he would never have done it,” Code’s lawyer, Mark Moore, said of his client.Comparing the situation in the case to a legal principle called the “doctrine of unclean hands,” Moore suggested that widespread illicit activity in college recruiting called into question who was truly responsible for the harm his client had purportedly caused.“Adidas has financial contracts with Louisville through which Louisville profited,” Moore said.“You have not seen Louisville or any of these schools look to get out of their contracts with Adidas” since the scandal broke in 2017, he added.Moore noted that although it was not admitted into the record before the jury, Kaplan seemed to recall an earlier scandal at Louisville in which a basketball staffer paid strippers and prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in on-campus housing.Indeed, Kaplan himself appeared to raise so-called Strippergate, which resulted in N.C.A.A. penalties, during the prosecutor Edward B. Diskant’s statement to the court, in which Diskant insisted that the universities were the victims.Kaplan said that the defendants had committed “a serious crime,” one whose purportedly common nature was not by itself exonerating: “The ‘everybody’s doing it’ argument, in short, is not a Get Out of Jail Free card,” he said.But the judge also recognized that the alleged behavior of university employees like assistant coaches and, perhaps, the interests of the universities themselves complicated the theory of the case — on which a jury convicted — that the universities were victims.Referring to Brian “Tugs” Bowen Jr., a prospect whose father testified that he had indirectly taken from Adidas in exchange for Bowen’s commitment to Louisville, Kaplan said, “To me, probably the worst, the most seriously injured victim of the Louisville scheme was Tug Bowen.” (Bowen was declared ineligible and is now playing professionally in Australia.)On wiretaps, defendants made oblique references to their activity being typical of high-profile men’s college basketball. They also suggested that at least one of Adidas’s rivals were involved in similar schemes, though there have been no further charges.Last year Yahoo Sports revealed documents that purported to show the families of several former stars who went on to play for many of the top college basketball programs were on the payroll of Dawkins, the aspiring agent.The second case, scheduled to be tried next month, initially featured as defendants three former assistant coaches at major programs along with Dawkins and a money manager. The money manager, Munish Sood, reached a deal with prosecutors before the last trial and served as their witness. The three former assistants all pleaded guilty in January, after the guilty verdict in the first case.A third case, whose trial is scheduled for later thus year, features the former Auburn assistant Chuck Person, who has been charged with bribery."
"The N.B.A. coaches Steve Kerr and Nate McMillan and the college coach Jay Wright have been chosen as U.S.A. Basketball assistant coaches under the national team’s new head coach, Gregg Popovich, according to two people familiar with U.S.A.B.’s selections.Golden State’s Kerr, Indiana’s McMillan and Villanova’s Wright will bring significant experience — and a measure of star power — to Popovich’s bench in their roles as assistants for the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China as well as the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the appointments publicly.The United States hasn’t formally qualified for the 2019 World Cup but is in a strong position. Led by its qualifying coach, Jeff Van Gundy, and featuring a rotating roster of players primarily from the N.B.A.’s G League, Team U.S.A. is 7-1 with just four qualifiers remaining. One or two more wins should clinch a spot in China.Popovich, entering his 22nd full season as coach of the San Antonio Spurs, is succeeding Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski as head coach of the men’s senior national team after Krzyzewski’s wildly successful run from 2006-16, with a record of 88-1. Team U.S.A. won five major championships under Krzyzewski: Olympic gold in 2008, 2012 and 2016 and FIBA World Cup titles in 2010 and 2014.Kerr, 53, has been close to Popovich since he played for him in San Antonio. Kerr has won three championships in his first four seasons as head coach of the Warriors.McMillan, 54, was a U.S.A.B. assistant under Krzyzewski from 2006 to 2012 and led the Pacers to a 48-34 record last season that made Indiana the surprise of the Eastern Conference.Wright, 56, has coached Villanova to two national championships in the past three seasons, establishing himself as the hottest coach in the college game."

(Watch live on NASA’s website.)One of the two astronauts, Christina Koch, was originally paired with Anne McClain for what was supposed to be the first all-female spacewalk. It was canceled after Ms. McClain found that the available spacesuit was too roomy, a safety issue that raised questions of sexism.That made us think about the media coverage of women in space.

"When the left sneaker of college basketball’s biggest star split open on national television Wednesday night 30 seconds into the biggest game of the season, what spilled out was not only his foot but also questions about the future of a marquee player and about the huge influence shoe companies hold over big-time college basketball.The episode occurred in a game between the archrivals Duke and North Carolina. Zion Williamson, a Duke freshman, pivoted with the ball above the foul line, and the sheer force of his 285-pound frame and acrobatic versatility appeared to cut the shoe almost in two, as though severed by a sharp knife.Former President Barack Obama, sitting on the sidelines at the Duke arena, was seen on video pointing at Williamson and appearing to say, “His shoe broke.”As the scene was replayed on countless highlight shows on Thursday, the damaged shoe threatened to become a nightmare for Nike, which pays tens of millions to elite college sports programs to be the exclusive sponsor for teams and supplier of their footwear.With his shoe split and his knee sprained, Williamson, an unpaid, budding superstar, sat helpless on the arena floor, staring at the shoe he was wearing in part because of a rich deal between Nike and Duke, one of the world’s wealthiest universities.Here were all the issues of big-time college sports laid bare: Should amateurism be curbed in college sports, allowing athletes a cut of the money they help produce? Should a prodigious talent like Williamson, who is good enough to play professionally right now, have to risk his future competing for free because of an N.B.A. rule prohibiting him from leaping to the league from high school? Do the sneaker companies, which were at the heart of a federal fraud trial near the start of the season, do more harm than good in college sports?For a quarter of a century, Nike has been paying Duke tens of millions of dollars to sponsor its teams, and to ensure that its athletes wear only footwear bearing the company’s ubiquitous logo. The players receive enough shoes to carry them through the season, allowing them to serve largely as free human billboards.“All this does,” Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane’s sports law program, said of Williamson’s injury, “is put a magnifying glass on an issue that has existed for a long time.”Williamson has not commented.Nike stock closed down Thursday by 1.05 percent, as the world wondered how a sneaker could split so badly in the middle of a game.The answer remains a puzzle even to experts. James Gilbert, an orthopedic surgeon who worked with Duke athletics in the 1990s, said he had seen shoes fall apart similarly on soccer players, but never on the hardwood.“I think it’s a product failure,” Gilbert said. “I’ve never seen that. I had no idea that that happens.”In a statement Wednesday night, Nike said: “We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery. The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.” The statement called the shoe explosion “an isolated occurrence,” though in 2015, the Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon even as the insoles of his Nike shoes slipped out of place.Williamson, who has a mild knee sprain, will probably be sidelined for one to two weeks, and then continue being the favorite to become the No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft in June. By then, he will probably already be a millionaire, because of the endorsement deals he can sign when he ends his college career. For now, he is an N.C.A.A. amateur.Sneaker companies first became deeply involved with college athletics in the late 1970s, when an enterprising Nike executive, Sonny Vaccaro, arranged for several prominent coaches, such as John Thompson of Georgetown and Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada-Las Vegas, to receive money in exchange for outfitting their players in the company’s shoes. Starting in the late 1980s, Nike began to sign deals that covered all of a university’s teams.“Now we see the kids wearing the shoes and selling the product all over the world — and the kids never got anything,” Vaccaro, who left Nike years ago, said Thursday. “The money has served the same people, except for the most important ones.”A decision in a federal class-action lawsuit challenging N.C.A.A. restrictions on compensation is expected any day.Standout basketball players were squeezed further in 2006, when the N.B.A. barred talented teenagers from following in the footsteps of Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James by entering the league straight out of high school.Then, in September 2017, federal prosecutors in New York’s Southern District revealed more of the chasm between college basketball players, who can receive only scholarships and related costs of being on campus, and the administrators and coaches who reap the benefits of the revenue the athletes generate for their colleges, conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. The men’s basketball tournament yields about $1 billion a year for the television rights.In three complaints filed in United States District Court in New York, prosecutors accused roughly a dozen assistant coaches, middlemen and employees of Adidas of plotting to funnel money to players’ families in exchange for pledges that the athletes, among other things, would play for certain universities and sign with Adidas once they began their pro careers. The scandal led to the firing of a Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino of the University of Louisville, and has netted three convictions, including of Adidas’s former director of global sports marketing.The transactions outlined by the complaints are practically the modus operandi at many top basketball programs, documents and testimony in the legal case suggested. Wiretaps revealed suspects describing at least one Adidas rival engaging in similar practices. Documents from the case reported by Yahoo Sports last year indicated that former top players at dozens of prominent programs — including Duke — had been on the payroll of an aspiring agent who has since been convicted of fraud.Duke did not reply to requests for comment Thursday.The specifics of Duke’s deal with Nike, which the two sides have extended through 2027, are not publicly known. As a private university, Duke is not obligated to reveal the terms.But a look at Nike deals with similar universities that are public offer some indication of how the contracts work.Nike’s deal with North Carolina, for instance, will give the university more than $90 million in cash and merchandise over 10 years. Nike also signed personal contracts with a number of North Carolina coaches: Roy Williams, the men’s basketball coach, will receive an average of $300,000 a year over the life of the 10-year agreement.Contracts generally state that Nike is not liable for injuries suffered by athletes wearing its products. The contracts also require every player to wear the company’s shoes unless a medical condition makes Nike footwear unsuitable. A player might, as stipulated in Nike’s deal with the University of Michigan, be required to make himself available for examination by Nike or a local podiatrist before using a shoe made by another company.It is not known why Williamson wore the particular Nike model that tore on Wednesday. It was a Nike “signature shoe,” a term for a style endorsed by a specific athlete — in this case, the N.B.A. star Paul George, who plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder.What makes Williamson so compelling is the same thing that might make a shoe unable to contain him. He combines size and speed with strength and agility in the manner of James, who during a day off this month went to Charlottesville, Va., to see Williamson and the Blue Devils take on Virginia. Though Williamson weighs 285 pounds, at times he seems like the fastest player on the court.“When you’re dealing with some of these athletes who are getting quicker, stronger, faster, you’ve got to consider some of that,” said Gilbert, the orthopedist."
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Mr. Trump said on Thursday that the U.S. should recognize Israel’s authority over the long disputed Golan Heights, overturning decades of American policy in the Middle East.Mr. Trump’s announcement on Twitter came after persistent pressure from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally who is fighting for his political life with an election scheduled for next month. While popular in Israel and among some U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Trump’s decision is likely to be condemned almost everywhere else. Catch up: The United Nations has rejected Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights since 1967, when Israeli troops seized the 400 square miles from Syria during the Arab-Israeli War. Here’s a brief history of the dispute. What’s next: Practically speaking, Mr. Trump’s announcement doesn’t change much, as the status of the Golan Heights is not under negotiation, and there’s no expectation that Israel will withdraw. But symbolically, the decision shakes up a debate that has changed little since the 1970s.European Union officials agreed on Thursday to extend the deadline for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc until May 22, as long as Prime Minister Theresa May can persuade Parliament to accept her plan for doing so. If she can’t — and lawmakers have already rejected her proposal twice — the deadline would be moved up to April 12.The agreement effectively averted a disorderly and chaotic departure at the end of next week, yet such a break remains a possibility.What’s next: Neither side wants Britain to leave without a deal. European Union officials said they remained open to a longer delay but that it would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections — something that Mrs. May has said would be an absurdity.A week after the terrorist attack on two mosques that left 50 people dead, mourners from around the world gathered in Christchurch, New Zealand, today to share the Muslim call to prayer and two minutes of silence.“This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart — but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,” said Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor Mosque, one of the two attacked.Related: In addition to announcing a ban on the type of weapons used in the shooting, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has pledged to hold social media companies accountable for letting hateful speech thrive on their platforms. As of Thursday, at least two people have been charged in New Zealand with spreading the killer’s video of part of the attack.The Daily: Today’s episode is about the speed with which New Zealand planned changes to its gun laws after the attack.The country’s national airline said today that it had asked to cancel an order of 737 Max 8 jets. It is the first publicly confirmed attempt to stop a deal since the planes were involved in two deadly crashes. A spokesman for the carrier, Garuda Indonesia, said that its passengers had lost confidence in the model. But he acknowledged that it would be difficult to cancel a signed agreement.Garuda’s deal was for 49 planes, and estimated to be worth $4.9 billion. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.Another angle: Relatives of those killed when another airline’s Max 8 crashed in Indonesia say the airline tried to buy their silence with a deal that would also protect Boeing.Small countries, corporations and wealthy individuals have a new weapon at their disposal: privatized spying through companies that hire former intelligence operatives.

But the phrase is also used metaphorically to refer to a character-defining political issue, and it has been popping up in coverage of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.The chemical test, in use since the Middle Ages, employs a dye derived from lichens to determine whether a solution is more acidic or alkaline.The political application of the phrase appeared in The Times at least as early as 1950, when it described NATO and the Marshall Plan as “the litmus test for distinguishing between Communists and supporters of the United States.”This year, “litmus test” has appeared in The Times to refer to marijuana legalization, the proposed border wall and universal health care."
"He was a sixth-grader from Seattle, a 13-year-old elite basketball prospect with arms that seemed endless. He stared straight into the camera for a photo shoot as his uniform shorts drooped toward his calves. Just 5-foot-5 and 110 pounds, he stood tall, self-assured.So what became of the boy who patterned his daily drills off the childhood workouts of Pete Maravich? Whose routine included making 500 baskets a day? Who crisscrossed the country, courted by A.A.U. teams, all-star tournaments, shoe companies, high school and college coaches? Is he still in the game?As Knicks rookie Allonzo Trier clicked through the photos on a reporter’s laptop, his eyes softened. It’s been nine years since that photo shoot landed him on the cover of The New York Times Magazine. “I haven’t seen these in a really long time,” he said. “It’s where I came from. It’s crazy to see.”Trier, now 22 years old, 6-foot-5 and 200 pounds, has been one of the N.B.A.’s biggest surprises. Undrafted out of Arizona, his rising star seemed stuck in orbit, kept adrift because of injuries and a case, successfully appealed, acusing him of using a performance-enhancing drug.In the Knicks’ season-opener Oct. 17 against Atlanta at Madison Square Garden, an audacious dunk over just about everyone on the court announced his arrival.“We went crazy when he dunked that one,” said Golden State forward Kevin Durant, who was watching at home with friends. Durant knows Trier from his rookie season with the Seattle SuperSonics, before the franchise moved to Oklahoma City. “We’re so happy for Zo. We’ve seen Zo grow up. We had a little hand in raising him, a little hand. So it feels good for him to have this success. He’s a pure baller.”Trier’s journey from middle school prospect to the pros is an allegory, for better or for worse, of these basketball times. After establishing himself as one of the best in A.A.U. basketball, he played for four different high schools, in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Rockville, Md. and Las Vegas, the quintessential free agent in the world of elite high school basketball.He was one of the most coveted recruits in the country and a finalist for the 2015 Naismith Boy’s High School Player of the Year before he signed with Arizona. Plans to be one-and-done and off to N.B.A. riches changed after he broke a bone in his shooting hand. The Pac-12 All-Freshman team selection returned for his sophomore year.A few weeks before his second season, a car accident sent Trier to the hospital. After sustaining a back injury, Trier said he unknowingly took what turned out to be a banned steroid alternative called ostarine. Related suspensions and appeals consumed much of his second season, and a small portion of his third.Then Arizona became a focal point in a wide-ranging corruption investigation by the F.B.I. and Trier declared for the 2018 N.B.A. draft. He worked out for 18 teams, but questions about performance-enhancing drugs lingered; some teams also were concerned about his willingness to share the ball. The Knicks wanted to draft Trier in the second round, but when the 7-foot-1 center Mitchell Robinson was still available, the team went with the bigger need at the 36th pick. The draft ended without Trier’s name being called.“He was devastated,” Marcie Trier, his mother, said. “It was painful to go through that, but sometimes pain can turn into something beautiful.”Trier and his mother watched the draft in the Los Angeles office of the agent James Dunleavy and Joe Dumars, the former N.B.A. player and executive who is now president of basketball for the Independent Sports & Entertainment agency.“Never forget this,” Dumars told Trier. “Use it.”Later that night, after Trier agreed to a contract with New York that would split his playing time between the Knicks and the team’s development league affiliate in Westchester, General Manager Scott Perry called.“You could hear the disappointment in his voice,” Perry said.Trier told Perry: “There were not 60 players who were better than me, let alone 20 players who were better than me.”The next day, Trier found a high school gym in Los Angeles and got back to work.“He has aspirations to become a great basketball player,” Perry said. “With his work ethic, coupled with the slight from the entire N.B.A. and a chip on his shoulder, he’s using that in a powerful way.”Per the terms of Trier’s two-way contract, he is allowed to spend 45 days with the Knicks. Before that period expires in early December, the Knicks could renegotiate his deal and create a roster spot.It’s safe to assume that Trier won’t be playing any of his games off the Saw Mill River Parkway. After his debut, Trier’s dunks, slicing passes and chase-down blocks have quickly made him a fan favorite. He became the first Knick rookie to post at least 15 points in his first two career games at the Garden since Willis Reed. He averaged 17.3 points over the first week this month and has repeatedly earned praise for his toughness and poise.After Washington point guard John Wall knocked him down in a game during that stretch, a verbal confrontation led to technical fouls. At one point, Trier forced Wall to fumble the ball in front of the Knicks bench. Coach David Fizdale loved it, celebrating the move with a raucous hand slap.“That’s Knicks DNA,” Fizdale said after the game. “One of those things we liked about Allonzo, he was one of those types of guys that didn’t back down from anybody.”Fizdale has already put the ball in Trier’s hands in game-deciding moments, given his ability to create his shot in isolation. “They call him Iso Zo,” Fizdale said. “I’m going to let the kid be who he is. The kid really puts in a lot of time, maybe the most on the team. He really is a competitor. He fears nothing. He’s starting to show that it’s rational to think that way.”Against Chicago last week, Trier made his first career start thanks to injury keeping Tim Hardaway Jr. out of the lineup. Trier ended up with a chance to put the game away twice in the final seconds but fell short as the Knicks lost in double overtime.Afterward, with a blue towel hanging from his shoulders, he sat in his locker and spoke in clichés. “It’s a tough one to take on the chin,” Trier said.“Late in the fourth were you starting to think maybe this moment is too big for me?” a reporter asked.Trier looked up. His eyebrows arched.“For me?” he asked. “Nah.”“Not at all?” the reporter continued.“Not at all,” Trier said."
"MELBOURNE, Australia — As Mason Cox sprinted toward the football, one thought ran through his mind: attack it.He leapt up onto the back of the defender in front of him, using him as a stepladder to bring himself closer to the dropping ball. He timed his leap to perfection, turning his 6-foot-11 body into a long crane, and plucked the yellow, oval-shaped ball out of the night sky.It was a clean and pivotal mark, or catch, 25 meters (27 yards) out from goal in an Australian rules football match. Cox would finish that game with eight contested marks — the second-highest ever in an Australian Football League playoff game — and three goals. His team, Collingwood Football Club of Melbourne, won that playoff game but lost in the grand final — Australia’s Super Bowl — the next week.Yet Cox stood out for another reason: He is an American, from Highland Village north of Dallas. In the last five years, a handful of Americans, generally tall men performing a specialized role, have been contracted by A.F.L. clubs. By the beginning of the 2018 season in March, Cox was the only one still left in the league.He has become a bit of a sensation in Australia, a fan favorite whose goals are often met with chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” He has been welcomed in part because Australians would love to see more global recognition for their homegrown sport. He has also shown a playful embrace of the country, wearing a “Crocodile Dundee” outfit to a team party and joking on Instagram, “I think I qualify for citizenship now.” (Cox intends on beginning the process of becoming an Australian citizen in December.)“Footy’s something I take very seriously in my life,” Cox said in an interview, using the Australian nickname for the sport. “I put a lot of effort and time into it and it’s something that this city is so crazy for. You can’t get away from it sometimes, because you go down the street and people want to talk about the last game you played.”With the exception of Irishmen — Gaelic football is similar to Australian rules football — foreigners are a rare sight in the A.F.L.But Cox, 27, who now speaks with a healthy dose of Australian accent, could be the perfect brand builder, giving international cachet to a domestic sport that began as a means of keeping cricketers fit during their off-season in the winter.The A.F.L. has long craved international expansion and recognition — the league started playing an international rules series against Ireland in 1984 and, in the past decade, it has played exhibition games in Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and London.Still, Cox may well be the last American to make it in the A.F.L. In March, the league announced that it would be shelving its combine in the United States — which it had been holding annually since 2012 — for at least a year as it made Ireland the priority in its search for international talent.An earlier edition of that combine changed Cox’s life.In the spring of 2014, a few months before graduating from Oklahoma State University, where he walked onto the basketball team, he received an invitation to attend a combine for the A.F.L. in Los Angeles. He had never heard of the league.But the league had a shortage of people capable of performing the specialized role of ruckman/center-half-forward, which requires someone at least 6 feet 6 inches tall, mobile, athletic and well coordinated with both their hands and their feet.In an island nation of about 25 million people, there just aren’t many who fit that bill. But there are plenty of American college basketball players who do.Cox was one of them, and he killed it at the combine.After a visit with several teams in Australia, he received four contract offers. Cox had already accepted a job as an engineer with Exxon Mobil in Houston, figuring his athletic career was over, but backed out of it to sign with Collingwood in Melbourne in 2014.Upon arriving at the football club in late August 2014, he and Craig McRae, the club’s then head of development, went to work. “We just got into the everyday grind of getting it all done and really locked into it,” Cox recalled with a smile.Initially, like many a novice, Cox dropped the Australian football onto his foot with two hands. This was problematic, McRae explained, because “the ball’s going to be dropped — particularly a 7-foot guy — the ball’s going to be dropped from a long way above the ground, so then there’s so much room for error.”Therefore, “our game requires you to guide the ball” onto the boot with “one hand.”Cox’s progression was rapid. Less than two weeks after he first picked up an A.F.L. ball at Collingwood’s facility, he hit McRae in stride with a laces-out, 45-meter, or 49-yard, low drop punt.Four weeks later, Cox was consistently dropping the ball onto his foot with a one-handed guide.For the specialized skill of contested marking, or catching the ball in a crowd, McRae took Cox to see Anthony Rocca, Collingwood’s then development coach, once a week. “His hands were really clean,” McRae recalled, taking note of Cox’s big hands. “He just wouldn’t fumble.”By the end of his three-month, intensive course in Australian rules football with McRae and Rocca, Cox was able to join the rest of Collingwood’s professional footballers in preseason training. He then played for Collingwood’s minor league team for just over a season before making his big league debut in April 2016.He scored a goal with his very first kick. By the beginning of this season’s finals — the Australian term for playoffs — he had firmly established himself as a solid role player.But Cox’s breakout performance in the preliminary final two weeks ago suggested that he might be on the cusp of becoming a transcendent star. His strong performance — two goals and a deft assist — in Collingwood’s nail-biting grand final loss to the West Coast Eagles a week later reinforced that tantalizing notion.Rocca, who still coaches Cox, believes that the American has only just started scratching the surface of his enormous potential, saying that his scope for future improvement “is absolutely huge.”Cox has embraced Australia’s culture, values, lifestyle and even language. He said that he especially likes Melbourne, his adopted hometown.“Something that I’ve loved since I’ve been here is it’s a multicultural melting pot,” he said.He eats pho on Victoria Street; he enjoys Greek and Italian food and culture in Melbourne’s northern suburbs; and he has befriended people from many different ethnic backgrounds: His best friends include a Vietnamese-Australian whose family came to Australia as refugees, a Filipino-Australian and a recently arrived Swede.Cox’s speech is peppered with Australian vernacular. He speaks of “university,” not “college,” and expresses his full agreement with something another person says with the ubiquitous Australianism “a hundred percent.”And he has picked up a distinct Australian accent. Even his family has noticed. “When he gets home, we put him right back into place very quickly,” his oldest brother Nolan said, with a laugh."
"Alabama has hired Nate Oats as the university's new coach, the school announced Wednesday.Oats, 44, guided Buffalo to a program-best 32-4 mark this season. He recorded a victory in each of the past two NCAA Tournaments while going 96-43 in four seasons at the school.Oats replaces Avery Johnson, who was let go with a 75-62 record after four seasons with the Crimson Tide. Oats will try to elevate a program that has reached the NCAA tourney just twice in the past 13 seasons. The Crimson Tide went 18-16 this season.Less than two weeks ago, Oats agreed to an extension to stay at Buffalo through the 2023-24 season. However, while Alabama was announcing Oats had been hired, the Bulls were confirming they accepted his resignation and said associate head coach Jim Whitesell would serve as interim coach while the school conducts its search.--UNLV hired T.J. Otzelberger from South Dakota State as its coach.Otzelberger went 70-33 in three seasons with the Jackrabbits, leading the team to the NCAA Tournament in 2017 and 2018.

"THE FALCONER By Dana Czapnik 278 pp. Atria Books. $25.Toward the end of “The Falconer,” Dana Czapnik’s electric debut novel, 17-year-old Lucy Adler looks up from Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex” at the Japanese maple on her Upper West Side neighbor’s terrace. It’s difficult to read the passage and not think of beloved Francie Nolan peering out another window in another New York City borough, almost 100 years earlier. Yet whereas in “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” both Francie and the Tree of Heaven grow up amid an unforgiving, concrete urban setting, Czapnik’s maple has been coaxed and cared for, its leaves treated with a protective coating. Lucy, a middle-class Manhattanite attending an elite private school, has battled none of the Nolan family’s hardships, nor is she plagued by the acerbic ennui that Holden Caulfield gave voice to in “The Catcher in the Rye,” but comparisons to both classic New York bildungsromans nonetheless seem inevitable. That is, until you realize that what binds them — all tell of a determinedly independent young hero’s quest for selfhood catalyzed by the crucible of New York City — is also what makes them so resistant to comparison. Like Francie and Holden before her, Lucy, a street-smart, superlative basketballer vulnerable to the perils of approaching womanhood, is too carefully drawn to be equated with anyone else.Lucy’s fierce first-person point of view is as confident and fearless as she is on the court; she narrates her story with the immediacy and sharpness of a sports commentator, mixed with the pathos and wisdom of a perceptive adolescent charting the perils of her senior year of high school. A self-described “pizza bagel — a Jewish and Italian mutt-girl,” Lucy grapples with the rigid expectations of others, especially her harshly critical high school peers who have rendered her an outcast. “Isn’t it just so much easier for everybody when a girl fits into a nice little girl category — good girl slut tomboy girly girl smart girl ditz — instead of being a fully fleshed-out person who is in constant conversation … with all the various fractious parts of herself,” Lucy wisely observes. We watch that conversation unfold in real time through her adventures with her best friend, Alexis, a tough-talking Dominican sage tethered to Lucy through basketball and their shared outsider status; Lucy’s forays into the navel-gazing Downtown arts scene of her painter cousin, Violet; and, most pulverizing, her unrequited love for her emotionally unavailable scrimmage partner Percy, a self-proclaimed nihilist from a neglected but moneyed family who goes through girlfriends like Kleenex and is referred to by friends as the “Virgin Surgeon.”But it’s arguably the nonhuman characters that give true shape to Lucy’s evolution: basketball and New York. (The novel’s opening line, “The ball is a face,” confirms the game’s significance and anthropomorphism for her.) Only with ball in hand does Lucy feel invincible and most herself, even as that self changes: “I ought not to imbue a ball with so much magic, but when I’m holding one I go from Lucy Adler, invisible girl … to Lucy Adler, Warrior Goddess.” Her self-descriptions on the court are as visceral and vivid as any sex scene, and when the actual sex scene does eventually unfold it is against the backdrop of a Rangers game on television, the commentators’ play-by-play mirroring Lucy’s own disembodied narration of her experience.The basketball grows into a metaphor for the universe: “I bounce the world hard on the blacktop, and it comes back into my hand covered with a fine layer of New York City diamond dust.” The entire novel is indeed cloaked in just such a glimmering film, and Lucy’s love-hate relationship with her roiling city reflects her changeable hopes for herself and others. “I guess New York is like that, in that what you mistake it for matters as much as what it actually is.” Czapnik, who herself grew up in Manhattan around the same time as Lucy, captures nostalgia — for both a vanishing New York and Lucy’s evaporating childhood — with the lucidity of a V.R. headset. The early-90s era seems unremarkable to the characters in the thick of it — “We live in … insignificant times,” Lucy says between hits of a joint — but feels poignantly pre-9/11 to today’s reader.Lucy’s coming-of-age is tempered by her constant brush-ups against the constrictions society places on her sex. Happening upon “The Falconer,” a bronze of a boy in Elizabethan dress releasing a falcon in Central Park, Lucy is envious that statues of boys depict them in action poses while women are either demure nudes or Alice in Wonderland. “Don’t you wish they made statues of girls like that?” Lucy asks Alexis. “Just some girl having unapologetic fun.” Alexis replies: “I never apologize for the fun I have. And neither do you.” Reader, beware: Spending time with Lucy is unapologetic fun, and heartbreak, and awe as well."
"A jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts against two former Adidas employees and an aspiring sports agent in Manhattan federal court Wednesday after more than two days’ deliberation, concluding that it constituted fraud for the defendants to funnel money to the families of college basketball recruits in exchange for the prospects’ commitment to teams sponsored by Adidas.James Gatto, Adidas’s former head of global basketball marketing; Merl Code Jr., another former Adidas employee; and an aspiring agent named Christian Dawkins were found guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, after a three-week trial.The three men could face several years in prison. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan set sentencing for March 5, just before the start of N.C.A.A. basketball’s postseason. But the larger question is whether the verdicts will have any effect on what is still widely considered business as usual in college basketball.Current and former college sports officials say basketball operators likely are still connecting families of valuable prospects with money in violation of N.C.A.A. amateurism rules. However, some operators may be chilled by the fact that, as of Wednesday, three people involved in such a scheme have been convicted of federal crimes.Gatto’s attorney indicated afterward that his client would appeal.The allegations, first revealed in September 2017, laid bare what many had long assumed or known about college basketball at its highest levels: that its top players — who for a decade have been required to wait at least a year after high school before entering the N.B.A., and who are prohibited by N.C.A.A. rules from accepting payment beyond scholarships and related costs — were getting money under the table via a murky underworld of agents, “runners” and other interested parties.The charges in this case also further exposed the outsize influence of the major basketball apparel companies — Nike, Adidas and Under Armour — on college sports. They invest millions of dollars establishing a pipeline of loyalists that begins with their own pre-college “grass-roots” leagues, runs through college teams they sponsor and culminates in star players whom they sign to endorse their clothes, gear and sneakers.In this case, federal prosecutors said that the defendants had funneled money from Adidas to prospects who wound up at three teams sponsored by the sneaker giant: Louisville, Kansas and North Carolina State.These schools, prosecutors asserted, were victims, since they were unwittingly playing ineligible athletes, risking N.C.A.A. penalties.“As a jury has now found,” said Robert S. Khuzami, the Deputy United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, “the defendants not only deceived universities into issuing scholarships under false pretenses, they deprived the universities of their economic rights and tarnished an ideal which makes college sports a beloved tradition by so many fans all over the world.”In a statement, Adidas said it had “strengthened our internal processes and controls and remain committed to ethical and fair business practices.”Though the verdicts’ larger impact on college basketball was not immediately clear, after Wednesday the following may be safely said: There is precedent that cheating N.C.A.A. bylaws can have consequences beyond collegiate infractions.“Now you don’t just have to worry about what the N.C.A.A. does to you — you have to worry about going to jail,” said Dan Beebe, a former Big 12 commissioner who consults with conferences.There are still two other trials stemming from the charges to come, involving four assistant coaches from different major programs who were accused of plotting to direct players to various managers, including Dawkins, in exchange for kickbacks.The basketball establishment has already started reacting to the charges. An N.C.A.A. commission convened to reform the sport, chaired by Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, had its proposals implemented a couple months ago.At the same time, the college sports establishment has indicated no movement toward reforming the economic system that appeared to prompt the scheme: multimillion-dollar apparel sponsorships; huge financial incentives to win big; and amateurism rules that bar paying players.The scandal eventually may lead to the end of the N.B.A.’s “one-and-done” rule, which currently bars players from entering the draft until one year after their high school class’ graduation. Last week, the N.B.A. announced a new program in its development league designed to encourage the best would-be freshmen to skip college and instead enter the G League and train for a year while receiving a $125,000 salary.The N.C.A.A. is also expected to, at some point, investigate the schools involved for violations. Prosecutors had asked the organization to hold off on such probes as long as their own process was still playing out.Wednesday’s news also demonstrated that universities may be considered victims of fraud in a legal sense even when their employees, such as assistant coaches, are in on the schemes. There was testimony, for instance, that suggested that an assistant coach at Louisville knew that Adidas employees had arranged for money to be sent to the father of a prospect.“They’re defrauding their own organization, their own employer,” Beebe said, “because they sign off on compliance forms that indicate they’re going to comply.”Kansas Coach Bill Self announced Wednesday that Silvio De Sousa would sit out an exhibition game Thursday pending an investigation, after an attorney said in his closing argument that Self had asked that an Adidas employee arrange to pay his guardian.Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame former Louisville coach who was fired in the wake of the charges, was also aware of the scheme involving his team, the attorney said. Neither head coach was clearly implicated in witness testimony, although text messages and phone calls suggested they were aware that Adidas associates were involved in recruiting. Pitino has denied knowledge of the plan. Self declined to comment Wednesday morning while the trial was still pending.In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Kansas’s president and athletic director said: “Some of the information we were aware of, and some is new to us. The new information needs to be evaluated and understood. We have already been in contact with the N.C.A.A. regarding trial developments and will continue to work with N.C.A.A. staff moving forward.”Louisville had no comment Wednesday.In the most prominent scheme, Dawkins, Code and Gatto worked to send $100,000 in four installments to the father of Brian Bowen II after the son, a top prospect, committed to Louisville in the spring of 2017.Munish Sood, a money manager who was initially charged before reaching an agreement with the government, testified that he was in on the plan. Bowen’s father, Brian Bowen Sr., confirmed much of the allegations in his own testimony, though he said that his son never knew about the deal, or the thousands of dollars he received from other sources related to where his son plied his ample talents.Brian Bowen II was removed from practices at Louisville when the charges came out. He transferred to South Carolina but was not permitted to play, and then entered the N.B.A draft before withdrawing to play for a professional team in Australia.The three men charged in the case had pleaded not guilty, and none of them took the stand. Their primary defense was that their behavior may have violated N.C.A.A. bylaws, but that it was not a federal crime.“N.C.A.A. rules were broken,” Michael Schachter, one of Gatto’s attorneys, said in his opening argument. “Jim and Adidas helped out financially a few families whose sons are among the most talented athletes in America. That happened.”However, he added: “The N.C.A.A.’s rules are not the laws of this country. The N.C.A.A. is not the U.S. Congress.”"
"The 2018-19 college basketball season begins tonight with a full slate of games filled with the top young players in the country. With changes to draft rules on the horizon, the era of one-and-done in college basketball may be drawing to a close. But for this season at least, the college game will again be dominated by freshmen making brief cameos in college towns across America. Here are the top 10 one-and-done players you’ll be watching in college basketball ... briefly.ESPN rated them 1-2-3 in this season’s recruiting class. NBAdraft.net forecasts them to go 1-2-4 in next year’s draft (with Sekou Doumbouya of France at No. 3). And yeah, of course they’re all going to Duke.Barrett is 6 feet 6 inches tall but quick enough to play shooting guard. Williamson is one of the best jumpers the game has seen. Reddish can score and pass. The three begin their college careers on Tuesday against No. 2 Kentucky.Who’s the best of them? Pick any order. These freshman should give Duke an incredible season (it is ranked No. 4 in the preseason A.P. poll after a 29-8 season). Then they will all vanish to the N.B.A.What’s not to like about Bol Bol? He’s the son of beloved ex-N.B.A. player Manute Bol, sharing his spindly frame but having even more skills. He’s also a sneakerhead, writing on The Player’s Tribune that a key to his choice of Oregon was the athletic gear available: “Shoes lined up on chairs. Custom Oregon colorway Jordans. Like 13 different jersey combinations. Nike stuff that hasn’t come out yet. Those Jordan 4 Oregon retros that LeBron was wearing recently — they had those in there.”ESPN rated Bol the No. 4 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go 14th in the N.B.A. draft.If North Carolina is going to match Duke and its freshman triumvirate in the A.C.C., it will need a great season from Little, a do-it-all kind of player. The Athletic compared him to Kawhi Leonard.ESPN rated Little the No. 6 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go fifth in the N.B.A. draft. It’s hard to believe that the storied Indiana program has not made the N.C.A.A. tournament in four seasons or the Final Four in 18. Langford probably won’t be able to turn things around by himself, but he could return the team (16-15 last season) to respectability. Scouts praise his ability to create his own shot.ESPN rated Langford the No. 5 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go seventh in the N.B.A. draft. You read that right. It’s not Kentucky, but Western Kentucky that has the elite freshman this season. Western made the NIT Final Four last year and gets a huge upgrade with Bassey. A soccer player in his native Nigeria, Bassey has thrived in his new sport, and, if anything, is expected to be a better pro than a collegian.ESPN rated Bassey the No. 18 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go sixth in the N.B.A. draft. Maryland brought in a strong recruiting class, and Smith is at the top of it, a rare five-star player for the program. A skinny player who scores and plays defense, he joins a team that missed the tournament last season.ESPN rated Smith the No. 10 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go 16th in the N.B.A. draft. What one-and-done list would be complete without a player from Kansas? A versatile guard, Grimes joins a strong returning squad that comes into the season ranked No. 1. As a Kansas one-and-done player with N.B.A. star potential, he joins Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid five years ago and Josh Jackson two years back.ESPN rated Grimes the No. 9 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go 18th in the N.B.A. draft. Wake Forest was 14th in the A.C.C. last season, and despite some good seasons here and there has never escaped the shadow of the conference’s superteams. Wake lost several key players in the off season leaving a tall order for Jaylen Hoard of France, an inside-outside player. Don’t expect Wake to compete with Duke and its three superfreshmen.ESPN rated Hoard the No. 22 high school recruit, and NBADraft.net forecasts him to go ninth in the N.B.A. draft. "
"BUIES CREEK, N.C. — With three seconds left in the first half last Wednesday night, Campbell point guard Chris Clemons was fouled on a layup. He banged the floor in frustration as the ball rimmed out, then rose and hit both free throws. Someone in the sparsely populated stands yelled, “Congratulations, Chris!” Given the size of the crowd, it’s almost certain Clemons heard him.The second free throw was Clemons’s 22nd point of the night, and the 2,952nd of his four-season career at Campbell, a private university about an hour’s drive south of Raleigh, N.C., his hometown. It also meant Clemons, a senior, had entered the top 10 of the men’s Division I college basketball career scoring list, passing the former Kansas star Danny Manning. By the end of the game, when Clemons had finished off a season-high 48-point effort, he had passed Oscar Robertson, too.“It’s kind of a gift and a curse that you’re not really able to enjoy the moment — or that I chose not to, rather,” Clemons said. “I do understand the significance of the events.”History is being made in college basketball this season, but not all of it is being made for teams that are likely bound for the Final Four or by players who are projected to be selected early in the next N.B.A. draft.With 3,006 career points at Campbell, Clemons is two behind Hersey Hawkins, the former Bradley player, for eighth all time, heading into Thursday’s game with High Point. At South Dakota State, another senior, Mike Daum, is poised to break into the top 10 by season’s end; with 2,943 points, he could pass Manning in the Jackrabbits’ game on Thursday against Fort Wayne.It is an unignorable fact that most of the players still ahead of Clemons and Daum on the career scoring list are not household names, either. After Hawkins, for instance, Clemons could pass Keydren Clark, who played for St. Peter’s, in Jersey City; Harry Kelly of Texas Southern, in Houston; and perhaps even Alphonso Ford of Mississippi Valley State, who holds fourth place with 3,165 points. (First place, by a country mile, with 3,667 points, is the Louisiana State legend Pete Maravich, even though he played only three seasons.)“I recognize that a lot of people on that list, who scored a lot of points in college, didn’t go on to have successful N.B.A. careers,” said Hawkins, who did have a successful N.B.A. career and now works for the Portland Trail Blazers.Freeman Williams — who is second, and the scorer of 3,249 points for Portland State — acknowledged that his college years had been his glory days. “I got most of my attention as a basketball player back then,” he said.Clemons and Daum fit in the same category. Daum is a two-time (and probable three-time) Summit League player of the year. Clemons is leading all Division I players in scoring this season, averaging nearly 30 points a game. Although both are likely to get opportunities to shine during the N.B.A.’s summer league or on its development league rosters, said Fran Fraschilla, the former coach and ESPN draft analyst, the 6-foot 9-inch Daum is at best a late-second-round draft pick. Clemons, who is listed at 5-9, is unlikely to be drafted at all.The relative anonymity of college basketball’s leading career scorers appears to be a feature, not a bug. If you are scoring so many points for so much time, you most likely are not doing so at college basketball’s heights.“If Mike Daum or Chris Clemons had gone to play in the Big Ten or the A.C.C.,” Fraschilla said last week, referring to the Atlantic Coast Conference, “they wouldn’t be on the verge of scoring 3,000 points.”He added, “As good players as they are, they would be on teams with other really talented players, as opposed to going to a school like S.D.S.U. or Campbell, where virtually from Day 1 their talent was such that they were the dominant player not only on their team but in their league.”And had they dominated as they have in a bigger league, they probably wouldn’t be seniors; the best college basketball players are around for only one or two seasons.“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said Lionel Simmons, who is third with 3,217 career points for La Salle. “Some of these players, if they didn’t come out early, they could have scored 3,000.”But even when top talents played for three or four college seasons, they did so for top teams whose other talented players lowered the individual demands on them. Superlative college players like U.C.L.A.’s Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Georgetown’s Patrick Ewing had the kinds of supporting casts that come with championship teams.The most prominent name in the top 20, after Robertson, is Larry Bird, who played most of his college career at Indiana State, a team that he led to the Final Four, but one that needed him to average 30 points a game. But a place on the list can still be a point of pride years later.Hawkins acknowledged that he kept tabs on developments in the career scoring top 10. In 2014, a Blazers scout was at the Creighton game in which Doug McDermott, now of the Indiana Pacers, passed Hawkins. “He was texting me, ‘Six points away,’ ‘Two points away,’” Hawkins said. “He thought it was funny. I was sitting at dinner getting texted every three minutes.”Last week, Clemons deflected postgame questions about passing Manning and Robertson, saying he was focused on this season, in which the Fighting Camels (15-11) are third in the Big South. Asked whether he had kept the game ball, he laughed; of course he had not.“After it’s all said and done, I’ll definitely go back and look, reminisce on the years I’ve had here, kind of be amazed at myself, know what I was able to accomplish,” Clemons said.Like Clemons, Daum emphasized in a telephone interview that he has been putting his team first. Still, he said, he could not help noticing recently when he passed Bird, as well as Duke’s J. J. Redick and North Carolina’s Tyler Hansbrough, two stars from the last decade whom Daum had grown up watching.“I feel like I’m going to look back on it” — his eventual scoring total — “maybe when I’m older, and be like, ‘See how cool it was to be in that position,’” Daum said.“For me personally,” he added, “it’s just getting ready for the next thing.”"
"Fans tuning in to Saturday’s marquee matchup between Duke and Virginia waited less than two minutes before getting what they came for. On an early Virginia possession, Duke’s Zion Williamson, the impossible freshman who moves with a guard’s agility while weighing 280 pounds, recovered a loose ball and hammered down a two-handed dunk with Old Testament fury.Williamson is expected to be the top pick in this year’s N.B.A. draft and has been this season’s signature player — a quality so inseparable from his ferocious slams that a rare missed dunk last week against Boston College became a highlight in its own right.The only other player who has come close to capturing the collective imagination as Williamson is Murray State’s Ja Morant, a 6-foot-3 sophomore who has played his way from virtual anonymity to likely top-five draft position on a diet of Jordan-esque leaping, flying slams.That Williamson and Morant are this season’s college basketball folk heroes is in one sense entirely logical. Dunks are popular, they dunk well, therefore they are popular.Yet in the context of recent history and current basketball trends, they are outliers as stars because they are relatively poor shooters from long distance.Neither player can efficiently utilize the 3-pointer, which has cemented itself as the most treasured tool in the modern offensive game. Williamson has made less than 30 percent of the 47 3-pointers he has attempted. Morant is at 32.7 percent, below the Division I average of 34.3 percent.Williamson’s attitude toward the 3-pointer may be best summarized not by any of his own shots, but by his sensational block of De’Andre Hunter’s ill-fated attempt late in Saturday’s game, an 81-71 Duke victory.Their proficiency in dunking over long-distance shooting signals how special they are, of course, but also might herald a market correction in which basketball’s most reliable shot is back in.In recent seasons, the defining players — the ones who made the biggest impacts and summed up the college basketball zeitgeist — have overwhelmingly been sharpshooters. Think of Oklahoma’s Trae Young and Buddy Hield, Kansas’ Frank Mason III, Indiana’s Yogi Ferrell, Purdue’s Caleb Swanigan and even Duke’s infamous Grayson Allen. The last 7-footer to be named player of the year, Wisconsin’s Frank Kaminsky, was not a high-volume shooter of 3s, but he made 41.6 percent of his attempts in his Wooden Award-winning season. Villanova won a title at the buzzer when Kris Jenkins hit a 3.Yet this year’s watch list for the Wooden Award includes Williamson and Morant along with other poor-shooting yet exciting non-big men like Duke’s R.J. Barrett and Tennessee’s Grant Williams. Marquette’s Markus Howard has received comparatively little attention as this year’s exemplary high-volume, high-accuracy distance shooter.The ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said dunks were emerging as more crucial to offenses because so-called midrange shots — 2-point attempts that are not from close in near the basket — have been so devalued by analytics. Get to the rim. Get fouled. Or take a 3. Those are the modern basketball credos.Bilas said it was possible that, after several years in which the 3-pointer has predominated in top offenses, coaches have improved at devising defenses to stymie perimeter shooting — in that way placing a premium on wing players who excel at close range. But mainly Williamson and Morant stand out because they are standouts.“We’re seeing more dunks because there are more spectacular athletes out there,” he said.“A lot of guys can dunk, but he dunks on the way up,” he added of Williamson. “His head is literally at or over the rim every time.”Recent seasons’ emphasis on the 3 was easy to understand if you looked to the N.B.A.’s discovery of the 3-pointer’s efficiency. The Golden State Warriors emerged as a dynasty thanks in part to their high-volume 3-point shooting, and even they have been surpassed by teams like the Houston Rockets who attempt 3s at record numbers while confining their other shots to the restricted area under the basket.Meanwhile, the trey picked up a cachet that had previously been reserved only for the jam. Players who sank one from deep mimicked bow-and-arrow shots toward their benches, igniting their teammates; Stephen Curry, Hield and Young became the players youngsters aspired to play like.And to be sure, 3-pointers have not gone away. This season they account for nearly a third of the points scored in Division I, according to KenPom.com, the highest ever and part of a steady upward trajectory. Teams are making 34.3 percent of attempts, which is just a few fractions of a percent off the past couple years’ heights.What have positively plummeted are, as Bilas suggested, midrange attempts. According to Ken Pomeroy, KenPom.com’s proprietor, midrange shots — defined essentially as 2-point attempts beyond a couple feet from the basket — account for barely a quarter of total field goal attempts this season. That figure was 33 percent as recently as the 2012-13 season.“The 15- to 20-footers are becoming extinct,” Pomeroy said in an interview.With players setting up farther from the basket, the dunk opportunity has opened perhaps more than ever before. And into that breach have stepped an uncommonly talented crop of dunkers.“This is the best dunking college basketball has seen in a while,” said Chuck Millan, a dunk coach involved not only with high schoolers but with the N.B.A.’s dunk contest, which will be staged Saturday night.Millan highlighted lesser known players with sensational abilities, including Connecticut’s Kwintin Williams, Florida Gulf Coast’s Troy Baxter and Arkansas-Little Rock’s Rayjon Tucker — “a freak of nature,” as Millan put it.As for Williamson and Morant, Millan said that, as with chocolate and vanilla, a comparison comes down to personal preference — although he may ultimately fall on Team Zion.“With Ja, it’s the dunks in traffic, because he’s little, and the body contact he takes,” Millan said. “Zion, being 6-8, 280, seeing him be just so agile and almost ballerina-like, being such a huge dude — it’s more impressive.”"
"ALBANY — Lauren Mullen pulled her black hat low over her eyes, paid $10 for a ticket and entered Sefcu Arena just before tip-off recently. She sat in Section 150. There were 18 rows between her and any other fans. She trained her focus on the two head coaches.On the visiting bench sat the University of Massachusetts, Lowell coach, Tom Garrick, a former N.B.A. player. Last spring, Mullen, then the women’s basketball coach at New York University, interviewed for the position that Garrick now holds. It was the third time in four years that she had been a finalist for a Division I head-coaching job. Her résumé included a 103-58 record and five postseason berths with the Violets.On the home sideline stood Mullen’s wife, Colleen, the coach of SUNY Albany. Colleen got the job one month after Lauren lost out to Garrick. An associate coach at West Point for six years, Colleen reached the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament twice. When Albany hired Colleen, Lauren resigned from N.Y.U. to stay at home with their children: Maggie, 3, and their 1-year-old twins, Brennan and Callan.“When you think about it, if I had gotten the Lowell job, I would’ve been over there,” Lauren said, pointing to Garrick. And Colleen, she added, would have been with the children. “Crazy, just crazy,’’ she said.It is, though, the path they are taking as a same-sex coaching couple with three small children and all sorts of demands and challenges. Indeed, Colleen joined a small sorority when Albany hired her. Although the Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage three years ago and college campuses can be among the more progressive places in the United States, Colleen says she is one of only five women she knows of who are openly gay head coaches in college basketball. She recalled how Sue Johnson, her coach at the University of New Hampshire at the time who is now the athletic director at Concord Academy in Massachusetts, came out 16 years ago, when Colleen was a senior. At the time, Johnson’s longtime partner, Kelly, was pregnant, and Johnson informed the team of their relationship after a practice.It was the chaos familiar to a lot of dual-income households that led Lauren and Colleen to a crossroads last winter. After four years of matching basketball calendars to Colleen’s biological clock to plan births for the off-season, timing recruiting calls around nap schedules, and wrestling with nanny problems and a merry-go-round of fill-in babysitters, they needed a change. “We were at a breaking point,” Colleen said. “A lot of coming and going.”“Absolute insanity,” Lauren said. “To be frank, at the end of last year, it was like, ‘O.K., what are we going to do?’”Both 38, the Mullens knew one of them needed to get a Division I head coaching job so the other could afford to step back into a supporting role. A pact was made early on. They would not pursue the same jobs, though they had competed for employment once before. That occurred when they met, in 2007. At the time, Lauren was a graduate assistant at Lehigh. There was an opening for an assistant coaching position, and Lauren applied for the internal promotion. Colleen, then an assistant at Southern New Hampshire University, also applied. They possessed similar credentials. Colleen stood 5 feet 2 inches and had starred at the University of New Hampshire as a pass-first point guard. Lauren was 5-foot-4, and was a facilitator at Hofstra. Colleen, who is six months older, got the job. Soon after, they played one-on-one for the first and only time. Lauren beat Colleen. Any lingering tension turned to mutual interest. On opening day of practice that season, they went on their first date.“She didn’t hate me for that long,” Colleen said. “She got a master’s from Lehigh. She’s in good shape.”Early in their relationship, they visited Colleen’s family. While there, they realized they had played in the same Florida tournament when they were 13. Colleen found a photo that captured Lauren guarding her on an inbounds play.They kept their relationship quiet as they began to climb the coaching ladder, drawing interest from South Carolina to Connecticut. Once, while Colleen was at Long Island University and Lauren was at Sacred Heart in Connecticut, they were in the same conference. L.I.U. beat Sacred Heart both times they played.“I slept on the couch,” Colleen said. “It’s fine.”“She’s lying,” Lauren said. “She would have made me sleep on the couch. Takes her a little time to let the steam off.”Colleen went north to West Point to become an assistant coach in June 2011. Weeks later, President Obama ended the United States military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, the 17-year-old law that banned openly gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from military service. Colleen then found herself in competition with Lauren once more, this time for a recruit. Her name was Kelsey Minato, from Huntington Beach, Calif. Minato was a prolific outside scorer and Lauren was the first to reach out to her. She and Colleen had sat side-by-side in the stands watching Minato at a tournament in Arizona, and Colleen encouraged Lauren to speak with Minato’s coach afterward. Lauren followed through. A few weeks later, Army realized it needed a guard, and Colleen asked Lauren whether she would mind if Army pursued Minato. Lauren welcomed the competition. Minato was unaware of the relationship between the recruiters, and narrowed her choices to Sacred Heart and Army. She eventually became the best player in Army history, scoring 49 points in one game, breaking records and having her No. 5 jersey retired.“I was going to ride that wave for a long time, have a nice halo around my head for finding her,” Colleen said.But it was Lauren who became a head coach first. That summer, she signed on to lead N.Y.U. While Colleen sold recruits on West Point’s structure, Lauren pitched West Fourth Street’s freedom. One day, Lauren announced that practice was canceled. In came the West Point women in camouflage gear for a boot camp.“My players were all like, ‘Oh, no!’” Lauren said. “They wanted no part.’’In any case, wins at both programs followed, along with a wedding in May 2014. “New experience for me,” said Dave Magarity, the head coach of the West Point women’s team. “There were a lot of cigars floating around.”The Mullens were living in Ossining, N.Y. — 26 miles from West Point, 36 miles from Greenwich Village. And Colleen, known as The Mullenator at West Point, recalled that Magarity defended her sexual orientation. When a recruit’s parent asked which members of his staff were married, Magarity said, “Don’t ever ask that question again.”“Dave was like papa bear,” Colleen said.Last May, Albany, which has reached six of the last seven N.C.A.A. tournaments, hired Colleen as its head coach. After starting 1-9, the Great Danes have gone 10-5 and are tied for third place in the America East.As a head coach, Colleen, who has been openly gay since college, now finds herself calculating when to mention Lauren, who came out when she was in her mid-20s. “When I am talking to certain people, and I bring up my wife, there’s a second thought in my head,” Colleen said. “It’s like, ‘Should I just talk about my kids?’ It doesn’t feel right when you censor yourself.”Up in the stands, it has not taken long for Lauren to find her voice as a spectator. When the season schedule was announced, she cleared her calendar to be in attendance at Albany’s opener at the University of South Florida. She had not been able to make one of Colleen’s games in years. In the stands, Lauren described herself as “out of control.’’“I knew it, but I couldn’t help myself,’’ Lauren said. “I was like, I need to calm down, but then I’d say, ‘That’s a walk! They walked!’” She and Colleen bought a house in Bethlehem, N.Y., last August. On a recent night there, Maggie played with Disney princess stamps as Lauren cut chicken nuggets for the boys. A chalkboard featured a to-do list above a diagram of “Double Horns,” an offensive set.“We’re like a sociology experiment because Maggie wants gowns and she’d maybe seen her moms in like 10 dresses combined,” Lauren said. The boys, she added, had all girls toys to choose from but are indicating an interest in trucks.And Maggie is learning what comes with winning. After a victory over the University of Maryland Baltimore County, the Great Danes awaited Colleen in the home locker room. Maggie was hesitant to go inside, so Lauren let her know that she would be waiting in the hallway. After Maggie and Colleen entered, the door closed behind them. A roar could be heard as guard Kyara Frames lifted Colleen in the air, per their celebratory custom. Eleven seconds later, Maggie ran out crying.“Mom’s having fun,” Lauren told her. “The girls are having fun.”"
"A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed on Friday afternoon while playing basketball at a playground in Brooklyn, the police said.Officers found the boy, Oluwadurotimi Joseph Oyebola, known as Timi, with a gunshot wound to his head shortly before 4 p.m. in Brownsville, the authorities said. He had been playing basketball after school with three friends at Chester Playground, which is next to Public School 396, when at least one or two people fired shots from the southern end of the park, Assistant Chief Jeffrey Maddrey told reporters.Two males were seen fleeing south on Chester Street, the police said.The boy was taken to Brookdale Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The police said that they did not know the motive for the killing and that it was possible that the boy was not the target of the shooting.Oluwadurotimi lived in Jamaica, Queens, and attended a charter school near the playground, Deputy Chief Michael Kemper said. The shots were fired more than 100 feet away from the boys, Chief Kemper said.“He was a really, really good kid,” he said. “There’s a strong possibility that he was the unintended target of this bullet.”Oluwadurotimi was in 11th grade at Brooklyn Ascend High School in Brownsville, said Steven F. Wilson, the chief executive of the Ascend charter school network. Oluwadurotimi’s school is about a half-mile west of the playground where he was shot.Oluwadurotimi moved to New York with his parents and sister from Lagos, Nigeria, in 2013, said his father, David Oyebola.“He was a good boy. He was my strength,” Mr. Oyebola said. “It’s a big loss that I can never recover from.”Oluwadurotimi’s favorite subjects in school were math and science, his father said, and he wanted to have a career as a doctor or engineer. In November, he was scheduled to accept a national award for academic achievement at Columbia University.Mr. Oyebola, 49, a minister at the Abundant Life Christian Center in Brooklyn, said his son was active in the church and was supposed to attend a worship session on Friday. He said he often worried about his son being in the neighborhood near his school because he had heard about shootings there.He would ask Oluwadurotimi to tell him when he arrived at school and left for the day, Mr. Oyebola said. At 5 p.m., when he received a call saying his son had been shot, he rushed to the hospital to see him.“The authorities are supposed to protect us,” he said. “So I’d like an answer: Who killed my son? I’d like justice to be done.”Mr. Wilson, the charter school’s executive, said Oluwadurotimi was a dedicated student who often stayed at school into the evening to study and meet with his teachers. He was quiet but witty, and he was so passionate about basketball that he often carried a ball around with him, Mr. Wilson said.“Oluwadurotimi’s future was bright, and it is simply unfathomable that it was cut short so heinously,” he said.Tolu Olowoyo, 16, said he became friends with Oluwadurotimi when the Oyebola family emigrated from Nigeria about five years ago. Tolu said he had a knack for making his friends laugh and was selfless, too.“He’d go out of his way to help others,” he said.Madeline Sanders, 40, a mother of three who lives near the park and attended the nearby public school, said the shooting made her anxious because her son plays basketball there.Gesturing to the block that had been roped off by the police, Ms. Sanders said her siblings had a barbecue there just last weekend and she had considered it a safe place.“This is broad daylight and a full schoolyard,” Ms. Sanders said. “Now it’s like, ‘Are our kids safe?’ And you want to believe your kids are safe in the neighborhood we grew up.”Her husband, Richard Sanders, 44, said he believed it was a safe community, but that there was a problem with teenagers getting ahold of guns that must be solved.“They bring the guns to the basketball court,” he said. “Unbelievable.”At about 10 p.m., congregants from Mr. Oyebola’s church entered his house in Queens to pray with his family.“We believe that in the last moments of his life, the Lord had him,” a preacher said. “He is sleeping in the flesh, but alive in the soul.”"
"Philadelphia has the Big 5. The state of Iowa has the Big Four — an informal confederation of Division I basketball programs, linked by geography, passion and the never-ending pursuit of bragging rights.The four-way rivalry was kindled in the late 1970s when the University of Northern Iowa joined Division I. For decades, Iowa and Iowa State, the major conference stalwarts, annually scheduled games against the midmajors Drake and U.N.I., alternating home sites each year, before the programs began playing a four-team doubleheader in Des Moines in 2012. The games are usually competitive, and fans relish them.Darian DeVries, who is Drake’s first-year coach and who grew up in the small northern Iowa town of Aplington, attended a memorable Big Four game in 1990 with his father, Vern, and younger brother, Jared (a future Detroit Lions defensive end). They were among 22,791 packed into the U.N.I. Dome as the Panthers and their high-scoring star Jason Reese upset the 20th-ranked Hawkeyes, 77-74, on the way to the program’s first Division I N.C.A.A. tournament berth.“I’m not sure we could see anything, but it was the most incredible sporting event ever,” DeVries said after a recent Bulldogs game in Minneapolis. “That was my greatest memory as a kid.”But the chance for additional memories is about to end, for the foreseeable future at least, as these cherished games seemingly fall victim to the larger programs’ concerns about upsets and not making the N.C.A.A. tournament — an approach that is bound to make it harder for midmajors everywhere to get to the tournament, too.This year’s version of what is now known as the Hy-Vee Classic at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, scheduled for Saturday, will be the last, ending a seven-year run. (Hy-Vee is a Midwest supermarket chain.) Earlier this year, Iowa announced it was withdrawing from the event. The move blindsided the other programs and, beginning in 2020, could have significant impact on which teams make the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament, whose selection committee likes so-called midmajors to have upsets of bigger programs on their résumés.Iowa appears uninterested in scheduling U.N.I., a strong midmajor with four N.C.A.A. tournament appearances since 2009, or Drake, a rival dating to 1909. And fans statewide, like Steve Nyquist, a Drake alumnus and Bulldogs season-ticket holder from Des Moines, are angry.“Almost all decisions come down to money,” Nyquist said during a recent Drake game against North Dakota State at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. “That’s my cynical belief, anyway,”Money certainly was part of it. Hawkeyes Athletic Director Gary Barta exercised a clause his university had demanded as a condition for extending the Classic — originally called the Big Four Classic — through 2019. The clause permitted a team to opt out if its conference required 22 contracted games. This season, the Big Ten Conference schedule expanded to 20 games from 18. That, plus crossover games with the Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences, brought Iowa’s total to 22.Barta declined an interview request from The New York Times. In a statement released when Iowa announced its decision, Barta was quoted as saying that the new conference requirements “created some scheduling challenges that impacts this event” and that future games with in-state programs would be considered case by case.“Our fans are certainly upset,” said Northern Iowa Athletic Director David Harris, who was formerly the senior associate athletic director at Iowa State. He said the U.N.I. faithful would really like to return to the home-and-home schedule, which probably is not going to happen, either. “That doesn’t appear to be in the cards right now.”Iowa and Iowa State, which plays in the Big 12, meet every year in a nonconference series that dates to the 1970s, alternating home sites. There are no plans to discontinue that series.The Big Four/Hy-Vee Classic began because Iowa and Iowa State refused to continue playing at U.N.I. or Drake, whose arenas seat about 7,000, significantly less than Carver-Hawkeye Arena at Iowa (15,400) and Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State (14,384). Power 5 programs load up on nonconference games at home, paying opponents guarantees of up to $100,000 for the privilege — so-called “buy” games that they usually win.Although the Classic never sold out, it drew roughly 13,000 to 15,000 in the 16,980-seat Wells Fargo Arena. Two people familiar with the finances said each program earned $125,000 or more annually from the event.Drake Athletic Director Brian Hardin, who grew up in Des Moines rooting for the Bulldogs as the son of two Drake alumni, said football had replaced basketball as the dominant sport in Iowa. “While this isn’t the major reason why, I can’t imagine that the fact that the four division schools are not playing each other is going to help bring basketball back to the prominence it once had in our state,” he said. “And that’s disappointing.”Hardin has reached out to Iowa’s Barta and Iowa State Athletic Director Jamie Pollard, hoping to get back on their schedules. Pollard declined an interview request, but an Iowa State spokesman said the team hopes to keep playing Drake and U.N.I.It may not be easy. Drake and Iowa State have met 174 times since 1908, but Hardin is not keen on the Bulldogs’ going to Ames every year, which Iowa State might insist on.Harris, the U.N.I. athletic director, said his team had not decided whether to pursue future games with Iowa State or Iowa. Drake and U.N.I. meet twice a year in Missouri Valley Conference play.U.N.I. may be a victim of its own success. Under Coach Ben Jacobson, U.N.I. has a history of upsetting top teams, making it an unpopular opponent. The Panthers knocked top-seeded Kansas out of the 2010 N.C.A.A. tournament, stunned top-ranked North Carolina at the McLeod Center in November 2015 and beat Iowa and Iowa State in the Classic in consecutive years.Jacobson said U.N.I. was already struggling to schedule quality nonconference games, which are crucial to gaining at-large N.C.A.A. tournament consideration. The demise of the Classic does not help.“The Power 5, and maybe a league or two after that, they’re going to play most of their games against each other,” said Jacobson, who foresees a tougher road to the tournament for his program and for Drake. “That’s what is bothersome.”But basketball fans in Iowa might just need to be patient.Seven years ago, four Division I programs in Indiana — Notre Dame, Butler, Purdue and the Hoosiers — revived a two-game showcase that disappeared in the 1940s, known then as the Hoosier Classic and now called the Crossroads Classic. And in Philadelphia, even the Big 5 fizzled for eight years in the 1990s, when Rollie Massimino, then Villanova’s coach, stopped scheduling the other teams every season. Steve Lappas succeeded Massimino and restored full round-robin play in 1999.For now, the state of Iowa awaits its Steve Lappas."
"The University of North Carolina has put the staff of its women’s basketball team on indefinite leave pending an investigation into the program.In a statement, the university said the investigation was prompted by “issues raised by student-athletes and others.”A Charlotte law firm will review the program. The head coach, Sylvia Hatchell, and her three assistants will be paid during the investigation.“Of course, I will cooperate fully in this review,” Hatchell said in a statement Monday, after the university announced its decision. “I look forward to a prompt conclusion of this matter and the continuation of our very successful women’s basketball program.”Hatchell, who has coached the team since 1986, is in the basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. She won the national championship in 1994 and made two other Final Fours.Several highly touted players have transferred away from North Carolina in recent years, notably Diamond DeShields, who despite a strong freshman year on court moved on to Tennessee and then the W.N.B.A.Hatchell, 67, was found to have leukemia in 2013, but after treatment returned to the team.This season North Carolina was 18-15 and returned for the first time in four years to the N.C.A.A. tournament, where it lost in the first round.But her tenure recently has been rocky. Most notably, the team was at the center of an N.C.A.A. investigation into fake African Studies classes largely populated by athletes who got high grades for little, if any, work.Many of the accusations in the case focused on Jan Boxill, an academic adviser to the women’s basketball team, who was said to have improperly helped players academically and steered them to the bogus courses. She eventually resigned from the university.The N.C.A.A. eventually ruled that the team would receive no penalties because the classes were also available to nonathletes.The university has not elaborated on the nature of the complaints that prompted the new investigation."
"CLEVELAND — The Los Angeles Lakers are not a great team, but they employ the greatest player in the world. They seem to be grasping the potential benefits of such an arrangement. LeBron James can compensate for many problems: lackluster defense, questionable decisions, growing pains.“He comes out and plays the game pure,” Coach Luke Walton said.On Wednesday night, the difference between his presence (on the Lakers) and his absence (from the Cavaliers) was clear in his return to Cleveland, where fans came to Quicken Loans Arena to pay their respects to a bygone era — the LeBron Era. Without him, the Cavaliers are a bad team, one of the worst in the league. James feels for them.“A lot of the guys have worked their tails off to get to where they are in their career,” James said after the Lakers escaped with a 109-105 victory, “and you never want to see your friends be in the situation that they’re in. But as professionals, they’re still giving it all they got.”After decamping to Los Angeles in free agency over the summer, James belongs to the Lakers now — or perhaps they belong to him. They are not championship contenders, not yet anyway, but they are winning most of the games they should win and learning as they go.“It’s happening,” Walton said, “and it’s good to see it happening, but it’s still the early stages of where we ultimately need to get to.”Their win against the Cavaliers was the latest example, a flawed effort that James mended by collecting 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7 assists. The Lakers, who improved to 10-7, have won six of their last seven games. Their progress was on display in front of James’s old fans and teammates and coaches, who are familiar with his ability to elevate those around him.“He’s done this everywhere he’s gone,” Cavaliers Coach Larry Drew said. “He’s such a dominant force.”The game — billed as a homecoming — was free of the vitriol that was directed toward James in 2010, when he made his first trip back to Cleveland as a freshly minted member of the Miami Heat. Back then, James and his teammates actually feared for their safety. Skirmishes broke out in the stands. James scored 38 points in a lopsided win.On Wednesday, the crowd was appreciative, offering him a warm welcome, albeit one tinged with sadness. No one booed. No one threw anything. People just missed him.Jay Ventura, 23, and Natalie Miller, 20, college students from Akron, Ohio, James’s hometown, bought tickets for the game over the summer, when they first became available. They wore James jerseys that were half Lakers and half Cavaliers, homemade homages to their favorite player.“It’s a little bittersweet,” Ventura said, “but it’s different now. He did everything he said he was going to do for us, you know? He delivered his promise.”That promise was fulfilled in 2016: a championship, the Cavaliers’ first and only. Clips of their title run were included in a video montage that the team played during the first timeout of Wednesday’s game, not long after a reminder that fans were entitled to free chicken nuggets if the Cavaliers scored at least 100 points. (Not all was lost in the end.)In any case, James was touched by the gesture. He saw only part of the montage — Walton, he said, was drawing up a play in the huddle, and James did not want to mess it up — but he raised his arms to acknowledge the crowd after the timeout and clasped his hands together in a sign of gratitude.“I appreciate these fans,” he said, “just as much as they appreciate me.”His departure from Cleveland has somehow enhanced his greatness, if that is possible. The Cavaliers, just months removed from a fourth straight trip to the N.B.A. finals, are 2-14. To be fair, Kevin Love has missed all but four games because of a foot surgery — but still, it is a dismal scene here. Before Wednesday’s game, Drew had to address J.R. Smith’s recent accusation that the Cavaliers had been actively trying to lose to improve their chances of landing a top pick in next year’s draft — tanking, in other words. Smith is no longer with the team.“My guys are playing hard,” Drew said, “and when they’re not playing hard, I make them aware that they’re not playing hard.”The Lakers, though, are improving by the week. Forgotten is their early-season brawl with the Houston Rockets. Fading are James’s woes from the free-throw line, though they remain a bit of an issue. It seems almost quaint to recall that team president Magic Johnson chastised Walton when the Lakers stumbled to a 3-5 start.Little about their season has been particularly easy, and after surviving suspensions stemming from the aforementioned brawl, the Lakers are adjusting to life without point guard Rajon Rondo, who broke his hand last week. Adding the veteran center Tyson Chandler has helped, because he is a respected voice in the locker room and a fierce defender.But the Lakers are inexperienced, and Chandler cited the importance of young players like Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball as the team moves forward.“All of these games are good because we’re so young,” Chandler said. “The core of our team and what’s going to be the deciding factor is our youth, our young players: Kuz, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart. They’re going to decide down the stretch what our season is going to really be like. It’s going to be the development of them.”It helps, of course, that the Lakers have the ultimate mentor in James, whose brand of tough love can travel a fine line between abrasive and effective. But he has vowed to exercise patience this season, and Walton has been careful to highlight the players who are toiling in James’s shadow.After Wednesday’s game, for example, Walton praised the play of Ball, the team’s starting point guard, who finished with 15 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists.“I loved it,” Walton said. “It was one of my favorite parts of our game — how much he was attacking the rim, even the ones he didn’t finish. I didn’t care. Just seeing him get downhill and be physical and play-make, he’s so gifted with that. To see him kind of take that next step was really a positive for us.”In the locker room, James joined his teammates for a postgame meal that included hamburgers from Swensons, a chain that originated in Akron.“We grew up on these things,” said Randy Mims, James’s childhood friend and longtime confidant.James dressed in a T-shirt that read, “All Good Never Better,” before leaving the arena for the airport and a long flight home."
"HARTFORD — The news struck the Connecticut faithful like a punch.Haley Jones, a 6-foot-1 wing player from Santa Cruz, Calif., who is considered the top women’s basketball recruit in the country, chose Stanford over UConn on Wednesday.That followed a recent decision by another top recruit, Aliyah Boston, a 6-4 post player from Worcester, Mass., to play for South Carolina instead of the Huskies.Which followed the departure last spring of the 6-6 Azura Stevens to the W.N.B.A. with a season of eligibility remaining.Which inflamed the sting of last-second defeats to Notre Dame and Mississippi State in the past two national semifinals.These, of course, are first-world problems. No one is throwing a pity party for the Huskies. But the futile recruiting of Jones seemed to bring rare and existential alarm to UConn fans.“I’ve had people tell me UConn basketball is dead,” said Daniel Connolly, a student who is a reporter and editor for The UConn Blog. “A certain sector of the Twitter-verse is definitely panicking.”Connolly sat along press row Wednesday night at Hartford’s XL Center as the second-ranked Huskies (6-0) dismantled No. 16 DePaul. It was a final tuneup for Sunday’s trip to face top-ranked Notre Dame (7-0), the defending national champion, in the sport’s premier matchup.Asked about potholes along the recruiting trail, Coach Geno Auriemma answered with the mock despair of a coach who has won 11 national championships and has averaged 30-plus victories a season for more than three decades.“What can I say?” Auriemma said. “It’s over.”It does seem rash to predict UConn’s imminent demise. Yet Auriemma and the Huskies awakened Thursday to headlines that would have been unthinkable days or even hours earlier, asking whether the recruiting setbacks meant the “beginning of the end” for the coach and his team.Doug Bruno, the longtime DePaul coach, urged a tapping of the brakes on doom and gloom.“Geno’s not in it to finish second,” he said.Still, an undeniable leveling is occurring in women’s college basketball. Tennessee, the winner of eight national titles, has not reached the Final Four since Pat Summitt retired in 2012 with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. (She died in 2016.) Stanford, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion and Final Four regular, no longer dominates the Pacific-12 Conference and won its last title in 1992. Buffalo and Central Michigan, both 11 seeds, reached the regional semifinals in the 2018 tournament.UConn would surprise no one by winning its 12th N.C.A.A. title this season. But the Huskies have lost the sheen of invincibility, especially to Notre Dame, which played the Huskies, its fiercest rival, as many as four times a season when they both belonged to the Big East Conference.“You have to believe you can win, and I think that starts with me,” Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw said Friday. “Some people are intimidated by their name, by what they’ve accomplished. And we’re not.”Parity creeps like ivy. Dawn Staley coached South Carolina to its first N.C.A.A. title in 2017. And Notre Dame won its second title this spring, 17 years after its first.“You can feel good that we’ve had two different winners the last two years,” McGraw said. “I think it’s really good for the game. It brings more excitement.”Auriemma understands as acutely as anyone that UConn’s dominance has a sell-by date. He has the arc of history as confirmation.In the first 35 years of the men’s N.C.A.A. tournament, U.C.L.A. won 10 championships, but it has won only one since 1975. In the first 35 years of the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament, UConn won 11 titles, the most recent in 2016.How will the future play out? Well, Auriemma is 64. Whenever he leaves, almost no one expects the Huskies to remain a major force if they stay in a middling league like the American Athletic Conference, trying to remain competitive against the financial resources and verdant campuses of the Southeastern Conference, the Pac-12, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big Ten and the Big 12.Enjoy UConn’s success, Auriemma admonished Huskies fans last season, because “this isn’t going to last forever.”The recent blip only reinforces how difficult it is to stay on top, Auriemma said. Since the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament began in 1982, only three schools have won consecutive titles: Southern Cal, Tennessee and UConn.“So you go through some cycles; you’re supposed to,” Auriemma said. “Every single team in America in the last 25 years has gone through some cycle where they’ve not been good, except us. So how do you explain that? And the more you do that, the more it’s out there that it’s supposed to last forever.”Recruiting has grown more complicated. Auriemma prefers to be viewed as an instructor, not as a friend, to his players. But many of today’s recruits, McGraw said, talk of building relationships with their college coaches.“They had that in high school,” she said. “They are looking to be wooed a little bit more. You’re seeing more and more kids, and parents, that love the attention.”Staley of South Carolina, who just signed four of the 13 top-rated high school stars, told The State newspaper about the full-court press that her assistant coaches applied to those recruits, “talking to every single person that’s involved in their lives.”In Auriemma’s view, recruiting has become “too corporate; too many people involved in the process.” But he also remains convinced that he will stock UConn’s roster next season with top-shelf talent, perhaps including graduate transfers and international players.“I’m not worried about that,” he said.This period of uncertainty — and the chance that it is temporary — reminds Auriemma of a stretch after Diana Taurasi had left for the W.N.B.A. in 2004. With her, the Huskies won three consecutive N.C.A.A. titles. Without her, they did not win another national championship for four consecutive seasons.“I read that the program is done, it’s over,” Auriemma said.Except it wasn’t.Maya Moore arrived and UConn won championships in 2009 and 2010. Then Breanna Stewart led the Huskies to four consecutive titles from 2013 through 2016. Winning streaks seemed boundless.“We fell on hard times,” Auriemma said with familiar snark. “It was like we went through a deep depression. We should have won 200 in a row; we only won 111.”"
"Luka Doncic, a leading contender for N.B.A. Rookie of the Year, expressed dismay Friday that his Slovenian national team had not been granted automatic entry into next year’s FIBA World Cup as the reigning EuroBasket winners. The team had tried, and failed, to qualify without him.“I’m so disappointed,” Doncic said in an interview after Friday’s practice with the Dallas Mavericks. “We’re the European champions. We should be playing.”Doncic, 19, is averaging 18.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists for the surprising Mavericks, quickly affirming Dallas’s belief that one of Europe’s best young players had instant N.B.A. star potential.But without Doncic playing, Slovenia is 2-8 in World Cup qualifying with two games to go. Under the previous system, the country would automatically have made the World Cup, which will be played in several cities across China next summer.A controversial format change for the World Cup instituted by FIBA, basketball’s world governing body, has forced 80 countries to compete for the 31 open slots in the field alongside the tournament host, China, via regional qualifying. It is similar to how the soccer World Cup entrants are decided.Two-thirds of the qualifying games, however, clash with the N.B.A. schedule. Unlike their soccer counterparts around the world, who are released to their national teams for qualifying matches via what are known as “international breaks,” N.B.A. players and the majority of Euroleague players are not allowed to leave their teams during the season to represent their respective countries.In Slovenia’s case, that has meant no Doncic, no Goran Dragic of the Miami Heat and the need for a new coach. Phoenix Suns Coach Igor Kokoskov had to surrender his Slovenia post once he took the Suns’ job.The United States also did not receive an automatic berth for the 2019 World Cup as part of the new format — not even as the defending World Cup champion and reigning Olympic champion. But the Americans clinched a spot with a victory Sunday in Uruguay under Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who has posted an 8-2 record in qualifying, relying mostly on players from the N.B.A.’s developmental G League.Thanks to the efforts of Van Gundy and the 46 players he has used in qualifying thus far, USA Basketball will be able to send its usual squad of N.B.A. All-Stars to China under San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, who has replaced Duke University’s Mike Krzyzewski as the full-time national team coach.Led by Doncic, Dragic and Kokoskov, Slovenia made a Cinderella run to the title at the EuroBasket tournament in 2017 — something Doncic described as “more amazing than anything in my life.”“To be European champions and not be in the World Cup, it’s tough,” Doncic said Friday. “I don’t know why they changed it.”Asked how his countrymen were taking it, Doncic referred to the fan support Slovenia received during its EuroBasket run and said: “You saw the final in Istanbul. They live for us.”FIBA instituted the soccer-style regional qualifying structure largely with the hope that bringing meaningful home games to every country in the competition — as opposed to summer qualifying tournaments at a centralized location — would help increase interest in the sport. It did so, however, knowing that the best players for numerous countries would not be available to participate.For Slovenia and any other nation that fails to qualify for China, earning a spot in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo will be challenging. It will require an invitation to one of four last-chance qualifying tournaments shortly before the Olympics start in 2020. Only the four bracket winners in those tournaments will advance to Tokyo.Doncic acknowledged that leading Slovenia to its first-ever Olympic berth in basketball is one of his major career goals.“Olympics, next EuroBasket, next World Cup — I want to play for the national team whenever I’m available,” Doncic said. “If I don’t have injuries, I’ll play.”"
"The hiring of the W.N.B.A. point guard Kristi Toliver as a full-time assistant coach with the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards while she is still an active player was widely applauded as a notable new achievement for women in coaching.It followed the San Antonio Spurs’ hiring of Becky Hammon, and other women like Nancy Lieberman and Jenny Boucek also joining N.B.A. coaching staffs.“With anything, you need to see it to be it,” said Briann January, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury and, in her off-season, an assistant women’s basketball coach at Arizona State. “I see it now because of Becky. Because of Kristi. I see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional area.”For many players, the moves showed N.B.A. teams tapping into a longstanding, significant pipeline of female talent.“I think a lot of women in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunities in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team, to any organization, no matter our gender,” said Alana Beard, a veteran Los Angeles Sparks guard often mentioned as a coaching candidate by her peers.Beard cited the meager pay Toliver is to receive this season — just $10,000 because of limits in the W.N.B.A.’s collective bargaining agreement — as an “extremely important” issue for the league to address in negotiations for a new agreement. The goal would be making a barrier that has long been permeable on one side — men into women’s basketball on the coaching side — into a free exchange of talent, regardless of gender, based on opportunity.Many, if not most, W.N.B.A. players, who are paid significantly less than their male counterparts, cannot afford to spend their off-season working for so little pay. Their basketball skills are worth much more — into the millions of dollars — in service of women’s leagues overseas.“All of those things on a coach’s plate to take care of, to do that for $10,000 for an entire N.B.A. season is crazy,” January said. “I’d like to break that down and do the math, like how much that is a game or how much that is a day. That would just be insult to injury.”Yet some people, including commentators on internet sites and men’s basketball fans in real life, contend these women should be happy to have opportunities at all.This attitude rankles many W.N.B.A. players — that even Toliver’s shot, let alone chances for other women with considerable experience playing and in many cases coaching, is often thought of as a one-sided benefit for those who are hired.But in many cases, the N.B.A. came calling after seeing the women excelling on their own. Toliver’s work with the Mystics helped bring her to the attention of Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, just as Hammon got her opportunity in San Antonio because she was employed by the Silver Stars, then owned by the same group as the Spurs, and her W.N.B.A. coach, Dan Hughes, talked her up to Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.“I had a chance to put two parties together that I knew would work,” Hughes, now the head coach of the Seattle Storm, said. “I knew Becky, and I also knew Pop, and I knew that Pop, we had a lot of years of conversation about Becky. He had seen her play when I first brought her to San Antonio. So to me it was an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each other.”Toliver has opened up that discussion in significant ways, which she said was a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place. In Hughes’s eyes, it is nothing less than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia has prevented the men’s basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the women’s side of the sport, the next step toward N.B.A. teams and W.N.B.A. teams and men’s and women’s college basketball programs all hiring from the same pool of candidates.As Hughes sees it, it’s time, not because these women deserve a chance, but because every basketball team needs more coaches like Hammon, Toliver and those who will follow.“I want a world someday where people judge coaches on how good a coach they truly are,” Hughes said. “Doesn’t matter if they’re male or female, doesn’t matter their background. They can say he’s a coach or she’s a coach, and we can use them.”Every W.N.B.A. player who stays home instead of playing overseas in her off-season, the athletes said, is potentially one more person around which to promote the league year-round, and that player gets to rest, too. The grind of playing 12 months a year has led to W.N.B.A. players like Diana Taurasi and Angel McCoughtry taking seasons off.“You always want to protect your product,” January said. “And the majority of our product is being run down and beaten up year-round playing this game. So when they come back around to play in the W.N.B.A., you have half of your players injured, playing through nagging things. We still find a way to have a high talent and high level of basketball, which is crazy to me.“We just have some really strong women, but that needs to be a discussion. What can we do to provide other opportunities for women to make income and prepare for the future on a real-life scale? Something they can live on. Something that makes sense.”"
"Seven years ago, Tacko Fall and Christ Koumadje were discovered by basketball scouts in a similar fashion.They were hard to miss.On the streets of Dakar, Senegal, the two 7-footers stood out. They were spotted by employees of the Flying Star Academy, a Senegalese training ground for several basketball players who have ended up on college teams in the United States. The employees chased after the teenagers, imploring them to try their enormous hands at the sport.[Follow our live coverage of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]At the time, Koumadje, now a 7-foot-4 senior at Florida State, preferred soccer. Fall, now a 7-foot-6 senior at Central Florida, was more interested in devouring anime and manga series like “Naruto” and “Tokyo Ghoul.” Both were, at first, indifferent to basketball.But their potential upside was difficult to ignore. To onlookers, they evoked thoughts of the next Hakeem Olajuwon or Yao Ming.Today, their size offers less promise. They toiled to become giant forces in the paint, only to watch as basketball evolved from a game that coveted height into a more freewheeling, 3-point-centric game that deems their skill sets nearly as obsolete as a fax machine: nice to have, but no longer entirely necessary.“What’s interesting about both, their advanced analytics, they play off the charts — well over 1 point per possession, and that’s really effective in college basketball,” said Steve Kyler, the editor and publisher of Basketball Insiders, which produces weekly N.B.A. mock drafts. “When you dig deeper, in situational-type things they grade really well, but the truth of the matter is the N.B.A. game isn’t played that way anymore. It’s all about stretch 5s, quickness.”“I think they may get a look on the fringe based off their size,” Kyler added. “But a guy 7-foot-6 being the first overall pick or top five is pretty rare now.”In the college game, where height can still create a tangible advantage, Fall and Koumadje — who are among the tallest players currently in Division I — will be crucial cogs in their teams’ N.C.A.A. tournament performance.Beyond that, whether they can find a place and purpose in the N.B.A. — where the only active players who stand 7-foot-3 or taller are Dallas’s Kristaps Porzingis, who has a far more diverse skill set, and Philadelphia’s Boban Marjanovic — remains to be seen.“Extending my range is something I definitely want to work on,” said Fall, who helped the Knights earn their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 2005 by averaging nearly 11 points and 7 rebounds a game. “I’m not going to go out there and shoot 3s like a lot of bigs do now, but pick my spots.“But I feel like no matter how the game has changed, you still need somebody down low to do some damage.”Basketball academies in Senegal like Flying Star now regularly send players abroad. After playing for a few months at the academy, Fall got a chance to join a high school team in the United States. His mother reluctantly let her son go, hoping he would receive a better education.Extremely raw when he arrived at Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Fla., Fall almost quit basketball. But he refined his game while playing on a travel team alongside Ben Simmons, now with the Philadelphia 76ers. Fall also trained in Houston with Olajuwon, a Hall of Famer who emphasized the importance of footwork for a center his size.Occasionally, Fall watched Simmons at nearby Montverde Academy, where Koumadje landed after coming to the United States. Fall and Koumadje only briefly overlapped in Dakar — Koumadje is originally from Chad — but in high school they talked on the phone or via Facebook. Their discussions rarely veered into basketball. Instead, they commiserated about the difficulties of adjusting to life when you are over 7 feet tall and 4,500 miles from home.Koumadje, like Fall, grasps the unlikelihood that he will develop into a free-shooting N.B.A. big man. Before his senior year in high school, he played pickup games at the University of Southern California with Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons. It was then, Koumadje said, that he realized he was more effective cemented in the post.“The game is evolving and that’s what people want,” said Koumadje, a two-year starter who led the Seminoles in blocked shots this season. “But I play to my strength. That’s what I do.”Fall’s turning point came after his sophomore season at Central Florida, when he contemplated entering the 2017 N.B.A. draft. Five teams told him he needed vast improvement adapting to the speed of the pros, particularly in guarding pick-and-rolls.Central Florida Coach Johnny Dawkins — a former Duke guard who played with the towering centers Shawn Bradley and Manute Bol in the N.B.A. — was hired before Fall’s sophomore year, and created a three-year plan for him. Increasing mobility and stamina came first, followed by catching the ball down low and learning to work out of double and triple teams. This season, Dawkins has moved Fall farther out on the perimeter defensively.Wherever he stands, Fall often forces opposing players to elevate more when they shoot, to get the ball over his arms.“Our floaters have to be a little bit higher, and it probably screwed a couple of guys up,” Fran Dunphy, Temple’s coach at the time, said after a game against Central Florida on March 9.Teams have tried less inventive strategies to bypass Fall’s 8-foot-4 wingspan. Fall, who is bulkier than Bol or Bradley, said that he had heard opposing coaches tell players to go after his knees.Though he is all but assured of breaking the Division I record for career field-goal percentage — he currently shoots over 74 percent; the record is 67.8 — Fall converts only 36 percent of his free throws. Fall — whose hands are 10½ inches long — said that when he shoots free throws it feels as if he is holding a volleyball.His shooting form, which involves using only his right hand while flinging his left arm in the air and then slouching, has drawn derisive comments on social media, where he is sometimes treated as a sideshow. After Fall had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Houston that ended the Cougars' 33-game home winning streak, Fall got more attention for a GIF that showed him holding the ball over an opponent’s head like an older brother playing keep-away.Fall and Koumadje are accustomed to stares in airports and snide remarks from opposing fans. While both harbor N.B.A. dreams — neither appears in most mock drafts — they also envision a life beyond basketball, when their height won’t dictate how others perceive them.Koumadje said he would eventually like to work for the United Nations, helping refugees in Chad. Fall wants to become an engineer.“Basketball’s opened a lot of doors for me, but there’s more to me than the ball, the hoop,” Fall said. “I definitely don’t want to be defined by that. I definitely don’t want to be seen as an attraction, either.”"
"SACRAMENTO — The Boston Celtics were not in a good place when they boarded a plane bound for California on Sunday. They were coming off a home loss to the Houston Rockets that point guard Kyrie Irving punctuated by using a total of 43 words to answer nine questions in his postgame news conference.At one point, he was asked whether he thought the team could cobble together some momentum on its West Coast trip.“We’ll see,” he whispered.Just one season removed from a run to the N.B.A.’s Eastern Conference finals, and seemingly improved by the re-addition of Gordon Hayward and the continued development of their young core, the Celtics were on the brink of falling apart. Any hope they still harbored of being a championship-ready team was as brittle as a toothpick.But after some reflection and conversation, the Celtics regained a bit of their swagger with back-to-back wins this week against the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. The Celtics will see if they can keep the good vibes going on Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers, which is anything but certain, especially for Irving, whose season has been clouded by questions about his future with the team.Such uncertainty does not make Irving unique in the modern N.B.A. — Kevin Durant of the Warriors and Kawhi Leonard of the Toronto Raptors are among the other stars who will weigh big decisions in free agency this summer — but the Celtics have let the noise affect them.With the two wins this week improving their record to 40-26, the Celtics may be showing signs that they are finally, mercifully, learning how to cope.“That long plane ride helped us out,” Irving said after Tuesday’s lopsided victory over the Warriors. “I’ll just say that. We needed it. We needed it. We were going to get to a point where we were just going to get tired of fighting each other, fighting the outside world when it doesn’t really matter. So we just wanted to come out here and play basketball.“This is our sanctuary, and we have to do everything we can to protect it. We can’t let anyone infiltrate it.”Irving, who missed Wednesday’s win against the Kings with a left thigh contusion, is averaging a team-leading 23.4 points a game along with 7 assists and 4.9 rebounds, both career highs. He is also shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from 3-point range.He also ranks among the N.B.A. leaders in mercurial behavior. He has been vague about the specific source of his discontent, but it may have something to do with his pending free agency.Irving backed off an earlier pledge to re-sign with the Celtics after they struggled at the start of the season. In fact, during a trip to New York to play the Knicks on Feb. 1, he told a group of reporters in his own colorfully abrasive way that he did not owe anyone anything. The Knicks, of course, would be interested in signing Irving, a six-time All-Star who grew up in New Jersey and has a soft spot for Madison Square Garden.Then came the All-Star break, and a clip of Irving and Durant having an inaudible conversation found its way to the internet, where an army of amateur lip readers tried to decode what they were saying. Worth noting: Irving and Durant are close friends. Also worth noting: The Knicks will have enough cap space this summer for two max contracts.Irving refused to shed light on their chat, and said it was nobody’s business, which was his prerogative. But it had the general effect of using a napkin to mop up an oil spill.Since then, Irving has been alluding to nefarious forces and the steep cost of celebrity, saying he hates the spotlight — even as he sells sneakers and moonlights as an actor. He reiterated his disdain this week after collecting 19 points and 11 assists against the Warriors, his 17th double-double this season.“The business part of it is just what makes it terrible for me — honestly, dealing with all this,” he said, referring to the reporters around him. “I’m going to be honest with you guys: The basketball part of it? I have to keep that fun. That’s where I’m great. Being around my teammates, that’s what makes me happy. And the business part of it is going to be business.”It was not lost on anyone who witnessed this exchange that Irving was bashing the business of basketball while wearing an Uncle Drew ball cap — the same Uncle Drew character he popularized in soft drink commercials and then parlayed into a movie released last year.As for the basketball itself, well, Boston has had an uneven season, the product of a team that is not nearly Lakers-level dysfunctional but is not exactly cohesive, either. The Celtics arrived for their game against the Warriors having lost five of their last six games, and their locker room was a joyless place.Perhaps they needed to get away from Boston. Perhaps they needed perspective. Perhaps Irving needed to speak with Danny Ainge, the team’s president of basketball operations, and Brad Stevens, its coach, who reminded Irving that the team still had a lot of season left to play. It was not over, not yet, not by any stretch.“Every team has to find a togetherness in competing,” Stevens said. “Some teams, it takes 60 games. Some teams, it takes 20 games. And bad teams never get there. We hope that it took us 60 games, but we’ll see. We haven’t proven ourselves to be great at that yet for a long stretch of time.”In their 128-95 win against the Warriors, the Celtics had 38 assists on 49 field goals. They also communicated. When Irving and forward Jaylen Brown botched a play that led to an early turnover, Brown patted himself on the chest to apologize, then appeared to apologize a second time on their next trip up the court.The next night, in Sacramento, Irving sat behind the visiting bench for the Celtics’ 111-109 victory over the Kings. He was vocal. He did a lot of fist-pumping. And he celebrated when Hayward, less than 24 hours after scoring 30 points against the Warriors, connected on the game-winner.After suffering a grisly ankle injury in the opening game and missing last season, Hayward has struggled to find a rhythm in his return. Maybe he found it here in California, along with the rest of the team. The Celtics are too talented to let this opportunity go to waste, because who knows how long it will last?“As long as my teammates are feeling good,” Irving said, “then we’re in a good place.”"
"HOUSTON — DeMarcus Cousins used to watch soap operas with his grandmother when he was growing up. She would refer to them as her “stories,” he said, and “As the World Turns” was her favorite. Cousins could never fully relate to the absurd drama of his grandmother’s stories until this season, when he joined the Golden State Warriors.“Every episode it was something,” he said. “And that’s what this has turned into.”Cousins is sometimes an innocent bystander. (Consider the midseason beef between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green that stemmed from a late-game meltdown against the Los Angeles Clippers and bled into Durant’s impending free agency.) But sometimes Cousins is involved, even if it is not his choice. He was aware, for example, before Wednesday’s game against the Houston Rockets, that members of the news media and the general public were picking apart his defense and referring to him as a liability.“We all been in this business long enough to know how it goes,” said Cousins, a 6-foot-11 center. “And I’ve been around this team to know how things go around here. You’re always looking for something to make a story. I mean, I could care less. You all got to do your jobs, and I got to do mine.”For all the laments about Cousins’s vulnerability in pick-and-roll defensive situations, there is no denying his offensive impact when he is focused, and he was supremely focused against the Rockets on Wednesday night, collecting 27 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 106-104 victory that infused the team with some positive vibes.Scoring down low, passing out of the post, setting meaty screens — Cousins does things that the Warriors have seldom featured in their four-plus seasons of dominance.“For as long as we can remember, we haven’t had a guy we can just throw the ball to in the post and work around him,” Stephen Curry said.It is still a process, of course, both for the Warriors, who are working to incorporate another mammoth personality into their fold as they pursue a third straight championship, and for Cousins, a four-time All-Star who spent the first few months of the season building strength and working on his conditioning as he recovered from an Achilles’ tendon tear.Since Cousins made his season debut on Jan. 18, the Warriors are 15-7. But they had lost six of their last 10 games entering Wednesday, and the general mood of the team felt flat. Curry likened it to when Durant joined the Warriors in 2016, and the team spent the first two or three months of the season trying to find its rhythm.“There was a little sensitivity to how everybody was going to get their shots,” Curry said. “At the end of the day, we’re all talented and we all have high basketball I.Q.s, so just let things happen. You don’t have to force anything. We’ve been good at it at times, and not so good at other times. So it’s just a matter of sticking with the program.”After sinking 11 of 16 shots against the Rockets, Cousins acknowledged that it was the best he had felt since he made his return.“I think it’s coming,” Cousins said. “We’ve had stretches where it’s kind of flowing for everybody. But this is a team that’s been together for a while, and they’re used to playing a certain type of way. So for me to just come in — I’m not expecting this team to adjust to me. Obviously, I have to adjust to them.”Durant missed the game with a sprained ankle, which meant that Cousins had more playmaking opportunities than usual. Coach Steve Kerr made some adjustments, too, staggering Cousins and Green for stretches so that each had more room to operate in the middle of the court. Kerr has also been advising his players to pump the brakes in transition.“Sometimes we’ve played a little too fast and shot too many quick shots instead of letting him get down on the block and controlling things,” Kerr said, referring to Cousins. He added: “I think we’ve got to remind ourselves that this is still early in the process. We’re all learning. Me too. I’ve got to learn to use him better.”If Cousins still appears to labor at times (or most of the time) to get overly airborne, his confidence seems fine.“I don’t think anyone can stop me one on one, period,” he said. “So you can put whoever you want on me.”The Warriors and the Rockets have history. In last season’s Western Conference finals, Houston had a 3-2 series lead against Golden State, but Chris Paul injured his hamstring in Game 5. The Rockets lost the final two games of the series without him, and the Warriors went on to successfully defend their N.B.A. championship.Cousins was not involved in that series, but he is a part of the dynamic now — and the Warriors are not quite finished preparing themselves for the postseason. Andrew Bogut, a defense-minded center who last played for Golden State in 2016, is expected to join the team in the coming days after an M.V.P. season with the Sydney Kings of Australia’s National Basketball League. Kerr recently described Bogut as “an insurance policy in the frontcourt.”Yes, the league’s most compelling drama is about to welcome the return of a former cast member. For his part, Cousins said he would continue to focus on the only role he knows.“I just want to play basketball,” he said."
"Kenny Anderson, a celebrated point guard from Queens who had a 14-year N.B.A. career, was hospitalized over the weekend after suffering a stroke.Lina Catalfamo Plath, a family spokeswoman, said via email that Anderson was recovering. Plath also released a statement from Anderson’s wife, Natasha.“We would like to thank everyone for reaching out on behalf of Kenny,” Natasha Anderson said in the statement. “Our family is extremely grateful for all the prayers and love that we have received over the last few days. We appreciate you continuing to respect our privacy as Kenny heals.”Anderson, 48, recently concluded his first season as the men’s basketball coach at Fisk University, a historically black school in Nashville that plays at the N.A.I.A. level.As a high school player at Archbishop Molloy, a powerhouse program in Queens, Anderson was one of the most prolific and high-profile players in the city’s rich basketball history. A McDonald’s All-American, Anderson set what was then a state scoring record with 2,621 points before enrolling at Georgia Tech, where he helped the team reach the Final Four in 1990.After Anderson spent two seasons at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the second overall pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft — Larry Johnson went first to the Charlotte Hornets — and Anderson enjoyed a productive career that never quite lived up to the hype that had followed him since he was a teenager. He averaged 12.6 points and 6.1 assists a game while playing for nine teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Portland Trail Blazers, and was an All-Star selection for the Nets in 1994.A 2017 documentary on Anderson called “Mr. Chibbs” detailed many of his personal struggles, including bankruptcy and depression. In 2014, he traveled to North Korea as a member of the team that Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls forward, cobbled together at the invitation of Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader.“My mistakes weren’t really mistakes,” Anderson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. “It was being young and living and learning. Yes, I spent a lot of money; I went through a lot of money. I had some failed marriages — if you want to criticize me for that. You can’t cry about your mishaps. I count my blessings, I don’t count my mishaps.”"
"Mike Bibby, the former N.B.A. player, is being investigated by the police over accusations of sexual abuse.Mr. Bibby, now a high school basketball coach in Arizona, was accused by a teacher who works at the same school, The Arizona Republic reported. The episode that prompted the accusations was said to have taken place in 2017.The Republic, citing a restraining order granted last week, said that Mr. Bibby had been accused of grabbing the teacher by the waist and pulling her into a car, then groping her and rubbing his genitals on her. After the woman left the car, the order said, he followed her and made sexual remarks. The woman said she did not know Mr. Bibby before the incident.The restraining order quoted the teacher as saying she was “in shock, in fear, intimidated by his actions, afraid of him as he smelled of alcohol.”A lawyer for Mr. Bibby denied the accusations.“I can say with pretty much certainty this alleged incident didn’t happen and that will be shown down the road,” Donald Harris, Mr. Bibby’s lawyer, told The Republic. “Michael Bibby did not participate in a sexual assault of any way, shape or form that was alleged by this lady two years ago.”Mr. Bibby recently coached the boys’ basketball team to a fourth straight state championship at the school, Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix. He is also an alumnus of Shadow Mountain, and won a state championship as a player in the 1990s before attending the University of Arizona, where he won a national championship in 1997. He retired from the N.B.A. in 2012 after a 14-year career with six teams, most notably the Vancouver Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks. He spent his last season with the Knicks, playing 39 games after signing as a free agent in December 2011.For the past two summers, Mr. Bibby, 40, played with the Ghost Ballers of the Big3, a professional 3-on-3 basketball league founded by the rapper Ice Cube."
"Cal Ramsey, a presence on the New York basketball scene for more than a half-century, who starred at New York University in the 1950s, played briefly for the Knicks and remained with them as a longtime broadcaster and community relations representative, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 81.The Knicks announced his death, at a rehabilitation center. He had been in poor health in recent years.Ramsey, who had lived in Harlem since he was young, began honing his skills on the playground courts of the Rucker League, which has attracted some of the game’s greatest players over the years.He first appeared at Madison Square Garden while playing for Commerce High School of Manhattan. He played at the Garden for three seasons as a forward at N.Y.U., where he was a teammate of the future Boston Celtic forward Tom Sanders. He is 11th on the leading scorers list for N.Y.U. with 1,275 points.Ramsey was selected in the second round of the 1959 N.B.A. draft by the St. Louis Hawks. At 6 feet 4 inches, he was an outstanding rebounder with a good shooting touch, but he came to be considered too small as a forward and not good enough as a dribbler to excel at guard.He played in only four games with the Hawks and seven with the Knicks in the 1959-60 season, then in two games with the Syracuse Nationals, the forerunners of the Philadelphia 76ers, in 1960-61.Ramsey may have faced another obstacle in the N.B.A. that had little to do with his skills. “I’ve been told at the time there was a quota system in the league,” in which teams “may have wanted only two or three blacks,” Ramsey told Charles Salzberg for the oral history “From Set Shot to Slam Dunk” (1987).After Ramsey’s stint with Syracuse, he went to the semipro Eastern League but incurred a severe knee injury in his third season with the circuit. It ended his playing career.Ramsey was born on July 13, 1937, in Selma, Ala. He was a teacher in New York after his playing days, having received a bachelor’s degree from N.Y.U.He was a color analyst for Knicks broadcasts from 1972 to 1982, then rejoined the team as a community representative in 1991. He was also an assistant basketball coach at N.Y.U., which had become a Division III team, from 1983 until the past season. He served N.Y.U. as assistant director of community relations for 20 years and received the N.Y.U. President’s Alumni Achievement Award in 2004.Information on his survivors was not immediately available.James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, said in a statement that Ramsey “will be remembered for the thousands of young lives he influenced as a community leader.”A case in point involved Al Barden, who, after starring for Boys High School in Brooklyn (now Boys and Girls), was recruited to N.Y.U. by Ramsey while he was playing there.“Al was a tough kid with a habit of getting into some trouble,” Ramsey told Harvey Araton of The New York Times in 2009. “So I stayed on him, made sure he was going to class, doing the things he needed to stay eligible.”When Barden’s basketball career was over, Ramsey, mindful of the problems athletes have in transitioning to a new phase of life, hired Barden as his replacement to direct a high school program for at-risk students. They remained friends through the years.One day, Barden, living in California, phoned Ramsey to tell him of the birth of his son, whom he had named Ramses, ostensibly for the pharaohs of ancient Egypt as a symbol of everlasting strength.But there was more to it than that.“Replace the ‘s’ with a ‘y’ and what does it spell?” Barden asked Ramsey. “I really named him for you.”In June 2009, the Giants selected Ramses Barden, a receiver from Cal Poly, in the third round of the N.F.L. draft, and he spent four seasons with them.When Ramses was drafted, Al Barden, speaking to The Times, said of Cal Ramsey, “He could get you to do anything just because of who he was: someone you just had to respect.”"
"LONDON — In theory at least, we understand the words on the sports radio we hear incessantly — in taxis, at the fish and chips place, at the corner newsstand. But we are foreigners here and the stories are inscrutable, full of happenings from cricket ovals and rugby pitches.Our sports focus is confined to our darkened living room, where my 7-year-old son, Leo, and I have lately been absorbing improbable happenings from the other side of the Atlantic — one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty Brooklyn Nets.This has become our early-morning ritual. Wife and daughter still asleep, the boys watch the action from the night before, the scores carefully hidden from our N.B.A. League Pass app lest we ruin the ending.We are basketball expatriates, two steps removed from the initial source of my N.B.A. obsession by a change of team loyalties and a move to London.In our North London surroundings, we may as well be rooting for a badminton team from Bhutan. While the odd LeBron James jersey can be spotted, our Brooklyn Nets gear seemingly fades into the sea of Yankees caps brought home by tourists returning from New York (oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this Mets fan) and the endless Brooklyn-related mumbo jumbo that now adorns T-shirts worldwide.[Nets’ Run to the Playoffs Hits a Snag With Spencer Dinwiddie Injury]While N.F.L. gear is a common sighting, owing to the constant staging of American football games here, N.B.A. basketball is largely invisible. One imagines this was unaltered by the recent showdown of two of the league’s most dreadful teams, the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, inside London’s unlovable O2 arena. (We did not attend, just as we do not take leisure trips to see the dentist.)Our sports-related conversations with Britons tend to revolve around the astronomical ticket prices required to see Arsenal, the English Premier League soccer team Leo has decided that we love forever. Our Nets fandom is like membership in a secret society, whose disclosure would mark us as eccentric and produce puzzlement.Even my Knick fan friends back in New York do not want to hear about the Nets via email. My only real communion comes via obscure Nets-related podcasts I listen to while washing the dishes. When Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe devoted perhaps 3 minutes of a recent pod to the Nets surge, I confess to feelings of pride and validation I can only liken to a U.F.O. conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer.My embrace of the Nets began seven years ago when the Knicks — the only team I had ever rooted for — shunned a gift from the basketball gods by letting Jeremy Lin leave town. It was the final indignity after years of atrocious basketball. I dumped my Knicks season tickets and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my Brooklyn neighborhood.I did not do so lightly. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I saw abandoning a team as a serious breach of the tribal code. I disdained fans from other cities who rooted for two teams in the same sport. I was unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all: the bandwagon fan. (If that Steph Curry jersey you own was the first Warriors gear in your closet, yes, I’m talking about you.)But I was hopping on no bandwagon. With the exception of a pair of distant trips to the N.B.A. finals, the New Jersey-turned-Brooklyn Nets were a pathetic franchise. I was living in Brooklyn. My father had grown up in Queens and traveled on a streetcar to watch the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. I was not abandoning my tribe. I was returning to it.This is what I told myself as I began reading about the odd collection of players I was now rooting for, trying to divine the narrative that would make it real. I fought through a sense of exile in the slick, new Barclays Center, which was full of fans for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool Brooklyn food, the dancing during timeouts, and whatever fascinating things were happening on their phones.Yes, it was a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff. The season tickets I bought the day the Knicks said goodbye to J-Lin put me in seats that were a 10-minute walk from my house in Prospect Heights. Madison Square Garden was a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowels of Penn Station.Yet there was something about the Garden, even as the Dolan era yielded a lost decade of basketball. The crowd understood. Hustle plays drew appreciation in an arena that had revered Charles Oakley. The energy was electric.In Brooklyn, the mostly mercenary fans got what we deserved: a team of past-their-prime castoffs imported by the bombastic Russian magnate, Mikhail Prokhorov, who had brought the franchise to Brooklyn. Vowing to spend whatever it took to eclipse the Knicks — a low bar — he built a bonfire of money at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic.In came the wildly overpaid Joe Johnson, a seven-time All-Star. In came the mediocre Gerald Wallace in exchange for a first-round pick that Portland turned into Damian Lillard. The centerpiece was the sullen, out-of-shape Deron Williams who, in another lifetime, looked like the best point guard on earth, and whose passions no longer appeared to include basketball.They fit uneasily around the likable 7-footer, Brook Lopez, whose sweet shooting came along with rebounding and defensive skills that seemed better suited for other pursuits, like calligraphy.My history as a Knicks fan made the plan feel familiar. Win now, baby! The future was for losers. The oligarch was buying his way to competitiveness pronto. Leaving no doubt, the Nets soon traded every first-round pick until the sun dies for the remains of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.When it all unraveled and the Nets descended into an unwatchable state, I hung in. You can not renounce the team of your life and then walk away from your new one because they are terrible. Real fandom is forged in suffering. Even when my family traded Brooklyn for London in 2016, we remained Nets fans.This happily coincided with another development: The Nets bucked the conventional wisdom that New York fans will not accept rebuilding and embraced patience.Sean Marks, the general manager, somehow turned a collection of mostly indifferent veterans into a raffish crew of young, hungry players led by a first-time head coach, Kenny Atkinson. They run at a ferocious pace, share the ball with grace, and play with joy.Since an excruciating eight-game losing streak, the Nets have won 18 of 23. Even from afar, we can tell that the intensity has changed at the Barclays, the Brooook-Lyyyyn chants filling our London living room.And still, an intense New York team deserves better. Back for the holidays, I took Leo to see New Orleans and their marquee star, Anthony Davis, at Barclays. The place was packed with tourists who seemed intent on taking selfies and buying Brooklyn gear at the swag shop.Whatever.On Saturday morning, we will sit on the couch in our pajamas, Leo and me, and see what happened against the now-hated, if pitiful, Knicks the night before.Please don’t tell us who won."
"Louisiana State suspended its head men’s basketball coach, Will Wade, on Friday — less than two weeks before the N.C.A.A. tournament is set to begin — after a report that Wade made damning remarks to a recruiting middleman on a phone call that was wiretapped as part of a federal corruption investigation.Wade spoke with Christian Dawkins, who was convicted of fraud last year for his connection in a scheme to funnel money to the families of basketball recruits, in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. In the conversation, according to a report on Thursday by Yahoo Sports, Wade was heard boasting in colorful language that he had made a strong offer to one recruit but that he had not yet committed because someone else in his life was not getting “enough piece of the pie in the deal.”A source with knowledge of the call, who declined to be identified because the trial is continuing, confirmed the report on Friday.The No. 10 Tigers (25-5) are having their best season in decades and are considered shoo-ins for an N.C.A.A. tournament bid. They host Vanderbilt on Saturday night before next week’s Southeastern Conference tournament in Nashville.“All of us at L.S.U. share the obligation to protect the integrity of this institution,” said the university’s president, F. King Alexander, and its athletic director, Joe Alleva, in a statement. “As such, we have suspended Head Coach Will Wade indefinitely until such time as we can ensure full compliance with the N.C.A.A., as well as institutional policies and standards.”Alexander and Alleva pledged full cooperation with the N.C.A.A. and said an assistant coach, Tony Benford, would be interim head coach.When confronted with the report on Thursday by a local television station, Wade declined to comment.Dawkins was convicted of fraud after a trial last year, alongside Jim Gatto, the former director of global sports marketing for Adidas, and Merl Code Jr., who had also worked for Adidas. After a yearslong investigation involving a cooperating witness, undercover agents and wiretaps, prosecutors said the men had conspired to funnel Adidas money to the family of a top basketball player who would play for Louisville, one of the most prominent teams the apparel giant sponsors.But prosecutors also accused Dawkins and Code of involvement in bribing assistant coaches at top programs. In a trial set to begin next month, three assistant coaches have pleaded guilty, but Dawkins and Code are also defendants and, following sentencing in the first trial on Tuesday, their lawyers pledged to fight prosecutors on the facts and summon college coaches to testify.When the charges were first announced, in September 2017, they swiftly led to the firings of Louisville’s athletic director and Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino. Several assistant coaches charged also lost their jobs. Arizona Coach Sean Miller was suspended for a game after a report that he was on tape discussing with Dawkins the payment of $100,000 to a top recruit, but he and the university denied the charge and he was reinstated. Evidence at last year’s trial indicated that Miller did have phone calls with Dawkins.“The information in recent news reports is very disturbing, if true,” the SEC commissioner, Greg Sankey, said in a statement on Friday. “Considering the existing circumstances, L.S.U. has taken appropriate action today while the investigation continues.”"
"An Alabama girl’s banishment from high school basketball came to an end on Friday morning when a circuit court judge accomplished what appeals to state boards and outcries from some of the most prominent voices in sports could not.After the parents of Maori Davenport filed a motion on Thursday to get their daughter back on the basketball court, Judge Sonny Reagan of Pike County Circuit Court ruled that Davenport could return to competition pending a hearing. He will decide whether she deserved to be ruled ineligible for accepting a mistaken payment from the sport’s national governing body for playing on a junior national team last summer.The effect will be almost immediate. Davenport, 18, a star forward at Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Ala., was set to play with her team on Friday night against Carroll High School.Last season, Davenport averaged 18.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.2 blocks a game in leading Charles Henderson to the Alabama Class 5A state title. The year before, in a losing effort in the state title game, she had 20 points and 25 rebounds and swatted away 19 shots, an Alabama state record. She has committed to play at Rutgers.Her athletic eligibility became a cause célèbre in the past week. On Nov. 30, Davenport, a 6-foot-4 forward, was called into her principal’s office and told that the Alabama High School Athletic Association had ruled her ineligible for one year, her senior season.The suspension was not for poor grades or unsportsmanlike conduct. It was because of a clerical error that U.S.A. Basketball, the sport’s national governing body, readily admitted to having made, and the decision to suspend her became one of the more mind-boggling stories for those who follow amateur sports.“That was very heartbreaking for me,” Davenport said this week of the suspension. “The only thing I could think is that I was in shock and devastated.”The trouble began harmlessly enough over the summer, when Davenport represented the United States at the FIBA Under-18 Women’s Americas Championship in Mexico City. She led the team in rebounding and blocks as it won gold.U.S.A. Basketball compensates players who compete on national teams to make up for wages they could have earned working summer jobs rather than practicing or competing. The N.C.A.A. allows college athletes to accept those payments. It calls them broken-time payments.For players with high school eligibility remaining, U.S.A. Basketball typically inquires with individual state high school athletics associations to see if the payments can be accepted. Policies can vary by state.In this case, because of what Craig Miller, a spokesman for U.S.A. Basketball, termed a clerical error, nobody checked with the state high school athletic associations for the three players on the under-18 team with high school eligibility remaining. U.S.A. Basketball sent checks for $857.20 to Davenport and every other player on the team. On Aug. 27, Mario Davenport, Maori’s father, received it. Two days later, she cashed it.Two months later, U.S.A. Basketball realized the error. In November, an employee called the Alabama athletics association, which told the U.S.A. Basketball employee that under Alabama rules, athletes could accept broken-time payments only if the value was less than $200. On Nov. 26, a U.S.A. Basketball official called Davenport’s mother, Tara Davenport, and informed her that Maori was not allowed to accept the stipend. The next day, Tara Davenport reported the violation to the state association and informed Charles Henderson High School officials, and on Nov. 28 she repaid U.S.A. Basketball.Two days later, the state ruled Davenport ineligible for the rest of the season. Two appeals boards have upheld the ruling.On Wednesday afternoon, Tara Davenport said she hoped attention from the news media, as well as pressure from Alabama politicians, would convince the association to change the ruling. The Alabama House Republican Caucus unanimously approved a resolution supporting Maori Davenport, and its members were among the many local politicians supporting her. If the association’s officials were unwilling to change their ruling, Tara Davenport was prepared to take the next step.“If they don’t, we are definitely going to take some legal action to try to help get her on the court,” she said. The next day, she and Mario Davenport filed a lawsuit in Pike County Circuit Court seeking their daughter’s reinstatement.Since Maori Davenport’s final appeal was denied in December, attention and pressure had been building.The story gained national attention recently after Jay Bilas, an ESPN college basketball analyst who was once called “the N.C.A.A.’s most dangerous critic,” wrote a column blistering Steve Savarese, the executive director for the state athletic association. Bilas accused Savarese of “blindly asserting authority without regard for whom it may hurt, or the reasonable likelihood of a similar issue recurring in the future.” On Thursday, the tennis legend Billie Jean King joined the N.B.A. star DeMarcus Cousins and a chorus of others in voicing their support for the player.The association did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the judge’s ruling, and earlier in the week it declined to make Savarese available for an interview. On Tuesday, Johnny Hardin, the president of the association’s Central Board of Control — which heard and denied Davenport’s final appeal — released a statement asserting that “facts involved in the ruling have either been misstated or ignored.”According to Brock Kelley, the Charles Henderson High School principal, it is the association’s facts that are misleading.Hardin’s statement says that Tara Davenport is a certified basketball coach and therefore should know the eligibility rules. Kelley wrote in an email that Tara Davenport, who is a fifth-grade teacher, coaches middle school basketball, for which there is no rules test. Hardin’s statement says Kelley has not attended an association rules conference for the past three years. Kelley wrote that his school’s athletic director had attended each one and that the amateurism rule had not been covered at the last meeting.Tara Davenport emphasized that neither she nor her daughter had hidden the check. They simply thought that U.S.A. Basketball had done its due diligence and that they could accept it.“I reported it as soon as I knew that Maori wasn’t supposed to have it,” she said.Kelley, the high school principal, and Miller, the U.S.A. Basketball spokesman, focused on how institutionalized the payments are. After U.S.A. Basketball sent the check but before Tara Davenport received it, Kelley wrote, she received a call from Jeff Walz. Walz is the women’s basketball coach at the University of Louisville and was also the coach of the United States under-18 team. Walz asked Tara Davenport if she had received the check yet. She said she had not and asked whether Maori could accept it. Walz told her that she was allowed to and that it was permitted by the N.C.A.A.Louisville officials did not respond to a request to comment.In Maori Davenport’s absence, the Charles Henderson girls basketball team has won all but two games and is the top-ranked 5A team in the state. Davenport is attending school, going to practices and working on her game with an outside trainer. She said she was focusing on ball-handling skills and other drills that would allow her to play more as a wing.On Friday night, she will get her first opportunity to show off those newly developed skills in a competitive game."
"The woman who has accused Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Justin E. Fairfax, of raping her said that a former N.B.A. player, Corey Maggette, raped her at Duke University 20 years ago and that school officials did not pursue the claim, according to a childhood friend of the woman and Facebook messages the woman exchanged with another friend.Mr. Maggette, who attended Duke for one year, 1998-99, and reached the national championship game, played in the N.B.A. until 2013 and has since worked as a television analyst for Fox Sports.Mr. Maggette denied the accusation through a spokesman Monday evening. “It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson’s lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations,” Mr. Maggette said in a statement. “I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge.”A spokeswoman for Fox Sports West, where Mr. Maggette is a basketball analyst, said in an email, “Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter. We have no further comment at this time.”Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer for the woman who accused Mr. Maggette and Mr. Fairfax, Meredith Watson, said in a statement Friday that Ms. Watson had been raped by a Duke basketball player during her sophomore year but did not name the player. Ms. Smith also said that Ms. Watson had reported her rape to an unspecified dean at the university, but that the dean had “discouraged her from pursuing the claim further.”Duke has acknowledged it is investigating an allegation that a player raped the woman, but a spokesman for the university declined to comment on the identity of the player or the assertion that the university failed to act on the accusation.“We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed,” said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke. “We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time.”Years before Ms. Watson came forward as the second woman to publicly accuse Mr. Fairfax of sexual assault, inflaming a political crisis in Virginia, she told multiple friends that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette, according to one of those friends and Facebook messages exchanged with another.R. Stanton Jones, a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington who grew up with Ms. Watson in Baltimore, said she told him that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette. She told Mr. Jones about it while he and Ms. Watson were both home for the summer in 2001, he said.“Meredith told me she had been raped twice at Duke,” Mr. Jones said. “And she told me that one of the men who raped her was the Duke basketball player Corey Maggette. That was a name I knew because I’m a basketball fan.”Mr. Jones, who did not attend Duke, said he had not had much contact with Ms. Watson in the last decade “other than occasionally liking a Facebook post.” He said he was coming forward now because it “seemed like the right thing to do.”The longtime coach of Duke’s men’s basketball team, Mike Krzyzewski, said after his team’s victory against Virginia on Saturday night that he had “no knowledge” of the situation and that he had learned of it only from news media reports Friday.Karen Kessler, a spokeswoman for Ms. Watson, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Ms. Watson and a friend from March 2017. Ms. Kessler declined to identify the friend, whose name was blacked out in the messages, and The Times was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the messages.In the messages, Ms. Watson expressed disgust at a newspaper article written about Mr. Fairfax, who had already announced his bid for lieutenant governor. After the friend asked Ms. Watson whether she had reported the rape, Ms. Watson responded: “You know I didn’t report it after how the university responded when I reported Corey Maggette.”Ms. Kessler said that after being discouraged by the dean, Ms. Watson decided not to report her accusation to the police.Mr. Krzyzewski — who is in his 39th season coaching the Blue Devils and is college basketball’s leader in wins — and Duke have held themselves up not only as consummate winners but as moral exemplars.No Duke player under Mr. Krzyzewski was kicked off the team until early 2015, when a player was dismissed for unspecified struggles to meet “necessary obligations.” The university’s student newspaper, The Duke Chronicle, reported that the player, Rasheed Sulaimon, had been accused of sexual assault by two students, allegations the athletics department had been aware of as early as 10 months before terminating his participation with the team. (Sulaimon was not charged, and later played for Maryland.)"
"I was 8 years old when my parents — both graduate students from India — moved from married student housing to a little home in Raleigh, N.C., with a basketball hoop in the backyard. Even as an immigrant from South Asia, I knew what that hoop meant.Basketball is a religion in North Carolina, and I quickly became a disciple. When I was 11, the N.C. State Wolfpack won the N.C.A.A. championship in heart-stopping fashion. I still remember my dad taking me to the center of campus for the midnight celebration and being transfixed by the sheer size and emotion of it.My love for the game soon became an obsession. I taught myself to shoot in the backyard and played against the neighborhood kids. I learned to make up for my disadvantages on the court — both real (I’m definitely undersized) and perceived (no one expected a short Indian kid to be any good) — through hustle and perfecting a low left-handed heave that I used whenever I could beat my man into the lane.My crowning achievement came in the final seconds of a Little League championship game, when I went to the free-throw line with my team down a point. Both shots clanked around the rim but went in.In college, watching the sport became equally addictive — especially now that I was at UNC-Chapel Hill. My senior year, the Tar Heels won their fourth N.C.A.A. Championship.Now, at age 47, I am a New York City dad who watches Carolina basketball obsessively with his three sons and who, after a 15 year hiatus (thanks to a couple of knee surgeries) decided to play pickup again. But on the court recently, I came to a shocking realization.My ugly but effective left-handed heave was no longer effective. I had become the player in the pickup game who everyone leaves open from a distance.Call it ego, but I really didn’t want to be that guy. So I turned to the only expert I knew — my 10-year-old son’s basketball coach.Macky Bergman, 35, runs Steady Buckets, a nonprofit that teaches more than 1,000 boys and girls from around the city. Coach Macky, as everyone calls him, is a product of New York City basketball — he was a star player at Bronx Science and played four years at the University of Rochester. He assured me that anyone could learn to shoot if they put the time in.But could a middle-aged, undersized father of three really remake his jump shot and become a solid pickup basketball player again?Coach Macky and I met in early October on a typical outdoor court — fenced-in blacktop, metal backboards, rims with no nets — on Second Avenue and 19th Street. It was 8 a.m. on a weekday, so the place was vacant, except for a grousing tenant who lived near the court and asked us to practice as far away from his home as possible. This somewhat safe space meant I could relax a little, although the pressure was still on, as both Macky and the Times photographer, sent to track my progress, were both former college players.We began with a shooting test: a series of midrange and 3-point jumpers while moving between five spots on the court. I did this 10 times, shooting 10 free throws after each round. By the end I was drenched in sweat.The results weren’t great — 62 percent from the free-throw line, 49 percent on 2-point jumpers and an abysmal 30 percent from the 3-point line. As for my self-taught shooting technique, which even my son, Kavi, had described as “pretty ugly,” Coach Macky decided we would have to start over from scratch.In our first few sessions, we set about erasing the muscle memory of 1983 to develop proper form. We started as close to the basket as possible — almost directly under the rim.The ball was to be perched just above my eyes, on the fingertips of my left hand, directly underneath the right angle at the bend of my elbow. My guide hand would hold the right side of the ball.For my lower body: knees bent, feet shoulder-width apart, weight on the balls of my feet. Then I was to push the ball up — not out — release and follow through, fingers pointed down.“On the follow-through, Kobe sometimes joins his thumb and index finger, and his guide hand points at the basket,” Macky would say. “Steph Curry’s guide hand flips out and his arms come together.”The more shots I took — the goal was 100 baskets in a row — the more I could feel myself adapting. Set, shoot, follow-through. Take one step forward and catch the ball as it comes through the net. Repeat. It was surprisingly meditative. Before I knew it, I had made it all the way to 88 shots in a row.But Macky had identified some weaknesses.For one, I was landing with one leg practically a foot in front of the other. Macky had me stick a soccer ball between my legs and practice a series of jump shots while squeezing it between my knees.This was surprisingly hard — either I’d brick the shot, or the soccer ball would pop out — until I focused on taking really small jumps, landing like I was on train tracks. Kavi even sort of complimented me, calling this an “advanced drill” that only the teenagers do.Coach Macky encouraged me to attend his weekly shooting clinic at a high school on the Lower East Side with about two dozen of his other students. They were all between 8 and 14 years old, including my son.I tried to blend in by standing with the coaches. That didn’t last long. When Macky assigned me to work with one of them, Torrence Ested, the first thing Coach Torrence said to me was, “I got you old man.”When I asked Kavi who he thought was more embarrassed by the whole venture — me or him — his vague reply spoke volumes. “Tough to say,” he responded.For the final lessons, Coach Macky moved me out to the 3-point line. I’d never been comfortable shooting the three. Because my old jump shot was a heave that began at the chest, it was all arms and no legs.As it turned out, I’d been learning how to be a better 3-point shooter all along. Proper technique and good arc make for a more accurate shot, regardless of distance.The difference was clear in my final set of drills. I shot above 70 percent from the free throw line, 65 percent on my two pointers, and a remarkably improved 55 percent from 3-point range.But improving my stats was never really the point. I’ve started hooping again at the McBurney YMCA on West 14th Street and reconnecting with the sport I’ve loved since I was a kid practicing in the backyard. My jumper is still a work in progress, but I’m not being left wide open on it anymore.At a recent pickup session — with adults, this time — I was shooting for the last spot in the next game and was matched against the best shooter in our group. We both made our first two free throws, but on the third shot his bounced out. Mine found the bottom of the net.Not quite the Little League championship game, but I’ll take it."
"As Nets guard Joe Harris walks the cobblestone streets outside the team’s practice facility in Sunset Park, no one seems to notice.“Most of the time, I blend in,” he said. “I kind of look like I work in a Brooklyn coffee shop.”Harris’s journey from unemployed castoff to indispensable starter mirrors the rise of the Nets, a team reconstructed through savvy draft picks and second-chance signings. Without a marquee star, the Nets have won 19 of their last 25 games, and they are on a six-game winning streak against opponents in the stronger Western Conference.The Nets had 28 victories last season; now, despite a loss in Boston on Monday, they have the sixth-best record in the Eastern Conference (27-24), and playoff talk is brewing. The injury-riddled team has weathered the loss of Caris LeVert, out with a foot injury since November, and now is without Spencer Dinwiddie, a strong candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year Award, who may be out until mid-March with a thumb injury. In Dinwiddie’s absence, the next-man-up Nets will look to G League call-ups and increased scoring from everyone.“I almost look at Joe as one of the poster boys for the Brooklyn Nets,” the veteran DeMarre Carroll said. “He came in, wasn’t really guaranteed his first year, got on the team, worked his butt off. Each year, he’s gotten better; his numbers, his play, his confidence proves it.”Three years ago, Harris, then with the Cleveland Cavaliers, had the worst day of his basketball life. In a period of a few hours, he had foot surgery, was traded to Orlando and was immediately waived. He was out of the league for six months before the Nets signed him to a minimum contract for less than $1 million in 2016. Last summer, he signed a two-year, $16 million deal to remain with the Nets.“His story is about opportunity and development on a team starting to improve,” Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “Given where he came from, it’s a romantic story, a beautiful story. Everything about him — his humility, the fact that he rides the subway everywhere — is why everybody loves Joe.”Harris’s romance with the game began in Chelan, Wash., where his father coached high school basketball. In fourth grade, Harris came home one afternoon and asked his mother if he could write his basketball goals on his bedroom walls. She assumed he would scribble them on paper and tape them up. Instead, he took a marker and wrote directly on the walls and ceiling. The writings remain in his childhood bedroom, frozen in the amber of a 9-year-old’s penmanship.Given that Chelan is a small town with only two gyms, the worst time of the year was when the courts were being refinished, leaving Harris nowhere to play. One time after an interminable wait, a 10-year-old Harris ran onto the court, slid on his stomach and kissed the floor. “Baby, I’m back!” he screamed.“That pretty much sums me up as a kid,” Harris said. “I just love basketball.”To the right of his childhood bed is his favorite quotation from John Wooden, which he easily recites from memory: “Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing that you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.”There are also lines from Charles Barkley, Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and others, as well as a list of goals. The last goal on the list: “Become a pro.”After playing four years at Virginia, Harris was drafted in the second round by Cleveland in 2014. He played sparingly for two seasons on the LeBron James-led Cavaliers. A few months after he was released, he watched Cleveland win its first N.B.A. title.This season, Harris was averaging 13.4 points a game through Sunday and had the third-best 3-point shooting percentage in the N.B.A. (46.8 percent). Among players with at least 300 field-goal attempts this season, he was eighth at 61.4 in effective field-goal percentage, trailing only Golden State’s Stephen Curry (62.1) among guards and wing players, according to Basketball-Reference.com.“We want him to shoot more bad shots because he’s such a great shooter, but he won’t because he’s such a good guy,” Atkinson said.The pace-and-space era of the N.B.A. has made a player like Harris, a sharpshooter who creates space on the floor and strikes when opportunity arises, more valuable.“The game has slowed down for him,” Atkinson said. “His first two years he was making turnovers, not reading situations right. He used to be a defensive liability, and now we put him sometimes on the best shooter.“I’m pleased that he’s played beyond his contract. For a guy who wasn’t even in the league, he became a stalwart, a guy you can count on.”Casual sports fans may struggle to name a player on the Nets, particularly one who is a regular … well, Joe. The team shot an amusing video spoofing Harris’s accuracy in hopes of earning him a spot in the All-Star 3-point shooting contest.Harris visited spots around Brooklyn — he tossed oranges into a shopping cart, lofted eggs into a hot frying pan and shot some coins into a tip jar.“Joey Buckets! He deserves to be in the contest,” Carroll said when asked about his teammate. Throughout games, Harris is serenaded — “Jo-ey Buck-ets” — by the superfans in the Brooklyn Brigade section of Barclays Center. It’s one of many nicknames. Others include Lumber Joe and Beef Jerky Joe.Beef Jerky Joe? “Like the Sasquatch from the commercial,” Harris said with a laugh.Though Harris has blended into Brooklyn, in truth he is an accidental hipster. On a walk to the Food Hall at the Industry City development in Sunset Park, he was wearing black because it just happens to be the Nets’ team color. His slightly slouchy knit cap was pulled low to fight the chilly gusts from the Brooklyn waterfront. The lumberjack beard was a remnant of a no-shave off-season.Every Nets player except Jared Dudley lives in Brooklyn, a throwback to when the Dodgers were Brooklyn’s team and the players raised their children in the borough and car-pooled to Ebbets Field.Harris walks to Barclays Center on game days. After practices, Atkinson frequently sees him with his backpack, headed to the subway.“He signed a big contract; you’d think he’d get a car service,” Atkinson said. “But that’s him, and that’s us. We’ve had a little success, but we’re still humble.”In the Food Hall, there’s everything a local might expect, like Korean comfort food and an all-avocado restaurant. Harris stopped for a cup of … well, you know. Not a nitro, cold brew or pour over, mind you.“How do you like it?” the barista asked Harris.“Black,” he said."
"LeBron James, sidelined since Dec. 25 with a groin strain, will remain out until at least next week, the Los Angeles Lakers announced Wednesday. The team said in a statement that James did not travel with the Lakers on their current road trip for games against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday and the Houston Rockets on Saturday.The Lakers have struggled without James — and without Rajon Rondo, their backup point guard, who was also injured in the Lakers’ road win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. Entering Thursday, the Lakers had gone 4-7 without those two players and were tied with the Sacramento Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference standings.[On Pro Basketball: The Warriors Prepare to Add Another Star: DeMarcus Cousins]After their current trip, the Lakers will return home to play the Warriors on Monday — which, incidentally, is slated to be Game 2 of the Warriors’ well-publicized DeMarcus Cousins experiment as he returns from surgery on his Achilles’ tendon — but it is highly unlikely that James will be available. The Lakers said in their statement that James “has been cleared to return to practice commencing next week, and progress toward a return to game play thereafter.”James, 34, had been fairly indestructible thus far in his career. He appeared in all 82 regular-season games for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season. But while the Lakers initially listed James as “day to day” after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam last month, the team has been handling him — and his eventual return — with caution.James was playing some of the best basketball of his career before he got hurt, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game. A four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, he is in the first year of a four-year contract worth $154 million."
"Paul George has a small freshwater pond behind his house in Oklahoma City that he stocks with bass, crappie and bluegill. Whenever he has a couple of hours to spare from his responsibilities as a do-everything forward for the N.B.A.’s Thunder, he heads out back with his fishing rod. He releases what he catches — for now, anyway.“Waiting for them to get a little bigger,” he said.George has time. Last summer, on the first night of free agency, he agreed to re-sign with the Thunder on a four-year, $137 million deal. The news emanated from a house party that Russell Westbrook, his superstar teammate, was hosting for George, who did not even entertain meetings with rival teams. He was sticking with the Thunder.In doing so, George made clear that he was banking on his partnership with Westbrook while offering endorsements of the organization and of Oklahoma City’s leisurely pace. He can fish. He can raise his two young children in a quiet neighborhood. And he can focus on basketball, knowing that his future is with the Thunder.“You can give your everything to one organization, and you know the direction that you’re going,” George said in a recent interview. “There’s so much that players have to deal with that I don’t think people quite recognize. A lot of them are the same issues that everybody else deals with. But this takes a lot of the burden off my shoulders.”There is something to be said for (relatively) stress-free living. As several other stars careen toward free agency this summer — and grapple with the accompanying distractions with varying degrees of success — George, 28, has been playing the best basketball of his life.He is averaging 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists, all career highs, while shooting 44 percent from the field and 39.1 percent from 3-point range. He is at least in the conversation for his first N.B.A. Most Valuable Player Award.“I think the shift I’ve seen,” Coach Billy Donovan said, “is a guy who’s a lot more comfortable.”George has been limited recently by shoulder soreness, and Oklahoma City has slipped a bit in the standings. But the Thunder are capable of being a force in the playoffs, and they appear to be a close-knit group. One reason: Oklahoma City is not exactly flush with “extracurriculars,” as George put it, so the players tend to linger at the practice facility. They spend a lot of time together, which has helped build chemistry.“And if one person has to go do something, there’s always someone else who’s like, ‘I’ll tag along with you,’” George said. “That’s kind of been the culture here.”George was traded to the Thunder before the start of last season, after he told the Indiana Pacers that he would not sign a contract extension. Most figured that Oklahoma City would be a pit stop for George, who grew up in Palmdale, Calif., about 50 miles north of Los Angeles. More to the point: He had told the Pacers that he wanted to be shipped to the Lakers.Indiana balked and instead dealt him to Oklahoma City, where George averaged 21.9 points and 5.7 rebounds last season. After Oklahoma City lost in the first round of the playoffs, George was a free agent. He could have gone nearly anywhere, including to the Lakers.“I had so many phone calls and people asking me what he would do when it was all still up in the air,” Tom Hegre, his former coach at Knight High School, said in a telephone interview. “But I personally felt that he would stay with the Thunder. I just didn’t think he would bail on something before he gave it a legitimate chance.”Hegre also said he suspected that Oklahoma City itself had something to do with George’s decision. Even now, after six All-Star appearances, George is a small-town guy and a self-described “homebody.”Back in his high school days, George and his father would occasionally ask Hegre if the team was planning to practice over the weekend. Hegre knew that meant they were thinking about going fishing. They had their favorite spots: Hughes Lake, Lake Elsinore, Lopez Lake, Little Rock Reservoir.“I always thought that was pretty cool,” Hegre said.George has never played in a major market. Not in high school (Palmdale). Not in college (Fresno State). And not in the N.B.A., which may not be a coincidence. When he was with the Pacers, George lived in a suburban community with a large lake, where he kept a boat. He fished there, too.At the same time, his exit from Indiana affected him. It was the first time he felt disliked by the masses, and he was someone who had always tried hard to avoid disappointing or hurting people, said Steve Cleveland, his former coach at Fresno State.When George told Cleveland that he was entering the N.B.A. draft after two seasons at Fresno State, he was apologetic — and so were his parents, who kept apologizing even after George began to star for the Pacers.“I had to say, ‘Stop it,’” Cleveland said. “But that’s the type of people they are.”He added: “I’ve never really asked him this, but I’m sure leaving Indiana was a pretty sensitive deal for him. And I don’t think he wanted to go through all that stress again.”It is not hard to find big-time players who have come unglued at times because of their impending free agencies. Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors boycotted the news media for a couple of weeks. Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics has complained about the steep price of celebrity. For his part, George blamed “the press” for being a disruptive force in locker rooms.“Everything gets blown up,” he said. “Everything is a big deal.”It is no small feat, then, that George has found a home with the Thunder — and calm waters in Oklahoma City."
"The Knicks won a basketball game Thursday night. That has not happened since Jan. 4.There won’t be a ticker-tape parade, but it was a surprise. This, after all, has been a really bad season for the Knicks.They are 11-47. The win, over the Atlanta Hawks, 106-91, broke an 18-game losing streak, which was a franchise record.The team traded away its most popular player by far, Kristaps Porzingis, and in return got a rookie and a couple of expiring contracts. The deal also meant the cancellation of the coming Latvian Heritage Night at Madison Square Garden, which frankly was shaping up to be one of the highlights of the season.To be fair, a core of loyalists insist that these Knicks are a fun bunch to watch. And there is optimistic talk for next year.The Knicks are bad enough to have a decent shot at the top draft pick, probably Zion Williamson, Duke’s superstar big man. Cap space will allow the team to seek big-name free agents, and there is sunny speculation that the team could land stars like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving or even both.We’ll see about that. But for now, fans are left pondering if the Knicks are historically dreadful or just run-of-the-mill dreadful.Let’s see how the Knicks rate, at least in the current century.That means this year’s Knicks won’t have to compete against the consensus worst team of them all, the legendary 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers of 1972-73.Despite a couple of 50-win seasons, in 2000 and 2013, the Knicks’ winning percentage this century is .416, worst in the N.B.A. Yes, even worse than the Washington Wizards, and Charlotte Hornets, and even the Nets.Here is how the 2018-19 Knicks stack up.This is where it begins and ends. Wins. Losses. But mostly losses. Lots and lots of losses.The Knicks are 11-47, giving them a winning percentage that looks like a typo: .190.But there were worse seasons in the last 20 years. In 2012, the Bobcats (now the Hornets) finished at 7-59 in a lockout season for a .106 percentage.Over a full season, the 76ers in 2016, in full tanking mode, only barely managed to break double digit wins with a 10-72 record.The Knicks are only 11th worst.Even counting just those streaks that are contained in a single season, the Knicks’ 18-gamer comes up short. The 2011 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2014 76ers both managed to stumble to 26 straight losses. After Thursday’s win, the Knicks have lost their chance at that ignominious record.The Knicks have been outscored by 8.7 points in an average game this season.Again, there have been worse teams. The 2012 Charlotte strike team lost by 13.9 points a game. The 2000 Clippers put up minus-11.5 over a full season.The Knicks are only 25th.There are those Sixers again: In 2015, they shot .408 for the season. At .430, the Knicks are 39th.The 2009 Grizzlies had only 17.4 assists per game, trailed closely by the 2006 Knicks of Larry Brown, Stephon Marbury and notorious nonpasser Eddy Curry.This season’s Knicks aren’t good, but they aren’t really bad, at 19.9, for 91st place.It is not a good time for defensive stats in the N.B.A. Using the metric points allowed per 100 possessions, three teams this season are in the top five of the century: The Cavaliers are allowing 117 points per 100, worst of the era, and indeed for as far back as Basketball-Reference’s stats go. Over the last 20 years, this season‘s Suns are second, and the Knicks, at 113.4, are seventh.Do any of this year’s Knicks individually reach truly humiliating marks? Not really.Frank Ntilikina’s .342 shooting percentage is poor certainly, but it is only 24th worst among players with 15 minutes a game and 40 games played, a lot better than DeShawn Stevenson’s .285 from the 2012 Nets.So we are forced to conclude, that while dispiritingly bad, the Knicks come up short in another way too. They are not even really close to being the worst team of the last 20 years."
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Stephen Curry was about 25 minutes into a news conference here on Saturday afternoon when a magician who goes by the name Jibrizy sidled up to the dais to do a card trick. Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, seemed impressed.“That was nice, big fella,” Curry said. “That was crazy. Y’all see that? Did y’all see that? What’s your name, boss? Jibrizy? Nice to meet you, man. Fire. You’re fire. That’s what’s up.”Lots of weird stuff tends to happen during N.B.A. All-Star weekend, and a cameo by Jibrizy was no exception. But it was also the rare instance when the spotlight left Curry, if only for a moment, in the run-up to the weekend’s flagship game on Sunday.Curry, a six-time All-Star and two-time most valuable player who has already coaxed Golden State to three championships, is used to lots of attention. But he relished his return to Charlotte, where he grew up to become perhaps the greatest shooter of all time — and where he is still revered.“From the time I started playing basketball at 5, right down the street at the recreation center, to now, a lot has happened,” Curry said. “A lot of great things.”Curry was not so great Sunday, but that was not the point. He finished with 17 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists for Team Giannis in a 178-164 loss to Team LeBron in the All-Star Game, which was a defense-free postscript to a weekend that was a Curry family affair.“Incredibly fond of the family,” Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters. “They seem to be the first family of Charlotte, at least this week.”For much of his trip home, Curry was accompanied by his father, Dell, who spent 10 seasons playing for the Charlotte Hornets, and his mother, Sonya, who drilled a half-court heave after the family helped refurbish a community center. It was probably the family’s splashiest shot of the weekend.“I was surprised,” Stephen Curry said, “because the first four she flung underhand, they didn’t make it to the rim. And then that last one, it just looked good from the moment it left her hand, and I was going, ‘Wham, bam, can of ham! That’s going in!’ ”Curry had less success in Saturday night’s 3-point shootout, where he was joined by his younger brother, Seth, who plays for the Portland Trail Blazers. Stephen Curry made it to the championship round before losing to Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets.But Curry had also found time to return to Davidson College, his alma mater, where he clambered into the student section to celebrate an 80-72 victory over St. Joseph’s on Friday night.“The energy in the building was unbelievable,” Curry said. “It’s surreal every time I get to go back there.”The following afternoon, Curry swayed in a sea of reporters (and at least one magician) as he fielded a wide-ranging mix of questions.What did it mean to him to be back in Charlotte? “It’s kind of overwhelming to be honest,” he said. “I’ve got to be like the Energizer bunny.”Could he say something nice to all his fans in the Dominican Republic? “I’ve been there, and I hope to go back,” he said.Did he have a favorite basketball-themed movie? “Probably ‘Love & Basketball,’ ” he said. “I’m a romantic, bro.”During warm-ups for Sunday’s game, Curry mimicked a game of volleyball with Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, posted up a ball boy so that he could take an entry pass from Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook, made chitchat with bigwigs who were courtside and jacked his share of 30-footers. Most of them went in. All-Star weekend is a circus, but it is still basketball, after all, and Curry has unique skills.He is assembling another spectacular season, even if his work has been overshadowed by fellow All-Stars like James Harden of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Thunder and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been so consistently good for so long now — and his team so dominant — that perhaps some of the novelty has worn off. It is unfair, of course.If his feats feel too familiar, consider his production this season: 28.6 points, 5.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 48.8 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from 3-point range. He missed 11 games with a groin injury but spent part of that time gluing the Warriors’ locker room back together after Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had a big dust-up.The friction stemmed from Durant’s looming free agency, which has been a steady hum of distraction for the Warriors. But Curry has been a stabilizing force for his team — and even for the league.With a contract that runs through the 2021-22 season, Curry has not had to face pressing questions about his future. He is committed to the Warriors, and the Warriors appear committed to him. He is a throwback in an era dominated by player movement, the current face of which is Anthony Davis, the All-Star center who recently requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans. So many other stars face uncertain summers, too: Durant, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard among them.But Curry has his niche in Northern California, even if his roots are in North Carolina. After Sunday’s game, he described trying to persuade his father to move to the Bay Area, where Curry has settled in with his wife, Ayesha, and their three children.Dell Curry, who is a color commentator for the Hornets, always says no.“This is where home is for him,” Stephen Curry said.And for Stephen Curry, the whereabouts of his father seem to be the only player movements on his mind. Curry said he was unconcerned with free agency this summer and the potential departures of his teammates.“That’s a part of the business,” Curry said. “But the great teams, the great players, they stay in the moment and they understand what’s in front of them.”And so, after taking a weekend to dip into his past, Curry returned to looking ahead. The journey goes on."
"Steven Soderbergh’s electrifying new film “High Flying Bird,” which debuted Friday on Netflix, tells the story of a fictional N.B.A. lockout set in the Instagram Age, in which longstanding concerns about money, race and social justice are galvanized by disputes over players’ personal images, and who has the right to control them. (Appropriately, the entire film was shot on an iPhone.)The film’s dense but fast-moving script, written by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), is also replete with references to the game’s history — not least to the currents of protest and politics that have coursed through pro basketball since it was segregated. There’s a rich subtext here, much of it only hinted at. Below is a spoiler-filled guide.As in baseball, football and most areas of American life, segregation kept black players out of the white pro basketball leagues, confined to amateur and semipro all-black teams, which formed in schools, churches, community centers and the like. Games were frequently paired with ragtime dances to make for a full evening of entertainment.The best known of these barnstorming teams, often called “Black Fives” by historians, were the New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Renaissance — or, as they were better known, the Rens — were so impressive that in 1947, Coach Joe Lapchick of the New York Knicks lobbied the Basketball Association of America to admit the team into the young league, a precursor of the National Basketball Association. The owners voted him down. The next year, a competing league, the National Basketball League, brought the team in instead.[Read the Times review of “High Flying Bird” by A.O. Scott.]Indirectly. The Rens and the Globetrotters, in particular, were internationally known for their dazzling play, often besting white teams when matched up for exhibition games. The Rens, for example, beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the first integrated tournament championship in 1939; the Globetrotters beat the Minnesota Lakers in a celebrated 1948 exhibition game that The Chicago Tribune pinpointed as key to the integration of the game.As Spencer (Bill Duke) explains in “High Flying Bird”: “There’s a reason why the N.B.A. started integrating as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions started going international. Control. They wanted the control of a game that we played, and we played better.”Lapchick, however, did not give up. In 1950, the year after the Basketball Association of America absorbed the smaller National Basketball League and became the N.B.A., he signed Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton, who had played for the Rens and the Globetrotters (as well as in baseball’s Negro leagues), to join the Knicks. That same season, West Virginia State’s Earl Lloyd joined the Washington Capitals and Chuck Cooper was drafted out of Duquesne by the Boston Celtics. (Another black player, Hank DeZonie, played five games with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in December of that season.)Talking to The Times in 2008, Lloyd told stories of being heckled and spat upon by fans, although the abuse he encountered was “no comparison,” he said, to what Jackie Robinson withstood three years earlier in professional baseball.Yes — in fact, there were four. (One lasted only a few hours.) In the first dialogue scene of “High Flying Bird,” the sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland) tells a client, “Last time this happened, folks was broke left and right!” That “last time” was the 2011 lockout, which lasted  five months and resulted in the loss of 16 regular-season games, the entire preseason and an estimated $400 million in revenue for team owners and players.A 10-year deal was announced late that November, which heavily favored owners. It reduced player salaries by nearly $300 million and shifted an estimated $3 billion to the owners over the course of the contract. The truncated 66-game season finally got underway on Christmas Day.Much screen time in “High Flying Bird” is spent contemplating the legality of public appearances and exhibition games by league-signed players during the lockout. The 2011 lockout was threaded with similar concerns. The film’s fictional team owners grouse over the attention attracted by a “lockout street ball event in Las Vegas,” presumably inspired by the “lockout league” in Vegas, which comprised two weeks of pickup games with more than 70 N.B.A. players in September 2011, according to The Las Vegas Sun. (Profits from ticket sales were donated to charity).Dozens of players filled the pay gap by picking up spots on teams in Europe and Japan. As The Times’s Howard Beck noted at the time, however, “a vast majority of them are rookies, middling veterans and fringe players.”As New York magazine and others have noted, the character Myra (Sonja Sohn) strongly resembles Michele Roberts, who became the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association in 2014. The first woman in history to head a major sports union, Roberts made waves from the beginning. A Times profile a few months into her tenure noted that she had already “forcefully questioned the league’s pay model and labeled its entire cadre of owners as replaceable.”Like the character she inspired, Roberts is a tough-as-nails negotiator who is undaunted by working in a male-dominated world. “My past,” she told players while making her case for the job, “is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.”In the film’s first scene, Ray gives a client a mysterious package, calling it “the Bible.” It contains the book “The Revolt of the Black Athlete” by the sports sociologist and civil rights advocate Dr. Harry Edwards, who also appears briefly in Ray’s office near the end of the film. Edwards first came to national prominence for organizing the Olympic Project for Human Rights, whose members Tommie Smith and John Carlos made headlines for raising their gloved fists while receiving medals at the 1968 Olympics.Edwards has spent the ensuing years teaching, writing, consulting and leading protests. “Revolt,” published in 1969, argued that racism is as prevalent in sports as in any other section of society. “The sports world is not a rose flourishing in the middle of a wasteland,” he writes. “It is part and parcel of that wasteland, reeking of the same racism that corrupts other areas of our society.”“High Flying Bird” is bookended by recordings of two folk-rock classics, both performed by Richie Havens as part of his opening set at Woodstock. The title track, Havens’s recording of a folk song written by Billy Edd Wheeler, was praised by the musicologist Richie Unterberger for its “arresting minor-keyed melody and brooding lyrics, contrasting the freedom of a bird to the singer’s earthbound misery.” It isn’t hard to connect those lyrics to Ray’s notion that his clients should free themselves from the earthbound constraints of the sports industry and bring the game back to its roots.“Handsome Johnny,” which Havens wrote with the Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr., closes the film, telling the story of a young man who marches off to a series of wars. Given the movie’s themes, the song’s refrain is appropriate: “It’s a long hard road, hey, before we’ll be free.”"
"Jarrett Allen stood outside a Key Food Supermarket in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn and handed 25 local children a grocery list and a calculator. Their task was to use math, and a calculator imprinted with Allen’s name and Nets jersey number, to fill their grocery carts and stay within the $100 budget he gave them.Plenty of N.B.A. stars have their own shoe, clothing, underwear and eyewear lines — often vanity projects for oversize fashionistas. Allen is different. And not just because his name is stretched across a calculator instead of kicks.“Math is the future,” he said.“He’s so different from everyone usually in the N.B.A.,” said Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie, his closest friend on the team. “Everybody else is like, ‘Wow, he’s weird.’ When everyone was referencing him as weird, or just kind of different, I was like, ‘Man, that’s my guy.’ He’s extremely smart. I love having conversations with him on that level.”In the N.B.A., one man’s weird just might be another man’s love of STEM. “It started with destroying stuff,” Allen said. “I would break things apart, then put them together. Then my dad gave us one of his super-old computers, and I’ve really been on that track since I was probably around 5.”In high school, he built his own computer, which he still uses today. Like most 20-year-olds in the N.B.A., he loves gaming, particularly Overwatch, but he doesn’t play the ubiquitous NBA 2K. “I don’t play sports video games,” he said. “My whole life revolves around sports.”After finishing his freshman year at Texas and declaring for the draft, N.B.A. teams had questions about his commitment. Did he love the game enough? Or did he play just because he’s tall? (He’s listed at 6-foot-11, but he’s more like 7-foot-3 with hair included.) Some N.B.A. talent evaluators would prefer their prospects have a singular interest, a life spinning on the axis of an orange ball.Though Allen professed his love for the game during predraft interviews, he made it clear he was more than just a basketball player. The Nets saw the big picture, selected him 22nd over all in 2017, and hoped he, at center, would become the cornerstone of their rebuilding project.Allen opened this season with back-to-back double-doubles, and added another, plus several near-misses, before sitting out two games because of an illness. In his first three games back, he averaged 17.7 points, 12.3 rebounds and nearly two blocks a game.“He has everything you want. He’s athletic, he can run the floor, space the floor vertically, shoot, finish with both hands and protect the rim,” Dinwiddie said. “Right now, the only thing you can knock him for is not being physically imposing, but he’s only 20 years old, and all of that is going to come with time. If that’s all you’re missing in your game, you’re doing really well.”Allen’s father, Leonard, was a standout center for San Diego State from 1981 to 1985 and held a school blocked-shot record that was broken in 2015. The Dallas Mavericks picked Leonard Allen 50th over all in the 1985 draft, but he didn’t catch on with a team. After playing in Europe, he returned home to Texas and transitioned into a career at Dell computers.“Basketball wasn’t the main focus,” Jarrett Allen said of his childhood. “For my dad, he played his whole life. His life revolved around it. He just wanted us to be normal kids.”Growing up in Round Rock, Tex., Allen was blissfully unaware of the intensity of elite youth basketball. “I didn’t know about that whole crazy A.A.U. scene,” he said.Allen and his older brother Leonard played basketball in church and community rec center leagues for fun. “We were clueless about organized basketball, at least on an elite level,” said his mother, Cheryl. “We didn’t even know it existed, and I’m glad we were oblivious to that world.”Free from the demands of travel team sports, Allen pursued other interests. “Jarrett from an early age has always had an interest and curiosity about the world around him,” Cheryl Allen said. “That is why his transition to Brooklyn has been an easy one. I’d like to think that not starting elite basketball so young helped. He was able to be a kid as long as possible before becoming consumed by it, which unfortunately happens.”At the end of Allen’s sophomore year in high school, it became clear that college basketball might be an option. “I didn’t know the college scene was that big. I didn’t know the N.B.A. was that big,” he said.On some nights after games at Barclays Center, Allen walks home, which usually takes 25 minutes. “It’s nice to just enjoy the night,” he said.Nicknamed the Fro, his hairstyle isn’t some tribute to Dr. J and the A.B.A. of decades past. “I’m not trying to show it off, show that I can make it round,” Allen said. “I’m not even wearing it because it’s old school. It’s just how it is. I’m just wearing it because it’s my hair. I’ve had it for five years. I’m in too deep now.”His hair was one of many topics that came up when he did an “Ask Me Anything” online chat on Reddit (he considers himself a Redditor) just before the season started. He was asked questions such as: “What is the coolest celebrity experience you’ve had since getting to the NBA/New York?”Answer: “I got a free slice of cake for dessert at a restaurant one time.”And: “How do you achieve that amazing Afro? How much time do you spend on it a day?” Answer: “45 seconds every morning.” Shampoo? “Herbal Essence.”Allen continues to field questions from the intrigued, though most recently the askers were the children he had given calculators for a pre-Thanksgiving shopping trip and math lesson.During the nearly two hours in the grocery store for his event, Allen shopped for his own groceries, helped the children with their calculations, grabbed the occasional box of penne off the top shelf for customers and answered no-filter questions.“Can you cross Allen Iverson?” an 8-year-old boy asked.“Given he’s about 50 years old, yes,” Allen said.“Can you dunk on LeBron?”“I’ve never tried,” he said.After locating some hard-to-find items — “Where’s the crescent rolls?” — Allen checked out $40 under budget.The feat seems to be more reflective of a lifestyle than one good day at the grocery store.“He doesn’t have a car,” Nets forward Jared Dudley said. “He doesn’t care about materialistic things. He cares about playing basketball, family and doing what he loves to do.”However varied that may be.So far, Allen has splurged on just one big purchase. “A part for my computer,” he said."
"LeBron James can’t say that he wasn’t warned. Lots of us were crowing in the summer, and pretty loudly so, about what would greet the unquestioned Lord of the Eastern Conference if he dared to defect. Sign with the Los Angeles Lakers if you wish, for the sunnier Hollywood life and all the perks, but brace yourself for the most trying regular season of your career if you decide to go West. That was the gist of the scouting report — which in retrospect could not have been much more prescient. On cue: The most daunting and, yes, disappointing season of James’s career is right here, right now, for the biggest name in basketball.And it appears he will soon have to stomach that it’s going on his ledger in the most permanent ink that he was unable to bring a halt to the longest postseason drought in Lakers history — barring an unforeseen resurrection from a fractured group that sits four and a half games out of a Western Conference playoff berth with 19 games to go.No matter how much culpability you wish to assign James for what is poised to go down as the Lakers’ franchise-record sixth successive trip to the draft lottery, he’s going to have to own this as much as the front-office tandem of Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka as well as the under-fire coach Luke Walton.The LeBron Way, for years and years, has worked something like this: He inevitably gets most of the credit when his team flourishes; his teammates absorb the bulk of the blame when things unravel. But this is different. This would be the jarring sight of James, fresh off his eighth consecutive finals appearance, actually missing out on the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since his second professional season in 2004-5, when he was just 20.Even though he can rightly point to his recent groin strain as the biggest standings-altering disruption these Lakers have endured, James surely understands that his maiden campaign in Los Angeles is bound to be recorded in many precincts as a failure to make the playoffs that belongs to him.The Lakers are 4-7 since James returned from the groin injury that sidelined him longer (17 consecutive games) than any previous injury in his 16-year career. They have followed up an unsightly road loss to Atlanta in their final game before the All-Star break with harder-to-rationalize road losses to New Orleans, Memphis and Phoenix since the break.After Saturday night’s humiliation against a 13-51 Suns team, which dropped the Lakers to 30-33, James’s gang only sports a 1.3-percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to Basketball-Reference.com.They also have the league’s eighth-toughest remaining schedule, according to Tankathon.com. We’ll never know if the Lakers, who had risen to a heady fourth in the West at 20-14 when James sustained the groin injury in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State, could have kept building upon that promising start with a healthy LeBron. But we most certainly do know that James’s mere return to the lineup, at 34, wasn’t enough to rescue a roster that has been assailed since conception for its lack of perimeter shooting and its defensive deficiencies. Nor has he been able to galvanize a locker room that was deeply destabilized by the Lakers’ trade pursuit of the New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, which became all-consuming in late January, and has never recovered. It obviously doesn’t help that James, after missing two key free throws in the final minute Saturday, is also converting a substandard 66.9 percent of his attempts from the line to give his critics more handy fodder.Leaving his home-state Cleveland Cavaliers for the Lakers last July without the accompaniment of a second superstar meant that James, in a far deeper conference, would have little margin for error just to reach the playoffs. When you combine James’s injury absence with the continuing post-Davis malaise and the team’s declining ball movement since Lonzo Ball (ankle) was sidelined six weeks ago, it adds up rather quickly to a margin that is long gone.The calls for Walton’s dismissal, as they were in January, remain nonsensical. A coaching change now, much like New Orleans’s decision to fire General Manager Dell Demps shortly after the trade deadline, would have no discernible effect on the Lakers’ short-term prospects beyond providing their frustrated fans with a “See? We did something” sacrifice.The prevailing assumption in league coaching circles remains that Walton will almost certainly be dismissed after the season, followed by the Lakers resuming their trade quest for Davis. But denying Walton an opportunity to at finish out a season wrought with drama and distraction since James’s first dribble in purple and gold would be cruel and needless. Changes are coming, though. It’s an open secret that a big off-season reset looms in Lakerland. James always knew that his new club would not be in the title mix until his second campaign as a Laker, but his patience predictably faded quickly — one more reason desperation has become so palpable around this team. Many of us know-it-alls in the news media indeed wrote in our preseason forecasts that the playoffs were no certainty for these Lakers, as constructed, but very few of us were actually willing to outright predict that they would miss out. Reason being: It’s not very smart to bet against LeBron Raymone James.Yet we’ve suddenly reached that unprecedented juncture where it would be wholly irresponsible to advise you that James can extricate himself from this jam just because he’s LeBron. Whether it’s the lingering effects from his groin injury, or his own unmistakably waning spirit in the face of increasingly bleak odds, James has been lacking the zip you associate with his well-chronicled playoff mode — which he assured us on Feb. 21 had been “activated” earlier than usual.I briefly stood beside James on the floor in Charlotte, N.C., before the All-Star Game tipped off and bought into the idea a surge was coming when he insisted he was eager to embrace “the challenge” of hauling the Lakers out of their hole.“And I’m getting healthy, too,” James said that night. A mere two weeks later, it’s already time to start imagining the N.B.A.’s first spring without King James after watching him for eight straight Junes — and wondering how on Earth he’s going to cope with not being a part of it."
"The Knicks will not be going to the N.B.A. playoffs.If this doesn’t feel like hot-off-the-presses news, it shouldn’t. You may have checked the standings earlier in the season and seen that the Knicks were 4-10, or 8-20, or 10-40.With Monday night’s 115-108 loss to the Kings in Sacramento, the Knicks fell to a record of 13-51, the worst in the league. Yes, even worse than the Bulls, the Cavaliers and (shudder) the Suns. The loss also officially eliminated them from a playoff race they were unofficially eliminated from months ago.The loss, to a team that will probably also miss the playoffs, was hardly mitigated by a good scoring effort by the rookie shooting guard Allonzo Trier, who had 29 points.The Knicks are last in the league in shooting percentage and last in assists. So, in short, they can’t pass and they can’t shoot. Basketball Reference reports that they are particularly bad at the easiest type of shot, shooting only .603 from three feet or closer and .348 from three to 10 feet, both worst in the league.The rookie center Mitchell Robinson is fifth in the league in blocks and third in blocks per game. That’s good. But no other Knick is in the top five in anything. That’s not good.When you don’t have a lot of wins, you wind up with some losing streaks. It’s just math. The Knicks came into the new year with an eight-game, a six-game and a couple of five-game skids, as one might expect. More unexpected: In January and February, the Knicks lost 18 in a row.On the plus side, the Knicks have put together two winning streaks. One was two games and the other was three.The Knicks have now missed the playoffs for six straight years, just short of the franchise record. From 1960 to 1966, the Knicks missed the playoffs seven straight times. But those Knicks teams always won at least 21 games in that span. This season, the Knicks are on a pace to win 16 or 17 games, giving them a chance to break the franchise-worst record of 17 in the abysmal 2014-15 season.Knicks fans, desperate for a light at the end of the 82-game tunnel, are already focusing on the coming draft lottery, right Spike Lee? Zion Williamson, Duke’s dominant center, is the big prize. Adding Williamson and a couple of free agents lured by the bright lights of New York may finally bring the postseason back to Madison Square Garden.Unfortunately for the Knicks, the rules have been changed some this year, and having the very worst record does not offer any advantage. The three worst teams, one of whom is virtually certain to be the Knicks, all will have an identical 14 percent chance of landing the top pick. If the Knicks really are tanking to get a lower lottery spot, they can probably stop now."
"GREENSBORO, N.C. — As advanced statistical analysis and its attendant new technology continue to reshape how sports are understood, watched and even played — when to punt on fourth down in football, where to position a baseball team’s infielders and how to build a winning basketball team — these new numbers also create a vexing problem:How to account for what complex algorithms cannot explain.The thirst for information is such that one essential set of college basketball data that will help determine the field for this month’s N.C.A.A. tournament, Ken Pomeroy’s eponymous KenPom ratings, includes a metric to shed light on when things do not actually go by the numbers.Pomeroy has a rather analog term for it: luck.“Luck is basically performance in close games,” Pomeroy said. “People generally don’t like the term ‘luck’ — that’s the feedback I get. Technically, I’d call it ‘randomness’ or something a lot more wordy, but that doesn’t fit well above a column.”In short, KenPom’s luck factor considers the difference between a team’s record and what the data would expect it to be. If a team’s record is better than its predictive numbers, it is lucky. If it is worse, then it is unlucky.This season, according to the KenPom ratings, no team among the 353 Division I college men’s basketball programs has been luckier than the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.The Spartans resemble a team one might expect from a coach, Wes Miller, who transferred to North Carolina as a walk-on, then earned a letter on a national championship team and eventually a spot in the starting lineup. They are resourceful and determined, and have the ethos (and the recruiting budget) of an underdog.Greensboro has a 28-6 record — the best in program history — and finished second in the Southern Conference, behind Wofford, which was ranked 20th in this week’s Associated Press poll.Did luck have something to do with it?Miller, pulling up a folding chair before a recent practice, reacted as one might expect. He praised Pomeroy as “a genius,” expressed fascination with analytics and said there were others on his staff who delve deeper into the data to provide the most salient information about the Spartans and their opponents.Then he assumed a defensive stance.“I’m not a mathematician,” he said. “I’m a basketball coach who’s always trying to figure out an edge to help me coach better. But there’s never been anybody that could put a number on will and togetherness of group.“There’s something that’s happening in our games that’s indescribable to his data that’s getting us over the hump,” Miller added. “That’s toughness. That’s the ability to win close games. The proudest I ever am as a coach is when we have an awful shooting game or we have an awful offensive game and things don’t go our way and we still find a way because our team was able to dig down and figure out a way to get over the hump.”Francis Alonso, a senior guard from Malaga, Spain, who is the heartbeat of his team, put it another way: “There’s this saying — it’s champions’ luck.”Alan Castel, a psychology professor at U.C.L.A. who studies memory and metacognition — how we think about our thinking — said that while confidence (or the lack of it) is a fundamental element of athletic competition, it is often misplaced.“The human mind doesn’t rely on big data,” said Castel, whose research has debunked the hot-hand theory — the belief that a team should get the ball to a shooter who is on a hot streak. “We’re prone to rely on illusions and small sample sizes and what we want to think.”If Greensboro’s Spartans are the luckiest team in the country, he said, they deserve some of the credit for it.“To be lucky, you need to put yourself in a situation,” Castel said. “To win the lottery, you need to buy a ticket.”Or, he added, to win the N.C.A.A. tournament, you need to get in. And to do that, the Spartans almost certainly will require a little more luck.Some years ago, a résumé like the Spartans’ might have looked glossier. They have a sparkling record, are 7-0 in games decided by 5 points or fewer and have been competitive in defeats at 10th-ranked Louisiana State (97-91) and sixth-ranked Kentucky (78-61), a game that they led with less than nine minutes left. But they lost to Wofford twice in the regular season — by 29 and 30 points — and for a third time on Monday night, 70-58, in the Southern Conference tournament championship game.Yet it is this profile — a team that has squeaked past bad teams, competed against good ones and been pounded only twice, by the best team in its conference — that explains why Greensboro’s luck factor is +.175, which, if it holds until the season is over, would be the highest of any team since 2013.What that figure means, Pomeroy said, is that in a luck-free environment, the Spartans’ winning percentage would be 0.175 lower than it is. As a result, they would have six fewer victories — and a 22-12 record — without any luck.There are real-world consequences: Through Tuesday’s games, Greensboro ranked 81st in KenPom’s overall ratings, lagging behind East Tennessee State (71st) and Furman (55th), against whom they combined to win four of five games this season. (The N.C.A.A.’s new NET metric, which the tournament selection committee is using to evaluate teams this year, is only slightly kinder: It has the Spartans 58th.)Once the N.C.A.A. tournament begins next week, with a broad spectrum of schools from around the country, a clearer picture will emerge of whether teams that have been deemed to have enjoyed metric good fortune have punched above their weight all season.The Spartans, at this point, would consider themselves lucky to have the chance."
"Zion Williamson’s legend grows with every game these days, with each new thundering dunk and every stunning new feat of elevation. It has been this way for several years now, with Williamson the featured actor in a growing collection of viral clips that show a player with the skills to outrun almost anyone, to catch almost anything, to challenge almost anybody. Even his lowest moments — the sneaker that couldn’t hold him, the injured knee that cost him five games — have somehow morphed into highlights. But Williamson, an 18-year-old Duke freshman, has been making memorable moments for years. A group of New York Times reporters tracked down some of the people who were present for a few of them, to ask them about the memories that stand out the most.Forgive Tom Konchalski.The publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated first observed Zion Williamson in person at the Elite 24, an all-star showcase for the nation’s top prep prospects, on Aug. 20, 2016. The court at Pier 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park was the stage, and Williamson was 10 for 10 from the field, scored 23 points and shared most valuable player honors. Konchalski was impressed.To Konchalski’s well-trained eye — in five decades he had amassed an inventory of reports that stretched from Michael Jordan to LeBron James — Williamson, who had just turned 16, appeared to be an interior technician, a player at ease turning on his defender to make it to the rim for understated finishes. Because of Williamson’s body type, Konchalski considered him a left-handed Jamal Mashburn, a reference to the beefy Bronx product who played 11 seasons in the N.B.A.When Konchalski sat down at his typewriter after the Elite 24 to describe Williamson’s effort, he wrote that the “6-foot-5 junior Zion Williamson, the master of quiet domination, provided a bit of fresh air.”Looking back, Konchalski says now, he got it all wrong.“I’m wiping off copious amounts of egg from my face,” he said. Williamson, he knows, “is anything but quiet.” The first time LeBron James showed up to watch Zion Williamson, they wouldn’t let him in the door.It was July 2017, and James, once a transcendent teenage talent himself, went to see Williamson, the next big thing, at a showcase in Las Vegas. Williamson’s team, South Carolina Supreme, was playing Big Baller Brand, which featured LaMelo Ball, a brother of Lakers guard Lonzo Ball. It was, by summer youth basketball standards, a must-see event.James, of course, wasn’t the only one interested in that confluence of basketball stardust. The N.B.A. players Damian Lillard, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Murray and Thon Maker were in the gym by the time James arrived, adding buzz to a crowd of more than 4,000 that threatened to swamp a court configured to hold less than half that many.Even in warm-ups, the excitement was palpable. The fans oohed and aahed as Williamson tossed balls high in the air and dunked them; many spectators held cellphones, the better to share video clips of a scene that was quickly called the “craziest A.A.U. game ever.” But James never saw any of it. With fans standing a dozen deep, nearly spilling onto the court from every direction, he and his group were told that just letting him into the gym constituted a security risk. A teenager’s mere presence, it seemed, had squeezed out basketball’s biggest star. James was told he couldn’t come in.“We shut him down,” an Adidas marketing executive told CBS Sports at the time. “The corners were 500 deep. That’s where it got insane.” It would be a year and a half before James got to see Williamson play in person. In February, he took a 35-minute flight from Philadelphia to Charlottesville, Va., and watched from courtside as Williamson, playing for Duke, went for 18 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a win against Virginia. Williamson’s athleticism, James declared, was “ridiculous.” Bishop Richardson was averaging about three alley-oop assists to Williamson every game when their team, Spartanburg (S.C.) Day School, arrived at Ben Lippen School in Columbia, S.C., for a game during Williamson’s junior year. Williamson dunked a lot back then, and he had recorded at least two slams in the first half that had the gym rocking. “I remember it vividly,” Williamson said last week. “Their student section was really into the game, talking a lot.”The real highlight, though, was still to come. With Spartanburg ahead by 39 points, Richardson, a spindly guard who had played varsity since the eighth grade, found himself jogging easily up the right sideline when he spotted Williamson closing menacingly down the other side of the court. He tried another lob; he knew the pass didn’t have to be perfect.“If you threw it anywhere near the rim,” Richardson said, “he was going to get it.” On this occasion, Richardson’s toss arrived well below the rim. But that enabled Williamson to do something outrageous: He rose into the air, reached out with two hands to grab the incoming pass at about shoulder height, and — still rising, now high enough to peer inside the rim he was about to shake — used one sweeping, circular motion to bring the ball down to his waist and then back up to the left side of his body before ramming it through the basket with his left hand.The crowd erupted. “I remember thinking, ‘Holy cow, I’ve never seen anyone do anything like that, let alone be a part of it,’” Richardson said. “People were falling out of the bleachers.”The dunk made it onto highlight reels and national sports shows within hours, but Richardson did not see a replay until the next day, when he and teammates sneaked a peek in a study hall.“I wish I could take credit for it,” Richardson said, “but it was completely accidental.” Vertical leap is measured using a simple contraption: a tall pole with a series of long, metal fingers that project horizontally from it on top of one another — narrow wings stacked up, up, up, at consistent increments. It may seem lo-fi, but it is also foolproof: Your vertical reach while jumping is the highest metal flange you are able to bat away from its set position. Subtract standing vertical reach from that number, and you have a player’s vertical leap. When Duke put its players through the test one day last summer, Zion Williamson’s vertical leap was measured at 46 inches. But to the teammates and Duke staff members who were present, mere numbers do not do the moment justice.“We were all in shock,” the sophomore guard Alex O’Connell said. Williamson, who went last, was off the charts. On his first attempt, he casually swatted aside the highest measurement. A staff member adjusted the pole to its highest setting and reset the tabs, and Williamson repeated the feat. They put weights under the contraption to lift it a few more inches into the air. Williamson batted the highest measurements aside again. “It was something you don't see a lot, especially with a guy who is built like him flying through the air,” forward Javin DeLaurier said. “It's a sight to behold.”Nolan Smith, an assistant coach who played for four years at Duke and several more in the N.B.A. and Europe, said he had never seen anything like it. Cam Reddish, another Blue Devils’ freshman, said he missed out; he said he was in another part of the building when Williamson tested the test itself. “I just heard that he broke the record,” Reddish said. “Zion things.”In the beginning, the former Duke standout Jay Williams kept track of the Williamson hype the same way everybody else did: through low-quality video clips shot in high school gyms and then posted on the internet. Williamson’s high-flying plays quickly became “the eighth wonder of the world,” Williams said.Then he saw him in person. “I have never seen a player casually do a 360 in a game,” Williams said of seeing Williamson do precisely that in a game against Clemson this season. “Even when you saw Vince do it in college,” he said, referring to Vince Carter, who played at the University of North Carolina, “there was a level of oomph that he needed to exert that type of energy. My man casually did it in the game. He did a 360 like I would do a layup.”Williams said plays like that one were the reason comparing Williamson to other basketball players is a mistake. “To me, I was looking at a football player who had the finesse of basketball ability,” he said. “I’ve never seen that before. I played against Julius Peppers in college. I remember him being the only guy Carlos Boozer was somewhat intimidated to go against because he couldn’t just move him around. I remember thinking for the first time: ‘Oh, I was looking at Julius Peppers but through a basketball lens. What? What?’ Julius was agile, but I am talking about the frame of the body. It reminded me of a linebacker or a tight end. Just different.” Spike Lee was in his seat and Barack Obama was settled in his, down past the end of the Duke bench. But in front of North Carolina’s Luke Maye — in the space where Zion Williamson had stood a moment earlier — there was suddenly … nothing. “I didn’t hear anything, man,” Maye said Thursday. What everyone quickly realized was that the story had quickly changed from a heated rivalry game — top-ranked Duke vs. No. 8 North Carolina — into something far more bizarre: Williamson’s Nike sneaker had broken apart as he made a move at the free-throw line. He was down. North Carolina was racing upcourt. And everyone else was asking: What just happened? Maye, in that moment, had the best seat in the house. “I just took the ball,” he said, “and just started going.”Initially, the Blue Devils were just as confused. The first thing Duke’s Javin DeLaurier saw from his spot on the bench was the sneaker on Williamson’s left foot, or what was left of it, anyway: Its sole was flapping free, like a banner in the wind.To DeLaurier, this counted as good news.“I was like, ‘Oh, no, it’s just his shoe,’” he said. “There was a sigh of relief.”He had, after all, seen this before. He had blown out a shoe before. He had seen Williamson do it, too. “Zion’s a big human being, moving pretty fast, changing direction,” DeLaurier said. “It happens.”“I consider it my fault,” De’Andre Hunter says now.He’s not wrong. Late in a February game at Virginia, Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy whipped the ball crosscourt to his teammate De’Andre Hunter, who waited at the 3-point line, deep in the corner, and without a Duke player within 15 feet of him. Williamson was on the left side of the court, playing his usual feisty, active defense, so Hunter, in the right corner, took his time uncoiling the 3-point attempt.Williamson, though, had closed the gap by then. Soaring across the court with five quick steps, he took off from about six feet away just as Hunter unloaded. “I consider it my fault,” Hunter said. “I took way too long setting it up and releasing the shot. But he came a long way.” In fact, Williamson jumped so high and stretched so vertically that his right hand was well above the height of the 10-foot rim when he cleanly swatted Hunter’s shot into the stands. “He just came out of nowhere,” Hunter said. Worse news, at least for Hunter, was that the clip made its way to ESPN’s “SportsCenter” and other highlight shows, and it is now a staple of the Williamson YouTube filmography. “I didn’t know it was going to be such a big deal,” Hunter said recently."
"GLENS FALLS, N.Y. — Joe Girard III, an 18-year-old senior at Glens Falls High School and a pitiless scoring machine, hurried across the school’s hardwood court, placed his inhaler on a table and started his basketball season with a passing drill.It was a recent afternoon. He looked worn. Two days earlier, he had led his school’s football team to a state title as a quarterback. He threw two touchdown passes, ran for another two scores and earned most valuable player honors.Now, at basketball practice, red dots marked where a football opponent had stepped on his left hand with his cleats. His right hand was swollen from being sandwiched between the helmets of two players.And yet today he and his teammates threw a 41-ounce basketball — almost twice as heavy as a game ball — to one another. He caught the heavy ball last. He squared up on the left wing — just inside the 3-point arc — and shot it. It went in.With that shot, Joe Girard III’s pivot to basketball was complete.“Those used to be air balls,” said Rob Girard, the team’s head coach and a cousin of the marksman. “He’s getting stronger.”Girard, who is 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, and goes by JG3, averaged 50 points a game and set the state’s career scoring mark last winter with 3,306 points. Perched atop the scoring annals, he has an enviable challenge ahead on his home court in the Adirondack foothills — the same court on which another productive scorer, Jimmer Fredette, elicited oohs and aahs not too long ago.“The question now is: What do you do after averaging 50?” his father, Joe Girard Jr., said. “He has a year to go, which is scary.”It all started at the free-throw line. As a fifth grader, Girard won a national contest by making 25 of 25 free throws. As a seventh grader, he played on the high school’s freshman team. As an eighth grader, he scored the opening basket of his first varsity game and finished with 31 points, including a pull-up 3-pointer at the buzzer to win the game. As a ninth grader, he scored 52 points in one game. As a 10th grader, he once scored 41 points, grabbed 19 rebounds and fell one assist short of a triple double. Those are absurd numbers for almost any player, much less one in high school, where games last only 32 minutes, compared with 40 in college and 48 in the N.B.A.As a junior, he recorded his first dunk in a game. His cousin Trent, who is 5-foot-5, threw the ball off the backboard to Girard to earn the assist.“There are times when you say, ‘Jesus, that’s not a good shot,’ ” Rob Girard, the coach, said. “But when he hits four out of six of them, what can you say? You go with it.”Girard fired from all over last season. He scored 60 points in a game twice and never scored fewer than 41 points as his team went 20-3. He broke his own team record when he made 12 3-pointers in a game, and he stitched together four consecutive games with 50 points or more. When defenders locked arms while trapping him after he crossed the half-court line, the coach told his star to attack the linked limbs to force referees to call a foul. With seven games left in his junior season, he surpassed Los Angeles Lakers guard Lance Stephenson’s state-record 2,946 career points. In his final game as a junior, a sectional semifinal, Girard scored 56 points.“I saw those numbers, and I couldn’t believe it,” said the retired N.B.A. player Kenny Anderson, who scored 2,621 points at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens and held the state record for 15 seasons. “In 32 minutes. Amazing. Crazy. Wild. Regardless of who he is playing, with those numbers, I was like, wow, that kid is balling.”Girard was raised by a gunner. His father scored 2,179 points at St. Mary’s in Glens Falls and Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, N.Y., and is 44th on the state’s career scoring list. He later played for John Beilein at Le Moyne College in Syracuse. The Girard name is known all over Glens Falls. The boys and the girls basketball teams are each coached by a Girard. “For good and bad, Glens Falls is known as the Girard Town,” said Joe Girard III, who has two cousins as basketball teammates. “We’re all over the place.”Another family in town scored some points, too. When he was younger, Joe Girard III rode his bike to Sanford Street Elementary School and pedaled past Ogden Street, where he could see a growing collection of trophies in the Fredette family’s window. That a single city could produce these basketball look-alikes could just be coincidence, but while Jimmer Fredette was scoring 2,404 points at Glens Falls from 2003 to 2007, he also was working as a counselor at a basketball camp in town that had been held on fall Saturdays for decades. Girard was a camper there, just as Fredette had been. Fredette’s brother, T.J., remembered Girard being called upon at a basketball clinic to demonstrate a ball-handling drill. “He zipped right through it, spider dribble and all,” he said.By the time Jimmer Fredette earned national player of the year honors at Brigham Young, in 2011, Girard, 11 years younger, was being called the next Jimmer. Girard played one season for Tony Hammel, who had coached Fredette at Glens Falls, before Girard’s uncle took over the program. Girard walks by Fredette’s framed jersey outside the gym nearly every day.“There was always something just different about Joe,” Jimmer Fredette said in a phone interview from China, where he plays for the Shanghai Sharks and in November scored 75 points in a Chinese Basketball Association game. “He’s just broken every milestone by a long shot. He is a deadeye shooter, but I work with him on his middle game: floaters, runners, shots he can be creative with in college and beyond.”Girard used to hear chants — “Jimmer’s better!” — when he missed shots, but those faded in recent seasons. Still, as they did with Fredette, college coaches are figuring out where Girard fits moving forward. One of 32 players invited to try out for the United States’ under-18 team in Colorado in June, he did not make the final cut. Playing at Peach Jam, the main event of Nike’s Elite Youth Basketball League, in July, he was less of a scorer alongside center Isaiah Stewart, one of the nation’s top-rated recruits. Twice, Girard went scoreless against better competition.“He’s got to become a little more efficient in being able to maneuver his way into shots,” said Tom Konchalski, a talent evaluator and publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated, a scouting newsletter for coaches. “He’s not a point guard, but he has intergalactic range. If he’s patient, he can have a good career.”College coaches came to town to pitch their programs in the fall. Girard’s mother, Arleen, ordered from Panera Bread for most, but she made chicken parmigiana for Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. Phil Martelli, from St. Joseph’s, told Girard he should wear Bubble Wrap, but Girard absorbed his share of blows in football as a quarterback and defensive back. “I had a shoulder problem, so I used every other part of my body to tackle a guy; got a knee to the rib,” he said, recalling a hit that took his breath away. “Felt like I was going to puke blood, but my ribs were still there, so I played on. It’s senior year. I want to help these guys out.”Syracuse basketball fans made their pitch, as well. One night after coming home from a football game on the road, his mother noticed a round orange object glowing by their house. It was just before Halloween, but it didn’t seem right.“I thought our neighbor put an inflatable pumpkin on the front yard,” she said. “As I got closer, I saw the thing with a spotlight on the front and realized it was an inflatable Syracuse mascot. I panicked, got out, and tried to unplug it. I was thinking, What if other coaches saw photos? He hadn’t committed yet!”Girard later announced, in a ballroom at the Queensbury Hotel, that he would attend Syracuse. After a news conference, he called Gerry McNamara, the assistant coach who had recruited him. He treated the offer like a marriage proposal.“I do,” Girard said.The bromance moved to the back burner as Girard started his senior season. In the opener, he struggled to find his stroke. He missed his first free throw, but made his second. He then missed his first 11 tries from beyond the 3-point line before making one with 30 seconds left in the third quarter. He finished with 34 points in a 92-57 win.“Still getting my legs,” he said.He found them soon after. In his next game, he scored 41 points. In his third, 53. In his fourth, he missed his first six 3-point attempts and shot an air ball. Opposing fans chanted, “Overrated!” He motioned for them to raise the volume. Before sitting out for the last three minutes of a 96-65 victory, he had scored 57 points.“You lit it up,” his father, who tallies each point in his head and checks the score book after each game, told him. “Beyond lit up!”On a recent morning, Girard pulled up a chair at Poopie Di Manno’s Lunch, a greasy spoon with a salty owner. He ordered chocolate milk and a breakfast sandwich. As the waitress retreated to the kitchen, Marcia Winslow approached him.“I don’t want to interrupt you,” Winslow said. “But before you get superfamous, can you just give me a signature? You’re totally awesome.”“Thank you,” he said as he signed her menu.Winslow explained that she had a shrine to Jimmer Fredette in her house, a wall of things he had signed, including pictures. “Maybe you’re going to replace him,” she said.“I hope so,” he said. “We’ll see.”"
"TOKYO — Pete Pranica, the longtime television voice of the Memphis Grizzlies, appeared to be square dancing as he stood in a small conference room here, demonstrating for Japanese broadcasters the N.B.A. violation of thrusting out a hip while setting a screen.Viewers, he told his fellow commentators through an interpreter, expect “that you know all there is to know about the N.B.A.”For two days in late September, using a dry-erase board, video and a Power Point presentation, Pranica patiently and deftly explained everything from rules changes to team-by-team outlooks to preparing to broadcast a game. His attire — a Grizzlies polo shirt and khakis — was casual, but his message was not.The N.B.A. has had a presence in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, for three decades and has played 12 regular-season games here since 1990. Yet, some of the broadcasters attending Pranica’s workshop had little experience calling league games, having spent much of their careers covering baseball and soccer or high school basketball.Was it true, Pranica was asked, that the collective jersey numbers of the three referees at each N.B.A. game must not exceed 100?“Not that I’m aware of,” he said diplomatically.Hence, the urgency of Pranica’s seminar.In Japan, the N.B.A. is not viewed with the same fervor or depth of knowledge as in other Asian countries like the Philippines, where basketball is the No. 1 participation sport. In China, the top N.B.A. market outside the United States, an estimated 300 million people play the sport and 640 million cumulative viewers watched league programming last season.“The Philippines is a beacon for us when we think about the kind of popularity we’d love to see in markets like Japan,” Matt Brabants, the N.B.A.’s senior vice president for global media distribution and business operations, said in a telephone interview. “And we have to work at that.”To extend its footprint in Japan, the N.B.A. last season partnered with Rakuten, the giant e-commerce and internet company headquartered in Tokyo, to distribute its live games throughout the country. Rakuten, which aspires to rival Amazon, also became a global sponsor of the league in a multiyear deal reportedly worth $225 million.Separately, Rakuten became a jersey sponsor of the Golden State Warriors for a reported $60 million over three seasons. The company name appears on the team’s jerseys and practice facility.Rakuten represents the N.B.A.’s most inclusive media partnership ever in Japan. But while a number of Japanese baseball and soccer players have enjoyed prominent international careers, only one Japanese-born player has ever played in the N.B.A.Yuta Tabuse, a guard, played 17 minutes in four games for the Phoenix Suns in 2004 — not the kind of career that could enthuse a country as, say, Yao Ming’s Hall of Fame career in Houston did for promoting basketball in China.In an island nation like Japan where space is at a premium for its 127 million people, there are only 30 basketball playgrounds, which restricts the development of a playground culture, according to FIBA, the sport’s international governing body.In recent years, the management of professional basketball in Japan has been in turmoil. The Japan Basketball Association was suspended in 2014 by FIBA for operating two competing professional leagues.The matter was resolved, and the Japanese basketball federation was reinstated in 2015. The two pro leagues merged into what is now a three-tiered league called the B.League, which began play during the 2016-17 season and features relegation and promotion like a professional soccer league.Yet, the rules and tactics of basketball are not as widely understood in Japan as in the Philippines and China, said J.R. Henderson, a Californian who played on U.C.L.A.’s 1995 N.C.A.A. championship team and has played professionally in Japan since 2001.“It’s not about the N.B.A.; it’s about basketball,” Henderson said in a telephone interview. “They don’t understand the rules or substitution patterns, why timeouts are called at certain times in a game, how come sometimes the game is fast and why sometimes you slow it down.”Henderson, now 41, played 30 games for the then Vancouver Grizzlies during the 1998-99 N.B.A. season and has become a naturalized Japanese citizen known here as J.R. Sakuragi.He plays for the Aisin Seahorses of the Japan league’s top division. His teammates have an intimate knowledge of the N.B.A. and try to mimic its stars, Henderson said. Within his team, he said, “It’s no different than fans in the States.”Outside of his basketball circle, though, Henderson said, “You would have a hard time finding someone who knows who Carmelo Anthony is.”But opportunities are growing for Japan to become more familiar with the N.B.A.’s players. The Rakuten deal is giving the league broader exposure. A basketball magazine called Dabudori (Double Dribble) has been available for the last year. And dozens of N.B.A. stars are expected to participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.Yuta Watanabe, a rookie 6-foot-9 forward from Japan who played at George Washington, has signed a two-way contract with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2018-19 season, permitting him limited transfers from the team’s G League, or developmental teams.Rui Hachimura, a 6-8 forward who could be Japan’s top basketball prospect ever, is entering his junior season at Gonzaga. He is a mainstay on Japan’s national team and, according to Gonzaga, only the fifth Japanese-born men’s player to participate in Division I basketball.A Japanese player who could succeed in the N.B.A. “for more than a couple of games, say two or three years, would make a huge difference,” Henderson said.Another difference could come from the way fans watch games. In the recent Summer League, the N.B.A. experimented with a broadcast format called vertical view. It was spurred, in part, Pranica said, by the preference of Chinese fans to watch their cellphones in the upright or portrait position, instead of the sideways or landscape position, during crowded morning rail commutes, when live games are typically broadcast there from the United States. Presumably, Japanese fans would have similar interest in the vertical view format.The N.B.A. is now available in 215 countries in 50 languages. In the Philippines, N.B.A. officials said, the most sophisticated fans prefer English-language broadcasts by former coaches and players like Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson.“They have good input, and they’re funny,” Riel Cruz, a restaurateur from the Philippines, said while returning home on a flight through Tokyo after vacationing in the United States. “The Filipino guys, some of what they say is nonsense. They talk about what they had for breakfast.”Fans in Japan mostly prefer games described in their native tongue, with additional context beyond the shorthand of an American broadcast, N.B.A. officials said. The language of basketball here is mostly formal, without extravagant catchphrases, and many words are similar to their English counterparts. A dunk, for instance, is called a dunku.But there is also a marvelous economy to some of the basketball lingo. A flagrant or unsportsmanlike foul is simply called an “unspo.” And a basketball shoe is a “basshu.”Reo Onishi, who interpreted for Pranica at the workshop and writes for NBA.com Japan, said he hoped the voice of the Grizzlies might inspire Japanese commentators to spice up their own broadcasts.Referring to Pranica’s signature call when Memphis builds an insurmountable lead, Onishi laughed and said, “Every Japanese broadcaster will now be saying: ‘Hammer, nail, coffin. This baby is over.’”"
"There is a good chance that LeBron James might not be playing basketball in June of 2020, barring a big free agent signing or a trade. But someone will be onstage discussing him.“King James,” a play by Rajiv Joseph, will be making its world premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in May 2020, the Steppenwolf announced on Thursday as part of its 2019- 2020 lineup announcement, a diverse slate with a particular emphasis on people of color. Anna D. Shapiro will direct.The show will depict life in Cleveland after 2016, when the Cavaliers won the championship, as two friends “spar in a verbal game of one-on-one, revealing past secrets, present truths, and a possible future after ‘The King’ has left the building.” (Last summer, Mr. James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers.) The play will also be produced on the West Coast in Los Angeles, where Mr. James currently resides, as part of the Center Theatre Group’s 2020- 2021 season.Other highlights from Steppenwolf’s upcoming season include the debut of “Lindiwe,” a musical featuring works by the famed South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo (Nov. 7-Dec. 29, 2019). Tracy Letts, a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winner, will bring his play “Bug” to Chicago, which is slated to be directed by David Cromer (“The Band’s Visit”) and star Carrie Coon (“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, HBO’s “The Leftovers”) and Namir Smallwood (Jan. 23-March 8, 2020).Lauren Yee’s “The Great Leap,” which last year was at the Atlantic Theater Company’s Stage II in New York, will make a leap of its own to Chicago. Another play about basketball, the work tracks an American team’s trek to Beijing in the late-1980s (Sept. 5-Oct. 20, 2019).“The Brothers Size,” an early work of Tarell Alvin McCraney, is headlining Steppenwolf’s young adult programming (Oct. 2–19, 2019), as is the world premiere of “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” an adaptation of the book by Erika L. Sánchez, which will be directed by Sandra Marquez (Feb. 26-March 21, 2020)."
"At the Knicks’ practice facility in Tarrytown, N.Y., earlier this week, there were good fouls, bad fouls and push-ups. It all had to do with the rookie center Mitchell Robinson, whose defense in the first two months of his N.B.A. career has ranged from dazzling, as in nine blocks against Orlando, to disastrous, as in six fouls in nine minutes against New Orleans.So Knicks Coach David Fizdale made a deal with Robinson. “If he doesn’t do the foul where his hands are down, I got to do push-ups,” Fizdale said. “And if he does, then he has to do push-ups. So you might see my body change here. I’m about to get in shape, man. I hope I’m doing push-ups. Trust me, I hope.”The Knicks took a gamble on the 7-foot-1 Robinson when they selected him in the second round of the June draft with the 36th pick over all. He was the only player in this year’s draft who did not play in college, overseas or in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League. Instead, Robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft.Considered a top recruit coming out of Chalmette High School in Louisiana, Robinson committed to Western Kentucky, left campus before the season started, considered other colleges and then returned briefly to the Hilltoppers before finally deciding to skip college altogether. By that point, playing overseas or in the G League wasn’t an option.His muddled path led to him falling into the draft’s second round. “I probably would have been a different draft pick if I went to Western Kentucky,” Robinson said. “But I think I ended up in a good spot with the New York Knicks. I fell into good hands.”The N.B.A.’s one-and-done rule continues to draw a lot of criticism and could be repealed in the next few years, but until it is, players have to be 19 years old and a year out of high school before being eligible for the N.B.A. That yearlong gap has led to unconventional paths to the N.B.A., including Robinson’s improvised sabbatical and a decision by Darius Bazley to sign with a prominent agent and secure an internship and shoe deal at New Balance while he waits to become eligible for the league.But do these less traditional paths to the N.B.A. ultimately matter if the end result — a spot on an N.B.A. roster — is the same? “Yeah, it matters,” Fizdale said. “Absolutely it matters. There’s no other way to substitute playing for a year, especially at that age. That’s a big development year, especially for a young kid. Same with Emmanuel. He didn’t play a lot of games over in China, so he basically missed a year of competition learning basketball and the ins and outs of five-on-five competition.”Fizdale was referring to Knicks guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who was also a top prospect coming out of high school, in Texas. After committing to play for Larry Brown at Southern Methodist, however, he decided to instead accept a one-year, $1.2 million deal to play for the Guangdong Southern Tigers, one of the premier teams in the Chinese Basketball Association.“When I made that decision, our lives changed,” Mudiay said in explaining his decision. “My mom was working a few jobs at a time. We were on food stamps. I barely got to see her at times. Everyone was doing everything they could to get by.”Playing in China was another stop on an arduous journey. Mudiay was born in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). After his father died when he was young, the family emigrated to Dallas, where his mother raised her three sons.But Mudiay’s time in China was challenging, too, in part because he was sidelined for three months after an ankle injury. Still, he said he wouldn’t change a thing. “That decision was strictly for her,” he said in reference to his mother. “I didn’t even need that money. I’d rather give that all to her.”In the 2015 draft, Denver selected Mudiay with the seventh overall pick. But after failing to meet the team’s expectations, he was traded to the Knicks in a three-way deal last February.Now a regular in Fizdale’s revolving lineup, Mudiay is averaging 12.9 points and 3.3 assists a game after a career-high 34 points and 8 assists on Friday night in a 126-124 overtime win at Charlotte. “He’s really coming along,” Fizdale said. “He’s really taken some long strides from where he was until now.’’It’s also easy to forget that Mudiay is only 22, given his circuitous route to the Knicks. “People think I’m 28 or 29,” he said. “Even guys on the team.”Those teammates, including Robinson, have had a challenging time this season. The Knicks are 9-21 heading into Sunday’s game in Indiana against the Pacers, and their only star, Kristaps Porzingis, is still recovering from the serious knee injury he sustained last February.But what the Knicks do have, at least, is potential, since so many players are still so young. Like Mudiay, Allonzo Trier, a 6-5 guard who has been one of the bigger surprises in the league this season, is just 22. The undrafted rookie, who played three seasons at Arizona, signed a two-year deal with the Knicks on Thursday that is worth $7 million.In June’s draft, the Knicks opted for Robinson over Trier with their second-round pick given their need for a big man. And in light of his time away from competitive basketball, Robinson, who is just 20, has been the team’s most ambitious work in progress the last few months. Against Charlotte on Friday, he sprained his ankle and had to leave the game. X-rays were negative, but for now he will do his learning on the sideline, still trying to make up lost time.“We probably coach him the hardest because he’s the most raw out of all of them, but he’s a joy to work with,” Fizdale said. “Can you imagine that? You come out of high school and you sit out for a whole year and now you’re standing in the middle of Madison Square Garden.”Or else doing push-ups. Though the push-up agreement between Fizdale and Robinson has been limited to practices, the coach isn’t ruling out a game-time “give me five” if the reach-in fouls continue.“I might make him do it if he gets a couple in a row,” Fizdale said. “In front of the whole arena.”"
"The Indiana Pacers named Kelly Krauskopf, a longtime W.N.B.A. executive, as their new assistant general manager.The team announced Monday that Krauskopf, who spent 19 seasons as the top executive for the Pacers-owned Indiana Fever, would join the Pacers’ basketball operations department on Jan. 1 alongside the team president, Kevin Pritchard; General Manager Chad Buchanan; and Peter Dinwiddie, the vice president for basketball operations.Several women hold front-office jobs in the N.B.A., including Orlando’s Becky Bonner, Oklahoma City’s Amanda Green, Atlanta’s Michelle Leftwich, Toronto’s Teresa Resch, Houston’s Ariana Andonian and the Nets’ Natalie Jay — with Denver also recently hiring the W.N.B.A star Sue Bird. But Krauskopf will be the first woman to receive the title of assistant general manager in the N.B.A. since the 1970s, when Nancy Leonard had the role for the Pacers. Her husband, Bob Leonard, was the coach.“It was her and I with the Pacers,” Bob Leonard, known as Slick, told The Indianapolis Star in June. “Nancy ran the business side, and I was responsible for the coaching.”Pritchard told the newspaper Monday that Krauskopf’s role would focus “strictly on basketball.”“As the architect of one of the W.N.B.A.’s most successful franchises, Kelly is a true pioneer in our sport,” the Pacers’ owner, Herb Simon, said in a statement. “I’ve worked with Kelly over the past two decades, so I know her tremendous basketball mind, strong work ethic and proven leadership skills will continue to be of great benefit to our organization.”Krauskopf began working in the W.N.B.A. league office in 1996 and joined the Pacers’ organization in 1999 when they were granted a W.N.B.A. expansion franchise. For the past year-plus, she has also been an e-sports executive, overseeing the Pacers’ NBA2K league team.“The chance to work in an N.B.A. front office for a first-class organization filled with great people I know and in a city that has become my home is extraordinary,” Krauskopf said in a statement. “My past experience has shown me that building winning teams and elite level culture is not based on gender — it is based on people and processes.”The Fever made 13 playoff appearances under Krauskopf’s leadership as team president and general manager, including three trips to the W.N.B.A. finals, and a league championship in 2012.The Pacers are off to a 20-10 start and again rank as one of the league’s most surprising teams. They outperformed preseason projections last year by going 48-34 after acquiring the All-Star guard Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis from Oklahoma City in June 2017 in a much-debated trade for Paul George. Indiana has risen to third in the East this season even though Oladipo recently missed 11 games because of soreness in his right knee."
"ATLANTA — Kyle Kuzma had his first interaction with LeBron James a little more than a year ago, when Kuzma was a first-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and James was a few months from dragging the Cleveland Cavaliers to another appearance in the N.B.A. finals. Kuzma had reached out by phone, hoping for some tips.“Just wanted to see how one of the greats takes care of his body and has so much longevity,” Kuzma recalled this week in an interview. “Everybody wants to play basketball for as long as possible.”So much has changed since that initial conversation. Kuzma and James are teammates now, and Kuzma is experiencing the unique challenges that come with playing alongside one of the game’s behemoths. At the same time, James’s body finally betrayed him this season, which has only heightened the sense of urgency within the organization: The Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for five years running, are not in position for a patient rebuild.James, at 34, may still be in his prime, but the stakes are already high for a franchise that desperately wants to maximize his time in Los Angeles. And while neither James nor Lakers management has shown much enthusiasm for coaxing along a young core — the Lakers tried to ship half the roster to New Orleans last week — they are stuck in this together. James was supposed to be the savior of a flagship franchise gone astray; salvaging the final months of this year would be a key indicator that he still wields that type of power.“We have to approach the rest of the season just like you would during the playoffs,” Kuzma said.As Kuzma recalled his talk with James, he had no way of knowing that the Lakers were mere hours from suffering one final implosion before the N.B.A. All-Star break — a 117-113 loss to the Atlanta Hawks that left the team with a losing record and ample opportunity for soul searching.“It’s time for us to get away and reflect a little bit about where we are as a group,” Coach Luke Walton said. “I think this first part of the season, we’ve gone through a lot of adversity. And we’re probably not where we want to be, but we’re still close enough.”Close enough, that is, for vying for a spot in the playoffs, which was both an indication of the team’s modest goals and its sad reality. At 28-29, the Lakers are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings. It is unfamiliar territory for James, who has not been on a losing team this late in a season since he was a first-year forward with the Cavaliers.“But with LeBron on your team, anything is possible,” said Mychal Thompson, a power forward for the Showtime-era Lakers and an analyst for the team’s radio broadcasts. “I mean, look at some of the teams he’s taken to the finals — including last season. He’s capable of doing great things if you just get on board and run with him.”The Lakers, though, seem fragile after nearly five months of drama — all of it stemming directly or indirectly from the $154 million deal that James signed to join the team last summer. The pressure was on from the start, and little has gone according to plan.“There’s been more noise this year,” Walton said, “but that was to be expected with the moves in the off-season. That was something to be anticipated.”Where to begin? Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo were suspended for trying to brawl with the Houston Rockets two games into the season. Magic Johnson, the team’s outspoken president of basketball operations, chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting for the team’s slow start, igniting lasting questions about Walton’s job security. Nearly every player on the roster has been injured, and that includes James, who missed 17 games with a strained groin.And lest we forget: Last week, Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka tried to trade away nearly half the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans for Anthony Davis, who, before the start of the season, hired the same agent who represents James. It was the clearest sign yet that Johnson is willing to attempt the very boldest moves — no matter the residual damage.Consider that the Lakers, amid their ultimately fruitless effort to pry Davis away from the Pelicans, lost by 42 points to the Indiana Pacers. And with rumors of which Lakers would be traded swirling through social media, it was difficult to find arguments in their defense — even from James himself.Kuzma, who was offered up as one of the pieces in a potential deal, said it had been difficult to drown out the noise.“It’s definitely tough,” he said, “because this generation, you’re always on your phone, always on social media, always seeing it somewhere on TV.”But the trade deadline passed, and the roster more or less remained intact. There had been a sense that a surprising win against the Boston Celtics on Feb. 7 would galvanize the team in the wake of so much uncertainty. And even after losing to the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, the Lakers still had a chance to build some momentum against the Hawks on Tuesday.Before the game, James appeared to be in an upbeat mood. In the locker room, he knelt on a giant inflatable ball as he worked on some core-strengthening exercises. He crooned the lyrics to “Plug Walk” by the hip-hop artist Rich the Kid. He made small talk with Ingram. It was all vintage James.About three hours later, once the Lakers had punctuated their loss with a turnover, James made a beeline off the court and into the tunnel. He was practically steaming. He had finished with his fifth triple-double of the season — 28 points, 16 assists, 11 rebounds — but the Lakers’ defense was as porous as a coffee filter, and the result was just as messy.“I can throw that game in the trash,” James said.In a three-minute postgame session with reporters, Kuzma mentioned the concept of “fun” five times — specifically, the notion that the Lakers were not having much of it.“A lot of times we’re out there with sad faces, very focused faces,” Kuzma said. “But I think we’re at our best when we’re having fun.”Fun may not be the primary objective for James, and the psychic effects of the loss are sure to linger until at least Feb. 21, when their season will resume after the All-Star break with a home game against the Houston Rockets. For now, though, the best thing for these players may be to be away from each other for a while, which was one of Walton’s suggestions before they parted for the break.“Spend some time by yourself,” he said, and added: “I think we’ve got a group that will be ready by the time we get back.”"
"Before last summer, every top N.B.A. draft pick of this decade had signed a sneaker endorsement contract with Nike or Adidas. DeAndre Ayton, this year’s No. 1 pick, did not.“We were dealing with Nike people, Under Armour and all the other shoe companies,” he said soon afterward. “We just thought Puma was the right fit.”Marvin Bagley III, the second pick, went with Puma, too. He said in an email that he chose the company because “they’re willing to do things differently, which is what I like about them.”If Puma started the 2018 insurgency against the traditional shoe powers, New Balance joined the rebellion last month. Multiple news outlets reported the company had landed a deal with Kawhi Leonard after he turned down a multiyear contract worth $22 million from Nike. In October, New Balance revealed it had signed the much-hyped prospect Darius Bazley to a million-dollar contract. Bazley, 18, is not yet in the N.B.A. He is interning with the company and training for the draft instead of playing a “one and done” year in college.Not to be outdone, Under Armour added Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers’ charismatic young center, to its roster days before the season began, beating out competition from Puma and New Balance. He joined Stephen Curry and Dennis Smith Jr. on the Under Armour payroll.The rush of upstart brands signing N.B.A. players is a testament to the league’s ever-expanding popularity; even being tangentially associated with the league gives the brands some credibility with young consumers, they insist. Which is a good thing, given that experts say the shoes themselves may tank.“The headline for us when it comes down to why are we getting back into basketball after 20 years is culture culture culture culture culture,” said Adam Petrick, Puma’s global director for brand and marketing. “The N.B.A. and all the other entertainment mechanisms around it, whether it’s ESPN or Complex magazine, are attuned to creating a 24-hour news cycle around basketball. In our day of mass news media mass consumption, we have the option to benefit from that.”Mark Bartelstein, a top N.B.A. agent whose client Gordon Hayward recently signed with the Chinese shoe company Anta, said the companies were battling for a piece of the basketball business because “the money follows what is hot, and the N.B.A. is very hot.”Executives at Puma and New Balance, eager to justify major investments, were quick to agree, pointing to the outsize influence of a league with a global footprint that extends beyond sports. They say that it has never been more important to be associated with the N.B.A.As Bagley put it, Puma’s “culture is not strictly basketball — it’s a full lifestyle brand that not only supports me as a basketball player, but also as an artist.”And yet Puma may be making this bet at precisely the wrong time, as the market for basketball shoes is bottoming out.According to Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at NPD Group, basketball shoes now account for just 4 percent of the shoe market, down from a high of 13 percent a few years ago. Performance sneakers — shoes worn for athletic activity — are doing poorly more generally.Consumers, Powell said, are now more interested in looking like athletes than they are in imitating their abilities.“This is the peak of the athleisure trend,” he said. “They just want to look the part. If you are going after looking the part, you don’t need to spend $150 on a top-end basketball or running shoe.”Executives like Petrick say they are not concerned.“Most people don’t wear performance sneakers for performance,” he said. “So when we’re trying to appeal to our core consumer, it’s not going to be just around the features and benefits of the product, it’s going to be around the brand perception. Being a part of basketball culture means that we’re a part of culture, period.”Puma announced its re-entry into basketball in March, signifying the rebirth of a product line that had last been associated with Vince Carter in the 1990s. New Balance’s history in the N.B.A. dates back even farther. James Worthy and M.L. Carr were endorsers in the 1980s, but as Nike became dominant and endorsers started earning millions of dollars, New Balance largely exited the sport.In recent years, the most prominent player to wear New Balance was the San Antonio Spurs’ redheaded sharpshooter Matt Bonner. Though he wasn’t a paid endorser, Bonner’s goofy-dad image was then a perfect fit for a brand that for years did not even attempt to be cool and proved very successful at falling well short of vogue.New Balance would not confirm that it had signed Leonard, whose strong play for the Toronto Raptors has helped his team become a favorite to make the N.B.A. finals. Chris Davis, a vice president for global and sports marketing at New Balance, would only say that any brand would be lucky to have Leonard.Davis said New Balance had put together a 12-year plan to become the third-largest athletic brand in the world. It wants to grow from $4.5 billion in revenue to $7 billion by 2023, meaning third place behind Nike and Adidas is an extremely lucrative place to be. And any strategy for global growth now requires investing in basketball.“It is the second-biggest global sport,” he said, adding that New Balance’s two biggest markets are the United States and China, where basketball is huge. And New Balance, like Puma, has also ventured into street style: A collection of shoes created in tandem with the streetwear label Kith was released late last month.For shoe companies, however, it isn’t enough for N.B.A. players just to wear their shoes off the court. Though the vast majority of buyers will never wear their shoes to play basketball, if shoes aren’t worn on the court by players, they are seen as inauthentic.New Balance also buys into the current industrywide belief that both athletes and consumers are more open to so-called challenger brands — brands that go after the lords of the realm — than ever before. There have never been as many shoe companies vying for sneaker free agents as there are today, a trend that started in earnest five years ago when Under Armour signed Curry.Unlike its competitors, Under Armour is content to stay a performance-first brand, unless its athletes dictate otherwise. Asked about slacking sales for performance shoes, Ron Johnson, the general manager for global basketball at Under Armour, was sanguine.“I feel like there’s always going to be headwinds and challenges in various categories, whether it be seasonality or the cyclical nature of trends,” he said.Performance sales could pick back up. But Powell, the NPD analyst, was not optimistic. He pointed out that plummeting sales for performance shoes went beyond basketball. Whether it is running, tennis, training or any other athletic activity, performance footwear has fallen out of fashion. Last year’s best-selling shoe was Nike’s Tanjun, which is similar to the Nike Free running shoe but costs half as much.Puma’s Petrick acknowledged the challenges for signature basketball shoes, but he said that creating separate silos for performance footwear and off-court footwear was not a genuine reflection of how the industry worked. He doesn’t care all that much whether fewer pairs of the $185 LeBron James signature Nike shoes are flying off the shelves.“I can tell you that LeBron is wildly relevant as a cultural icon to our core consumer,” he said. “So why wouldn’t I want to inhabit this space?”"
"LOS ANGELES — To celebrate their first home win in 25 days, the Lakers on Sunday dropped streamers that had been collecting dust from the ceiling at Staples Center. The final lineup of the night included Alex Caruso, a 25-year-old guard who spent most of the season in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League.Caruso knows things were not supposed to be this way. His mere presence — in a crunchtime situation, no less — was a vivid sign that the season had gone sideways for the Lakers, who will be watching the playoffs from various vacation destinations.Caruso also knows that the Lakers are playing fairly meaningless games, including Sunday’s 111-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (32-41) have nine more of these to go, starting Tuesday against the Washington Wizards. The buzz of LeBron James’s first season as a Laker is gone. The roster will be overhauled again this summer as the franchise, which has not been to the playoffs since 2013, rummages for solutions.“But for me,” Caruso said, “these games are really meaningful.”The Lakers are searching for motivation wherever they can find it, especially as they head toward an off-season of uncertainty. Coach Luke Walton’s job status is tenuous at best, and 10 players on the current roster do not have guaranteed deals for next season. Some of them, like Caruso, are trying to showcase their skills in hopes of acquiring N.B.A. work next season.“I think this little stretch has been really good,” Caruso said, “because it’s finally allowed me to put all that work I’ve put in over the last two years and show how much I’ve evolved as a player. That I’m gaining confidence and making strides to get better and better.” In 16 appearances for the Lakers this season, Caruso has shot 44.6 percent from the field, averaging 6 points and 2.2 rebounds.Even players who figure to be a part of the franchise’s future are focusing on personal growth. A team is always a collection of individuals, but the Lakers’ late-season emphasis on “me” is particularly understandable.“I need to use these games to develop myself and play with the ball more,” the second-year forward Kyle Kuzma said recently.The Lakers were not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 17 — that would happen five days later — but Kuzma stood by his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immediate future.“I’m just trying to use these last 13, 14 games — whatever we have — to just try to develop good habits,” he said. “Season’s pretty much over, so that’s the only thing I can really do. Everyone knows I’m a good scorer and I can do that. I’m just trying to complete my game.”Then there are the injured players who have largely disappeared from view: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart. For them, the end of this season is about rehabbing for the next one.After all the losses, injuries and general dysfunction, Walton continues to preach the importance of team play. Same as ever.“It starts with our effort and how we play and how we compete,” he said. “And our guys have been doing a nice job of that, even though we haven’t been winning games. Whatever lineups we’ve been putting out there, they’re giving what they have. So that’s the No. 1 thing.”As for James, these are his first truly inconsequential games since his rookie season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who finished well out of playoff contention. But even then, he could use the end of the season as an opportunity to hone his abilities and gain experience for future endeavors — such as eight consecutive trips to the N.B.A. Finals.So it is a credit to James, even as the grease fire of his first season with the Lakers smolders, that he is out there — trying. Against the Kings, he finished with his 81st career triple-double: 29 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds. How does he sustain the motivation?“If he’s out there on the court, he’s going to give what he has,” Walton said. “That’s probably a better question for him, but I’m getting to know him, and that’s the type of person he is: He respects and loves the game. So if he’s going to play, he’s going to give what he has.”James said he appreciated the fans who continued to show up. He also said he owed it to himself to play with genuine effort.“I’ve always respected the basketball gods,” James said, “and if I’m on the floor, I got to try to play as hard as I can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game.”Still, times have changed for the Lakers, who have not been to the playoffs since 2013. Before that, they routinely fixated on the Western Conference standings and the number of wins they would need to make the playoffs. Now, the most important number in their universe is 3 percent — as in, their odds of winning the N.B.A. draft lottery.Then again, the Lakers are not the only team that has so little at stake at this stage of the season. Look no further than the Kings, whose push for a playoff berth has deteriorated in recent weeks. Before Sunday’s game, Coach Dave Joerger held a brief news conference. No one had much to ask.“I can give you some more stuff,” he said. “I mean, it’s sunny out. It’s spring. It smells like March Madness, Lent and the N.B.A. playoffs. Get the seedings, get it done. Exciting times.”He paused again.“Nothing else?” he asked.Nothing else."
"The N.C.A.A. said on Saturday that it was appealing a Federal District Court’s decision this month that barring athletes from being paid beyond a scholarship and related costs violated antitrust law.“We believe, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that N.C.A.A. member schools and conferences are best positioned to strengthen and revise their rules to better support student-athletes, rather than forcing these issues into continuous litigation,” Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, said in a statement.Remy said the decision to appeal, by the N.C.A.A. and the major college conferences named as defendants in the suit, was unanimous.The ruling this month by Judge Claudia Wilken in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California was actually far more favorable to the N.C.A.A. than the plaintiffs, a class of Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and football players, had hoped.The suit, known as Alston after a lead plaintiff, argued that the N.C.A.A.’s rules barring payments to players — the center of what the association terms the collegiate model, and what is broadly known as amateurism — was illegal collusion. It asked the court to declare as much, and to eliminate all such rules, leaving it up to individual conferences to set caps independently if they so chose.Instead, while Judge Wilken agreed that the rules were illegal, she found that an alternative, in which the N.C.A.A. continued to restrict payments unless they were tied to education, was acceptable. Under her ruling, colleges could give athletes items like computers, but the N.C.A.A. could continue to bar them from receiving cash in express exchange for their athletic contributions.Judge Wilken cited a 2015 ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a similar case, in which a three-judge panel partially insisted that payment to athletes be “tethered to education.” The same appellate court — albeit probably three different judges — would hear this appeal.While the N.C.A.A. largely welcomed Judge Wilken’s finding when it was handed down, it said on Saturday that it sought more: to get the courts out of regulating college athletics as much as possible.“While the district court upheld the distinction between full-time students who play college sports and professional athletes, it erred by giving itself authority to micromanage decisions about education-related support,” Remy said.Jeffrey Kessler, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of the appeal in a text message on Saturday morning: “We are not surprised. It was a major defeat for the N.C.A.A.”"
"Sports curses come in all shapes and sizes. They can involve livestock, soup commercials, magazine covers and, frequently, the selling of star players.In recent years, the rapper Lil B has made a name for himself in the sports realm with his curses — most notably on James Harden of the Houston Rockets — but it appears he has some new competition: the rapper Ja Rule.It all started on Saturday, when Ja Rule was performing at halftime of a game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the host Milwaukee Bucks.The performance came on the 17th anniversary of Ja Rule’s collaboration with Ashanti, “Always Be On Time,” hitting No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. But the show came under criticism immediately because of a somewhat misleading video of the crowd reaction and another one showing an unexpected guest: Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks’ star forward, who came out to begin warming up for the second half while Ja Rule was still performing on the court along with a group of dancers.The rapper initially shrugged off the criticism, but his tone changed when the Timberwolves decided to mock the performance on social media. In a post to Twitter, the team said “We too were hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!” The post was a reference to an earlier post by Ja Rule about his role in the ill-fated Fyre Festival, a luxury music event in the Bahamas that failed spectacularly in 2017. The rapper was not amused.The potential effects of this particular curse are unclear, though. The Timberwolves have existed as a franchise for 30 seasons and not only have not won a championship, but they have only made it out of the first round of the playoffs once — in 2004. They are 28-31, putting them just outside legitimate playoff contention, and the notion that Karl-Anthony Towns is departing anytime soon — as Ja Rule suggested with “AND KAT IS LEAVING!!!” — seems unlikely, as he has signed a five-year contract extension that kicks in next year and guarantees him nearly $160 million.Of course, logic does not have to play a role in sports curses. The Chicago Cubs endured the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat for more than 70 years after the team asked the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, William Sianis, to leave a game because his goat was bothering fans. That the team had not won a World Series in more than 30 years before the episode was treated as mostly irrelevant. Other popular curses have included one in which the athletes endorsing Campbell’s Chunky Soup seemed to become injured at an extraordinary rate. Another claimed that athletes had their performance fall off after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated.The most famous, of course, is the Curse of the Bambino, which doomed the Boston Red Sox to lose after selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in December 1919. The jinx is credited by some with keeping the Red Sox from winning a World Series for 86 years, despite the first year of that stretch coming before the team sold Ruth, and the fact that the curse was barely mentioned in popular culture before George Vecsey wrote a column about it for The New York Times in 1986. Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe also wrote a book in 1990 that popularized the phrase.At the very least, the talk of Ja Rule’s curse was good news for Lil B, who spent part of the weekend trending on Twitter. He celebrated by retweeting various people saying Ja Rule was simply stealing a tactic that Lil B had already perfected."
"It was a humble TV listing, informing readers that the Knicks would be playing the Washington Bullets on MSG that night. The short item noted that “The Knicks tried double-teaming Jeff Ruland in the second of those games, but the tactic didn’t work: He responded with a triple double-digit effort — 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.”It was Dec. 29, 1984. And for the very first time, The New York Times had cited the triple-double.On Monday night, Russell Westbrook completed an unprecedented 10th consecutive triple-double, with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Portland Trail Blazers. Westbrook broke the record of nine, set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1968.But while triple-doubles are no longer uncommon — Westbrook’s teammate Paul George turned in an even more immpressive line (47 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists) on Monday — the term is relatively new. Like Chamberlain, some of the greatest practitioners made every one of their triple-doubles when triple-doubles were not even a thing.The Times quickly embraced the triple-double. Two days after its debut, the label made it into an ordinary sports article, this time without the clunky words “digit” or “effort.” Precedent had been set.In those early days, some of the references to triple-double in The Times were in quotes, as if editors were afraid that the new term would pollute the newspaper’s august pages. Eventually the arbiters of style settled on no quotes, and a hyphen in between the two words.The first triple-double in Basketball-Reference’s database is from 1950, when Andy Phillip of the Philadelphia Warriors tallied 17 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, although there were almost certainly others before that when stat keeping was less precise and complete.Harvey Pollack, the longtime 76ers stats guru, is generally credited with inventing the term in the early 1980s, inspired by Magic Johnson, who made a habit of triple-doubling. (Ruland, though he was the Times’s triple-double pioneer, claimed only five in his career.)There are also double-doubles — the career record is held by Chamberlain — and quadruple doubles, for those who can also manage 10 blocks or steals. That has only happened a handful of times in the N.B.A., and not since David Robinson in 1994.There are even quintuple doubles, a stupefying exploit — 25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals and 10 blocks — performed by the women’s star Tamika Catchings when she was in high school in 1997.Westbrook has taken the triple-double to new heights, though, actually averaging a triple-double for the last two seasons. He is on pace to do so again this season. And unlike his early predecessors, he is keenly aware of the stat, often looking to add that one more assist or rebound that he needs late in a game.Westbrook now has 127 total triple-doubles, closing in on Johnson, the inspiration for the term, who has 138.But above all of them is Oscar Robertson, the only other man to average a triple-double; he had 181 in his Hall of Fame career.His last one came in 1974, when the feat was still unnamed, at least in The Times."
"LOS ANGELES — At the midpoint of the N.B.A. season, Kyle Kuzma was daydreaming about something the Lakers have yet to unveil: a small-ball lineup with LeBron James manning the center position. The Lakers already generate the third-highest pace in the league using a traditional lineup, so imagine the possibilities.“That small-ball lineup is going to be huge for us,” Kuzma told reporters on Wednesday morning, “especially in the playoffs when everybody’s going to be going small.”Kuzma, a second-year forward, was making two assumptions: first, that the Lakers would make the playoffs, and second, that they would have enough time to experiment with the lineup and refine it ahead of a hypothetical trip to the postseason. Not to stamp all over Kuzma’s enthusiasm, but neither of those is a guarantee given the way the Lakers’ hodgepodge season has gone.Coach Luke Walton, to his credit, is taking a more pragmatic approach. Though he entered the season hoping to unleash a smaller lineup that could cause mismatch problems, the Lakers do not have time to mess around with experiments, he said, not right now, not after their recent struggles, not with their continuing rash of injuries and absences.“It’s going to get tougher to do,” Walton said, adding: “As the season gets further and further down the road, those, ‘Hey, let’s try this during the game’ — it’s going to be less and less because we’re in a pretty nasty fight for who gets in and who’s not in. So it will be more about what we’re good at, and try to get better and better at that.”Every team copes with injuries of varying magnitudes, and the Lakers have dealt with their share. On Wednesday night, LeBron James — no longer indestructible, apparently — missed his eighth consecutive game with a strained left groin, but he looked upbeat on the home bench at Staples Center during his team’s 113-100 victory against the Detroit Pistons.“I thought our team showed a lot of growth from, however you want to call it, the post-LeBron injury,” said Walton, whose team improved to 23-19.An important caveat: The Pistons, who have lost 15 of their last 19 games, are not playing stellar basketball. But the LeBron-free Lakers are beginning to look more cohesive and more confident than they did in the days after they lost him to his injury on Dec. 25. They have won two straight, with James’s return date still uncertain.After the Lakers’ medical staff evaluated James on Thursday, the team announced in a statement that he was progressing and had been cleared “to increase on-court functional basketball movements.” He is scheduled to be re-evaluated next Wednesday, but in the meantime the Lakers will play on without him, starting Friday against the Utah Jazz.James’s absence — however long it lasts — may not wind up being the worst thing for the Lakers. His workload over the past decade-plus has been immense, with most of his seasons extending through the N.B.A. finals. He just turned 34. Assuming he returns at full strength, without complications, James could probably benefit from a midseason break.More important, perhaps, has been the opportunity for the team’s lesser lights to operate on their own. The training wheels are off. For a while, it looked bleak. The Lakers lost five of their first six games without James, and it got bad enough that Kobe Bryant logged on to Twitter to defend Walton from an angry mob.“Relax,” Bryant, one the franchise’s most iconic figures, wrote in a post on his account. “Entire squad is damn near out.”At the time, the Lakers were without James, Kuzma and Rajon Rondo. Rondo could miss another two to three weeks after undergoing surgery on his right hand (for the second time this season), but Kuzma, who was sidelined for two games with a back contusion, has since returned.On Monday, with the rust from his injury still apparent, Kuzma shot 4 of 20 from the field in a win against the Dallas Mavericks. On Tuesday, an off day for the Lakers, he went to the practice facility and took 500 shots, Walton said. On Wednesday, Kuzma scored a career-high 41 points in 29 minutes while shooting 16 of 24 from the field.“If you would have told me two years ago, when I was in college, that I would score 40 for the Lakers, I probably wouldn’t have believed you,” Kuzma said. “Kind of crazy.”But this is his reality at age 23, and Walton said he was also pleased with the aggressive play of Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, who are both 21. They are learning as they go, and their curriculum has been more advanced in recent days.At the same time, the Lakers have emerged as a surprisingly respectable defensive team. Entering Thursday, they ranked eighth in the league in overall defensive rating.Asked what he knew about his team at this stage of the season, Walton said: “We know that when we’re at our best, we’re a really good team. We know that we’re a team that can hang our hat on playing defense and getting stops. We’re good when we get out and run. LeBron James is really good.”But really, Walton said, there are probably more unknowns than knowns with this group. On only a handful of occasions has he had close to a full roster at his disposal. The rest of the league will be interested to see what the Lakers look like when he finally does."
"More than a dozen former athletes at the University of North Carolina, including several star basketball players, appeared Friday to have helped scuttle a plan to display “Silent Sam,” a Confederate monument toppled by protesters in August, in a new campus history center.The university’s board of governors was set Friday to consider a proposal to build a $5.3 million center that would house the 105-year-old statue, which has been condemned by critics as an enduring tribute to white supremacy.The university said last year that “removing the Confederate monument is in the best interest of the safety of our campus,” but a 2015 state law required a state historical commission to approve of its removal from campus grounds.Shifting the statue to a history center, where it could be displayed in proper context, was put forward as a compromise proposal. But Friday morning, just hours ahead of the board meeting, a local magazine published an open letter by the athletes that accused the university of using black students as “accessories” and criticized the athletic department for not taking a stand on the monument, in light of the high proportion of black athletes on many of its most prominent teams.“We helped to tell the story that Carolina is the ‘University of the People,’” the athletes wrote in the letter, whose signers included the former Tar Heels Jerry Stackhouse, Vince Carter and Harrison Barnes. “We love U.N.C. but now also feel a disconnect from an institution that was unwilling to listen to students and faculty who asked for Silent Sam to be permanently removed from campus. The recommendation is embarrassing to us who proudly promote U.N.C.”Shortly after the letter was published in Spectacular Magazine, which covers communities of color in central North Carolina, the university board said it would not support the plan. A separate letter from less prominent Tar Heel athletes, former and current, was also sent to university and state officials. Among its signers are five members of the men’s basketball team.The letters represent the latest instance of athletes, predominantly African-American ones, taking stands in favor of social justice. This phenomenon of mixing politics with sports has a long lineage, but in recent years it has included the Missouri football team’s brief boycott in 2015 of an impending game and the former N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling during the national anthem.Stackhouse, who played for the Tar Heels for two seasons in the 1990s before a nearly two-decade N.B.A. career, posted the letter to Twitter Friday afternoon.Protesters toppled the statue in August amid national friction over monuments to the Confederacy. Silent Sam had long been a source of controversy on the Chapel Hill, N.C., campus, but the debate was further inflamed by the fatal eruption of racist violence a year earlier in Charlottesville, Va.At a news conference Friday afternoon in advance of the No. 12 Tar Heels’ game versus No. 4 Gonzaga on Saturday, North Carolina’s men’s basketball coach, Roy Williams, said he had told his players to sign the letter if they wanted to.“My own personal opinion,” added Williams, who graduated from the university, was an assistant coach and is now in his 16th season as head coach, “is I wish we didn’t have a situation where we would put him back on campus.”In a statement Friday afternoon, an athletics department spokesman said, “Our student-athletes understand they have the right to freely express themselves, which is why more than 200 of them have signed the petition.”In the most prominent intercollegiate sports, football and men’s basketball, the disconnect between players, on the one hand, and coaches and administrators, on the other, can seem especially stark, given racial discrepancies between the two groups and because N.C.A.A. rules prohibit athletes from receiving compensation for their participation beyond scholarships and related costs.Black athletes made up the plurality of Division I football players and the majority of Division I men’s basketball players in the 2016-17 season, even as most of their coaches were white, according to Richard Lapchick, who leads the sports business program at the University of Central Florida.The main letter’s signers, who also included more recent stars such as Theo Pinson and Justin Jackson, singled out the athletic department’s silence in the face of the Silent Sam controversy.“We would have liked to have heard the opinion of the athletic department leadership and coaches regarding this disposition of Silent Sam,” they wrote. “Especially in light of the high number of black athletes who have participated on the basketball, football and track and field teams over the history of Carolina athletics. Their silence is very glaring and tells us a story.”The University of North Carolina has one of college basketball’s most beloved and accomplished programs. It has won five national titles in the past four decades and groomed Michael Jordan and other stars. Jordan’s name was not on the letter.The university came under fire in recent years over a widespread academic scandal involving athletes, in which dozens of football and basketball players maintained athletic eligibility via a “shadow curriculum” of phony classes, frequently requiring no attendance and just one paper."
"DENVER — Moments after the Golden State Warriors finished obliterating the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night, Draymond Green was asked about a teammate who did not even play — a teammate, in fact, who has yet to log a single minute this season but is nearing his much-anticipated debut.“Hopefully,” Green said, “it’s devastating for everybody else.”Let that soak in for a second. The Warriors, who have won three of the last four N.B.A. championships, are already good at basketball. All they did on Tuesday was set an N.B.A. record by scoring 51 points in the first quarter — the first quarter! — against a team that came into the game with the best record in the Western Conference.But now, after signing DeMarcus Cousins over the summer and spending recent months incorporating him into their dynastic fold as he recovered from Achilles’ tendon surgery, the Warriors expect him to be in their starting lineup when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. It is a grand experiment that will play out over the second half of the season.“More than anything, we’re just excited for DeMarcus,” Coach Steve Kerr said late Tuesday night, adding: “It’s going to take him some time to get his rhythm.”Cousins, a 28-year-old center and a four-time All-Star, has not played since Jan. 26, 2018, when he tore his left Achilles’ in a game for the New Orleans Pelicans. At the time, Cousins was having a career season, with averages of 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists a game. He was also due for free agency and an enormous payday.But his type of injury has ended careers, particularly among big men, and every team in the league balked at offering him a long-term deal. He wound up with the Warriors, who signed him to a one-year contract worth $5.3 million — a modest price for a reclamation project with upside and little obvious risk.“It’s a relief,” Cousins told reporters last week. “It’s been a long year for me, a lot of ups and downs, but the finish line is ahead.”There is no way of knowing if Cousins, who is listed at 6-feet-11 and 270 pounds, will ever be the top-tier player he once was. But the Warriors neither need nor expect him to be a focal point of their offense, and if he merely commands attention from defenders, especially in the post, he should free up additional space on the perimeter for the team’s cavalcade of shooters.“We haven’t had a player like him before, so it will be new,” Kerr said. “It won’t be a simple ‘plug him in and he’ll fit right in.’ We’ll play through him some, so there will be a period where we have to adapt. Fortunately, we’re halfway through the year. We have a lot of games to figure this out.”Since the Warriors began collecting championships under Kerr in 2015, they have had a rotating cast of dependable but unspectacular centers: Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli, Zaza Pachulia, JaVale McGee. Cousins has never been a role player, though he acknowledged his new (and unfamiliar) place in the Warriors’ ecosystem.“Well,” he said, “I won’t be taking as many shots as I have in the past.”He also has a reputation for being emotional, and something of an antagonist. Some of the Warriors have firsthand experience. Kerr recalled getting ejected after arguing with the officials in a game against the Sacramento Kings in 2017, back when Cousins was playing for them. But before he left the court, Kerr caught Cousins taunting him by waving goodbye.Then there was an episode last season, when Cousins was playing for the Pelicans, and he got into an altercation with Kevin Durant. After both players were ejected, Cousins tried to track down Durant outside the Warriors’ locker room — and not to exchange pleasantries.“It shows that you care,” Cousins said of playing with passion. “It shows that it means something to you. I’m not really fans of the guys who are emotionless on the floor.”Nuggets Coach Mike Malone, who briefly coached Cousins in Sacramento, said he enjoyed the experience.“I loved coaching him,” Malone said. “I think he’s a player that’s misunderstood, and when you have a chance to know him, you realize who he is as a player and as a person. And when he’s healthy, he’s one of the more unstoppable big men in the N.B.A.”Malone compared Cousins to Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets’ fourth-year center and an emerging multidimensional force.“He can score inside, and he can score outside,” Malone said of Cousins. “He can handle the ball, and he can make his teammates better.”Malone said he expected that Cousins would give the Warriors “a big lift,” and Malone made those remarks before the Nuggets’ 142-111 loss to the Warriors.The Warriors have had their struggles this season, although these things tend to be relative. Green beefed with Durant. Stephen Curry missed 11 games with a strained groin. Klay Thompson labored through an early-season shooting slump that he refused to acknowledge as an early-season shooting slump. And they have lost more games than they usually do.The Warriors have been rolling of late, though, winning seven of their last eight before their game against the Pelicans on Wednesday night. They appear to be playing their best basketball of the season, as evidenced by their demolition of the Nuggets, a rout so thorough that Malone said it would be impossible for his team to just “flush” the loss and forget it.But now, as the Warriors get ready to introduce Cousins to their explosive mix, there are questions: Can he play with pace? Can he acclimate himself to a supporting role? Can he defend quicker players if opponents go small against him? And most important, can he stay healthy and find his old form ahead of the playoffs?The Warriors are eager to find out."
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — After two weeks of Anthony Davis’s trade request dominating conversation around the N.B.A., Commissioner Adam Silver on Saturday sounded sanguine about any possible negative effects it was having on the league.“Some of the greatest players in the history of this league have demanded trades at various points of their contracts,” he said at his annual All-Star weekend address. He went on to say that there was “very little” he could do to completely stop players from trying to force trades.Davis was fined $50,000 for the public trade request made by his agent, Rich Paul. Silver said it was healthy for players and their agents to have ongoing conversations with their teams about future intentions, but that he preferred that such conversations happen behind closed doors. As for the frenzy of news media attention surrounding Davis and his possible destination this summer, Silver said the “public spectacle” wasn’t the type of media interest the league wanted.“We certainly are becoming a 52-week-a-year sport, and it’s largely the result of tremendous interest in these players,” he said. “I think we could do a better job as a league in avoiding those situations where they get to the point where players are maybe demanding they be traded or, worst-case scenario, saying, ‘I’m not going to honor my contract.’”[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo’s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame]Silver has frequently stated a desire to improve the N.B.A.’s competitive balance. Asked whether small-market teams could compete with large-market franchises, Silver largely disputed the premise without even citing the fact that the Milwaukee Bucks, a small-market club, currently have the best winning percentage in the league.He took the opposite approach.“I’m not even sure where the line is anymore on big markets,” he said, pointing out that the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls — teams that play in major cities — have struggled on the court in recent years.Silver also said it was too early to judge whether reforms to the draft lottery, intended to reduce the incentive to tank in pursuit of a high draft pick, were having the intended effect. Four teams this year are on pace to win fewer than 20 games, but Silver said there is also an unusually large number still in contention for a playoff berth.“I personally don’t think it is a winning strategy over the long term, losing for multiple years,” said Silver. He also said that choosing to be uncompetitive for an extended period of time would most likely have a “corrosive’’ effect on any team that took that approach.Taken together, Silver’s responses to questions suggested that he was relatively happy with the state of the N.B.A. and believed that the league’s problems could be solved through tweaks to the system, not wholesale changes.Silver opened the news conference by addressing House Bill 2, the law passed in North Carolina in 2016 that invalidated local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the genders listed on their birth certificates. In response to the law, the N.B.A. took the All-Star Game, originally scheduled to be played in Charlotte in 2017, away from the city.He said it was the view of the league office that the law discriminated against the LGBTQ community, and subsequently the N.B.A. made the decision that it was “inconsistent with the values of this league to play the All-Star Game here under those circumstances.” The N.B.A. decided to return after the law was partially repealed.Asked about efforts to improve the culture of the Dallas Mavericks, where a league investigation found numerous instances of sexual harassment and improper conduct among employees, Silver offered few specifics but said there was a “complete sea change in culture on the business side” of the organization.Earlier Saturday, the N.B.A., in partnership with the International Basketball Federation, announced the formation of the Basketball Africa League, a 12-team professional league made up of clubs from across Africa. The league will begin play in 2020, the first time that the N.B.A. will be involved in the operation of a league outside of North America.Many details, including which clubs from which countries will be part of the league, have yet to be finalized, but Silver did say that former President Barack Obama would be involved in the league in an unspecified capacity."
"[Want to read more from Marc Stein? Sign up for his free weekly newsletter here.]Andrew Bogut made his return to the N.B.A. on Wednesday, signing a rest-of-the-season contract to rejoin the Golden State Warriors. The reunion came two years to the day since Bogut, the former No. 1 overall selection in the 2005 draft, sustained a gruesome leg injury.Bogut, 34, spent this season starring for the Sydney Kings in his native Australia and, by his own admission, was convinced “that the N.B.A. door had shut.”But the Warriors began lobbying Bogut to rejoin them in December and made it to March with a roster opening for the 7-foot center, who wasn’t available to be signed until the Kings’ season ended last weekend.“I was kind of blown away,” Bogut said in a telephone interview from Australia. “This wasn’t a situation where I threw my hat in the ring to try to get signed in the N.B.A. I wouldn’t do that.“To come back to the N.B.A., for me, was basically Golden State or nothing. But the fact it was Golden State — it was the kind of opportunity that I would be kicking myself if I didn’t take.”When Bogut signed a two-year deal with Sydney last April, he described it as “my official retirement from the N.B.A.” He proceeded to win Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year honors in Australia’s National Basketball League, averaging 11.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.7 blocks per game.Bogut’s contract with Sydney does not contain an N.B.A. release clause, but he told the Warriors that he would entertain the prospect of rejoining them on a short-term basis after the Australian season — as long as Sydney officials blessed it — should Golden State still have a need.Had the Warriors succeeded in landing a recent free agent from the so-called “buyout” market — such as the swingman Wesley Matthews, who opted to sign with Indiana after securing his release from the Knicks — they would have had no roster room for Bogut.But once it became clear that the Chicago Bulls would refuse to release the veteran center Robin Lopez before March 1, thus missing deadline for Lopez to retain his playoff eligibility with a new team, Golden State intensified its pursuit of Bogut as soon as the Kings were eliminated from the N.B.L. playoffs.As the Warriors continue to try to assimilate the former All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins into their rotation, Bogut said he had “no illusions” about the fact that “some games I’ll play and some games I won’t.” But Bogut insisted he was “happy to be a positive influence on that bench” no matter how much he plays.The Warriors assistant general manager Larry Harris, who was Milwaukee’s general manager in 2005 when the Bucks selected Bogut with the top pick in the draft, made a recent scouting trip to Australia to assess the state of Bogut’s game firsthand and convey the seriousness of Golden State’s interest.Warriors Coach Steve Kerr referred to Bogut as “an insurance policy in the frontcourt.” But Bogut’s defensive know-how and his familiarity with the Warriors’ star trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green certainly can’t hurt the league’s prohibitive championship favorites in the quest to improve on their woeful standing of 16th in defensive efficiency (109.5 points allowed per 100 possessions.)“I didn’t foresee this happening but I’m excited as hell about it,” Green told Bay Area reporters. He and Bogut quickly meshed as co-anchors of a vaunted Golden State defense in 2014-15, when the Warriors began their five-season run of dominance.After the Warriors won a league-record 73 games in 2015-16 but blew a 3-1 lead to the LeBron James-led Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals, Bogut and the veteran forward Harrison Barnes were quickly jettisoned to Dallas to create the requisite salary-cap space for Golden State to sign Kevin Durant.Bogut, though, said that returning to the Warriors nearly three years later to play alongside Durant would not “be weird” despite the contentious nature of his departure.“The Golden State Warriors are a very special organization in my heart,” Bogut said. “I had a lot of great years there and won a championship. Even though they moved me, it was understandable to get a guy like Kevin Durant. I probably would have traded myself if I had the same opportunity.”It was Bogut’s longtime agent, David Bauman of Independent Sports and Entertainment, who first pointed out to him that Wednesday’s signing with the Warriors coincided with the two-year anniversary of the fractured tibia in his left leg that Bogut sustained 56 seconds into his Cleveland Cavaliers debut in March 2017.“It’s just funny how the world works sometimes,” Bogut said. “This is an unbelievable opportunity that I’m really thankful for.”"
"Jarrett Allen is not scared of anyone on the basketball court. Not even LeBron James.On Tuesday, as the Nets hosted the red-hot Los Angeles Lakers, Allen proved it when James, a 6-foot-8, 270-pound bulldozer of a human being, drove into the lane and elevated toward the basket, just as he has done nearly 2,000 times in his 16-year career. Allen, a few inches taller than James but about 30 pounds lighter, did not give way. He shifted into position, reached up with his right hand and got clean contact on the ball, sending it off the backboard as he crashed to the floor after the collision. James pleaded for a foul, but no call came. The lane, in that moment, belonged to Allen, and the game, on that night, belonged to the Nets, who went on to win, 115-110. After the game, Allen said he could not even understand trying to contest dunks with any sort of fear. “It was my quote growing up: ‘Either way, you’re going to be on the highlight,’” Allen, a second-year center, said. “So just go up and protect the rim.”The reaction to the block was swift online — much of it focusing on the rarity of seeing James fail at one of the things he does best. By the calculations of ESPN Stats & Information, it was the 1,850th dunk attempt of James’s career, and just the ninth time one had been blocked. When a reporter relayed that statistic to Allen, the young center initially mouthed, “Wow.” He added: “I’m on the list forever now.”It might be surprising to some that Allen, playing in just the 102nd game of his career, would be on that list. But it wouldn’t shock Blake Griffin, himself an all-time great dunker who found himself in the same position as James earlier this year. But when it comes to blocks on James, how does Allen’s rate against some of the other fortunate rejections over the years?The blocks range from the relatively mundane, like when Myles Turner managed to get back in time to block an attempt in 2016, to the purely ridiculous, like when Gerald Henderson was credited with a block on a dunk attempt despite replays showing that the ball had gone through the basket and bounced off his head and back out.There was an emphatic block by Terrence Jones, and a fairly nasty one by Kevin Durant (which most likely did not make ESPN’s list, as the game’s play-by-play categorized it as a layup attempt). But none of those, not even Allen’s, could compare to the one pulled off by Mason Plumlee in 2014, when he was a rookie with the Nets. That one, once you consider the context of the game, and the offensive player involved, could easily be described as one of the most significant blocks in regular season history.It was April 8, 2014, and the Nets and James’s Miami Heat were in the final seconds of a close battle, with the Nets up by 88-87. Rashard Lewis, trapped by two defenders under the rim, passed backward to James, who came surging toward the hoop. Meeting him there was Plumlee, a 24-year-old out of Duke playing in the 66th game of his pro career. Plumlee leapt in front of James, and, while he did not get hard contact on the ball, he redirected it enough to send it off the backboard and into the arms of a teammate as time expired, with James arguing with referees while Plumlee openly celebrated on the court. Even Plumlee’s coach, Jason Kidd, was shocked by the play, and struggled to give his player credit for pulling it off.“That’s just basketball,” Kidd told reporters. “You have the best player in the world going against a rookie and we got lucky.”But Plumlee, like Allen, took the play mostly in stride, and made it clear that he had no plans to alter his style in the future.“It’s winning time, so it doesn’t matter — Dwight, LeBron, whoever — they’re coming at you, you just have to meet them at the rim,"" Plumlee said, referring to Dwight Howard, then of the Houston Rockets. “I’m sure I’m going to play a long time, and there will be times I get dunked on. But they’re going to have to go through me or over me.”It’s a sentiment that Allen clearly shares, and one that opponents will have to be aware of as the Nets, who have won six straight, continue to emerge as a team to be reckoned with."
"With all of the trade drama surrounding Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis, the N.B.A. intruded on the N.F.L.’s run-up to the Super Bowl as we have not seen since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on football’s so-called Championship Sunday in 2006.Now that the Super Bowl is over and even more of North America’s sporting consciousness is there to be seized by professional basketball’s tireless headline-makers, here is our best advice: Buckle up.What follows is a by-the-numbers look at what the N.B.A.’s 73rd season has served up so far — and what the next five months hold.Through Sunday’s games, only the Milwaukee Bucks were on a 60-win pace. The Bucks’ Eastern Conference-leading record of 38-13 projects to a 61-win campaign — which could keep this season from being the league’s first since 2000-1 without a 60-win club.There are realistically 11 teams battling for the Western Conference’s eight playoff spots, after the new calendar year began with 14 teams in the conference — all but Phoenix — in the race. Dallas, New Orleans and Memphis have dropped off in January, prompting all three teams to focus more on trades than the standings.The consensus top three in the Most Valuable Player Award race coming out of Super Bowl weekend are Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Houston’s James Harden and Denver’s Nikola Jokic. According to the Basketball-Reference.com M.V.P. Award Tracker, Antetokounmpo awoke Sunday with a 37.8 percent chance of winning — far ahead of Harden’s 21.1 percent.Harden has scored at least 30 points in 26 consecutive games, good for the third-longest such streak in N.B.A. annals behind Wilt Chamberlain’s streaks of 65 and 31.The league’s trade deadline (Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern) is three days away. This is the second season since 1978-79 (as far back as reliable N.B.A. record-keeping goes) that the deadline falls before the All-Star Game.The New Orleans Pelicans have made two trips to the playoffs — winning only one series — in Davis’s first six seasons with the team. Davis requested a trade on Jan. 28.It took 54 days for the Minnesota Timberwolves to find a trade they liked for Jimmy Butler after Butler’s request to be dealt became public Sept. 18. Butler was snubbed by East coaches in All-Star voting, but the potential ceiling for Philadelphia’s rugged new star threesome was evident Thursday night at Golden State, when Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Butler and Company brought a halt to the longest winning streak of the season — after the Warriors had won 11 in a row.Minnesota is 21-18 since the trade that sent Butler and Justin Patton to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 — and 6-6 since firing Tom Thibodeau, the coach/team president who made it, on Jan. 6. Ryan Saunders, Thibodeau’s 32-year-old replacement, has many admirers around the league, but the Wolves are a long way from convincing skeptics that the deal (to bring in Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick) was sufficient for a player of Butler’s caliber.Thibodeau is one of three coaches to be fired this season — after nine coaching changes in the off-season. The other coaches to lose their jobs since opening night: Cleveland’s Tyronn Lue and Chicago’s Fred Hoiberg.There were 20 teams, entering Sunday’s play, attempting at least 30 3-pointers a game. This is poised to become the first season in N.B.A. history that the leaguewide average per game (31.4) will finish in the 30s.With coaches calling for more 3-pointers than ever before and greenlighting shots earlier and earlier in the 24-second shot clock — along with a new rule that resets the shot clock at 14 seconds on offensive rebounds — teams are averaging 100.0 possessions per 48 minutes leaguewide. The last N.B.A. season in which that figure finished in triple digits was 1988-89 (100.6).Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton, Orlando’s Nikola Vucevic, Philadelphia’s Simmons and Denver’s Jokic will make their All-Star Game debuts Feb. 17 in Charlotte, N.C. The All-Star player draft, in which the captains LeBron James and Antetokounmpo will fill out 13-man rosters by picking players playground-style, is Thursday at 7 p.m. — just four hours after the trade deadline passes. (D’Angelo Russell of the Nets, who was named later as a replacement for Indiana’s Victor Oladipo, who is injured, will also be making his All-Star debut this year.)Four teams are in contention for the league’s worst record: Phoenix (11-43), Cleveland (11-42), Chicago (12-41) and, of course, the Knicks (10-42). The teams that finish in the bottom three will share a 14 percent chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in June in the first year of the league’s revised lottery system.San Antonio sits a surprising fifth in the West, at 32-22, in its first season since trading Kawhi Leonard to Toronto in July. The Spurs are bidding for a record 22nd consecutive playoff berth, a streak that began in Gregg Popovich’s first full season as Spurs coach in 1997-98.At 27-25, Sacramento is on course to post its first winning record since the 2005-6 season. But the Kings will have to leapfrog at least two teams to stop the league’s longest playoff drought (12 seasons). The Suns (nine seasons) and the Orlando Magic (seven) are on course to extend their own playoff droughts.The Lakers’ playoff drought will hit a hard-to-believe six seasons in a row if James cannot save Los Angeles over its final 29 games. James just missed 17 consecutive games with a strained groin — the longest injury absence of his pro career — and is at risk for missing the postseason for the first time since his second N.B.A. season, in 2004-5.Carmelo Anthony finally became an unrestricted free agent on Sunday after clearing waivers nearly three months after the Houston Rockets sent him away in November after just 10 games together. The Rockets traded Anthony to Chicago on Jan. 21; the Bulls, who needed a roster spot, waived him Friday without him spending a single second with the team.In the seven games Golden State has deployed a lineup of DeMarcus Cousins, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, that group is averaging 127.1 points per 100 possessions in 54 minutes. Call it a small but ominous sample size.Oddsmakers in Las Vegas have the Warriors as overwhelming favorites to win their third consecutive championship and fourth in five seasons. According to ActionNetwork.com, Golden State is -225 to win it all, meaning that you would have to bet $225 to win $100. Boston, Milwaukee and Toronto are next in line at +1,000, meaning that a $100 bet would win $1,000 if any of those teams won the title.One scribe’s ranking of the top 10 players who could be unrestricted free agents July 1: Durant, Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Thompson, Butler, Kemba Walker, Cousins, Middleton, Marc Gasol and Tobias Harris.The N.B.A. playoffs start April 13."
"ORLANDO, Fla. — Mo Bamba returned from a preseason workout with the Orlando Magic to a full apartment. He was greeted by three friends, whose sole business is the business of Mo Bamba, and by several employees of Wayfair, the online home goods company that had furnished his new downtown penthouse as part of an endorsement deal. All Bamba needed to do was pose for pictures.“This is excellent, guys!” Bamba, 20, said as he tumbled onto his new bed and spread his arms, which nearly extended into the living room. Bamba, a rookie center from Harlem, has a new home in Orlando and a new job with the Magic, who will play the Knicks on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. He is seven feet tall, with room to grow. He wants to develop a consistent outside shot. He wants to become one of the league’s sturdiest defenders. But he also has ambitions that go beyond basketball, and he wants to do things his way.“One thing that drives me crazy,” Bamba said during an appearance on “The Shop,” a real-talk show from LeBron James on HBO, “is when people tell me that I sound good for an athlete.”He continued: “They be like, ‘You don’t sound like you from Harlem.’” What, he wondered, is that supposed to mean?Bamba is riding a wave of rebellion in professional basketball, powered by talented young athletes who are determined not to let others’ expectations constrain their ambitions. The N.B.A. is big business, and players — even unproven ones like Bamba — are small corporations unto themselves. But Bamba wants to be in charge of his future.He does not, for example, have an agent, a rarity among N.B.A. players. What he does have is Lenox Partners, which he co-founded with Greer Love, 36, a childhood mentor who left his job in private equity last spring to launch the company. Love described it as “the umbrella entity that manages all the various facets of Mo’s life,” ranging from investments to philanthropy to sponsorship deals.“It’s about trying to surround Mo with the best experts possible,” said Love, who has an M.B.A. from Michigan and recently bought a home in Orlando. “If he sees something that interests him, we try to find the best expert to get him from Point A to Point B.”Beyond the business stuff, there is a unique partnership at work here — a bromance, even. Love has known Bamba since Bamba was in the fourth grade.“He’s been pretty darn consistent as the years have gone on,” said Bamba, who first came to know Love as a volunteer basketball coach at his elementary school. “I remember when this dude was begging me to send him my math problems so he could help me out.”Lenox Partners has two other employees: Noah Coslov, whom Love brought on for marketing help, and Denario Watkins, Bamba’s best friend since the third grade. After Bamba was picked by the Magic, Watkins drove a U-Haul full of Bamba’s stuff from his training base in California to his new home in Florida.Now, out on his balcony, Bamba was struggling with the midday glare as the Wayfair people set up their photo shoot. Love handed him a pair of sunglasses.“Dad shades,” he said before handing them back to Love, who shrugged.Another thing about Bamba: While he leans on people like Love and Watkins, he tends to do what he wants to do. “Mo trusts Greer,” said Shaka Smart, who coached Bamba during his lone college season at Texas. “Greer has been a real rock for him in terms of stability and guidance in some aspects of his life. But in other aspects of his life, Mo is incredibly self-sufficient: ‘I’m good. I don’t need help with this.’”Growing up in Harlem, Bamba shared an apartment with his mother and three siblings. (His father moved out when Bamba was 7, but they remain close.) They lived across the street from public housing, which Bamba’s mother discouraged him from visiting. Bamba’s parents are from the Ivory Coast, and he recalled getting into scuffles with other boys. “The children of African immigrants were always getting hazed,” he said.But the courts at the projects had the best hoops, so Bamba evaded the watchful eye of his mother. He caught the attention of the neighborhood, though, eventually becoming somewhat of a local legend who would inspire a rap anthem, the viral “Mo Bamba” song by his friend Sheck Wes, before his first professional game.Bamba built his legend as he began to shoot baskets at P.S. 208, where Love, then a 26-year-old investment banker, was volunteering on the weekends.Love had gotten involved through New York Cares, a nonprofit that pairs volunteers with organizations looking for help. He wanted a break from his 80-hour work weeks, he said, and the school needed someone to run a clinic for 60 or so children a couple times a month.“They would roll out 20 basketballs,” Love said, “and it was basically, ‘Hey, just make sure nobody kills each other.’ ”Bamba and Watkins were among the boys who showed up, and Love soon hatched the idea of tryouts for a fifth-grade team. It remains a source of friction that Love cut Bamba at tryouts. Love said it was because Bamba was in the fourth grade. But so was Watkins, and he made the team.“Yeah, pretty messed up,” Bamba said.Bamba joined the team the following year, and Love became more mentor than coach, a big brother of sorts who would help all the players with their homework and their problems. Love eventually left for business school but pledged that he would still be a part of their lives.“My promise to these guys was, ‘Hey, I’m just a text away,’” he said.Bamba, whose mother pushed him to excel, left New York, too, to attend boarding school in New Hampshire. He was not a basketball prodigy — not yet, anyway. He was studious and curious, with interests in math and history.Bamba later attended Westtown School outside of Philadelphia, where he emerged as a basketball star. He put Love, who was then working in Detroit, in charge of his college recruitment. They were methodical, creating a spreadsheet of Fortune 500 executives from the schools Bamba was considering. He chose Texas and its enormous pool of alumni.“Academics were certainly important,” said Smart, his college coach, “but he also wanted to connect with people and build a network that he could utilize and rely on for many years.”After one season at Texas, Bamba made his way to Barclays Center in June for the N.B.A. draft, where the Magic made him the sixth overall pick. He had his own cheering section that included a group of students from P.S. 208. Bamba has kept in close contact with many of his former teachers.“There’s so much ugliness in the neighborhoods, so when you have someone who can really make it out, it just inspires everybody — even the administrators,” Jackie Colon, the assistant principal at P.S. 208, said in a telephone interview. “If we can touch the life of one kid, we’ve done a good thing.”Bamba, who addressed the school’s most recent batch of graduates as a guest speaker, said he wanted to use his cachet to promote and invest in childhood education. He said he had recently spent time with David Robinson, who, since retiring from the N.B.A., has been a driving force behind a public charter school movement in San Antonio.As for Bamba’s business partnerships, Love is aware that some people might be skeptical of his intentions — namely, the optics of Love latching onto a rising star. It was an issue that surfaced last summer, when one of Bamba’s half brothers accused Love of providing Bamba with benefits that violated N.C.A.A. rules. Love was cleared of wrongdoing.“It definitely did affect me, because it happened out of nowhere,” Bamba said. “But time kind of heals everything.”For his part, Love said he just wanted to help children when he met Bamba nearly 10 years ago.“I had my own career long before this,” Love said. “And if I had to place a bet on somebody becoming this superstar — there was just no way. I wish I was that good at making predictions.”Bamba, who is the type of person to fill a hand-soap dispenser with water to make it last longer, is adjusting to his new circumstances as a pro living in an apartment with sweeping views of his new city. He is guaranteed more than $10 million through his first two seasons. Before he was even drafted, he used the money from a promotional appearance to move his mother into a new apartment in Manhattan. That was a dream fulfilled, he said.Still, Orlando’s coach, Steve Clifford, has tried to curb expectations. The Magic are not banking on Bamba from the outset. Through his first 10 games, Bamba came off the bench to average 6.5 points and 6 rebounds.“I hope people are fair with him, that’s all,” Clifford said.Bamba knows to be patient, too. Reflecting on his journey, he recalled leaving Harlem and heading to private school.“I remember when I first got there, I didn’t even know the proper dress code,” he said. “I didn’t really know what was going on. But I eventually figured it out.”That has been a theme throughout his life. He figured out how to cope with the teasing of neighborhood children. He figured out how to find the most competitive games. He figured out how to navigate the complexities of life in Harlem. And now, with a little help from his friends, he is determined to figure out the N.B.A."
"DALLAS — Dirk Nowitzki has seen many things in his 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. What he had never seen, until last month, was a fellow Maverick who could attract nearly two dozen autograph seekers in subzero temperatures to greet the team bus on a Thursday morning in Detroit.Luka Doncic did just that in the 2 a.m. hour of Jan. 31, as the Mavericks pulled into a hotel adjacent to the world headquarters of General Motors, on the unglamorous end of a back-to-back set that began in New York.It is likewise safe to presume that none of Nowitzki’s other 197 teammates over two decades in Dallas could have inspired what happened mere hours later. In a swift-moving blockbuster trade, Dallas acquired Kristaps Porzingis from the Knicks to serve as Doncic’s sidekick, with Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson openly admitting that he pushed for the deal because Doncic has “fast-forwarded a lot of our decision-making.”These are the tales from just one day, albeit maybe the wildest day, of what Nowitzki frequently refers to as Lukamania.“When we get to cities now, even late at night, there are so many people waiting with things for him to sign that it’s almost like we’re the Warriors,” Nowitzki said. “Lukamania is real. We’re living it every day.”[Another Rookie: The Perimeter Can’t Protect You From Mitchell Robinson]This week brings another milestone for Doncic, who celebrates his 20th birthday on Thursday. He is averaging 20.9 points, 7.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists through 56 games and is responsible for four of the five triple-doubles in N.B.A. history recorded by teenagers. It is a start that has quickly validated Nelson’s long-held belief that Doncic possessed superstar potential.The only other rookie in league history to hit those levels over a full season was Oscar Robertson in 1960-61.“I love, love, love guys that can pass the ball,” Nelson said, prioritizing Doncic’s ability to run a team at 6 feet 7 inches over the fact he is already known for having the league’s second-most-feared step-back jump shot, behind only James Harden’s.“I knew I could play over here,” Doncic said, “but it’s better than I expected, for sure.”The gaudy numbers and worldwide interest in his exploits enabled Doncic to amass more than four million votes in N.B.A. All-Star balloting, trailing only LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Doncic, in other words, finished higher in leaguewide balloting than Michael Jordan (fifth) did as a rookie. Higher, too, than James (13th) and even Yao Ming, who could manage only the fourth-highest total in 2003 despite the considerable voting might of Yao’s native China.Doncic’s instant production has also validated every pundit who insisted, amid no shortage of skepticism, that concerns about Doncic’s athleticism and corresponding ability to deal with the length of N.B.A. defenders were folly given the rampant success he achieved both at the club (Real Madrid) and national team (Slovenia) levels as an 18-year-old. In the process, Doncic has unleashed a torrent of second-guessing upon the teams (Phoenix, Sacramento and Atlanta) that let him slip to the Mavericks. Yet Doncic insists his maiden N.B.A. season, which appears destined to be christened with the league’s rookie of the year trophy, has not been as easy it looks.The Mavericks, you see, were 26-34 entering Wednesday night’s home date with Indiana and likely to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season. They have traded away all four of Doncic’s projected fellow starters (Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes) in deals that netted Porzingis and roughly $30 million in salary-cap space, neither of which can help the team this season.It is the first time in Doncic’s life, since he took up basketball at age 7, that he has experienced losing. One hint of how well he’s coping with it: Doncic has pulled his jersey apart in frustration after a play gone awry — twice.“It’s harder than people think,” Doncic said.“He’s a winner — he won everything in Europe,” Juancho Hernangomez of the Denver Nuggets said. “So every time he loses, he gets so mad.”Hernangomez has been observing Doncic from close range for years, both on the floor — since Doncic played alongside Hernangomez’s brother, Charlotte’s Willy Hernangomez, at Real Madrid — and through their shared WhatsApp chat room, which houses various European players fond of the popular video game Fortnite. But Mavericks officials are not worried about a scouting report from a friend that paints Doncic as a sore loser.“He doesn’t handle losing well — I know that for a fact,” Dallas Coach Rick Carlisle said. “But I don’t handle losing well, either.”As recently as May 15, Mavericks executives were worried about Doncic — big time. Having known for more than a year that they wanted to draft him if they had the chance, team officials were crestfallen in Chicago when Dallas slipped from a projected No. 3 in that night’s draft lottery to No. 5. “It was devastating for us,” Nelson said. “We thought our chance to get him was gone because it’s really hard to trade up in the lottery.” Nowitzki betrayed a public hint of the organization’s disappointment when he tweeted this reaction: “Of course.”To move up high enough, Dallas ultimately had to persuade the Atlanta Hawks to surrender the No. 3 overall pick. It cost Dallas both the No. 5 pick, which Atlanta used to take Trae Young, as well as the Mavericks’ top pick in the 2019 draft. But the Dallas owner, Mark Cuban, blessed the deal, even at that price, because Nelson lobbied so hard for it. Five years earlier, during the 2013 draft, Nelson and his longtime international scout, Tony Ronzone, pushed for the Mavericks to use the No. 13 pick on a little-known Greek teenager named Giannis Antetokounmpo. Cuban wouldn’t allow it, given that Antetokounmpo, unlike Doncic, was mostly a mystery — and promptly regretted it as Antetokounmpo blossomed into a star in Milwaukee.So this time, after the disappointment of the lottery, Cuban blessed Nelson to do whatever it took to land Doncic. What the team got was the son of a former Slovene pro — Sasa Doncic — and a veteran of three full seasons in the EuroLeague and Spain’s La Liga with Real Madrid after Luka Doncic made his pro debut at 16.To the Mavericks’ delight, Doncic was more N.B.A.-ready than they ever dreamed — as his 16-for-29 shooting in the final three minutes of one-possession games this season would suggest. As Carlisle put it: “Unique background, unique skill set, unique body type.”“I hesitate to throw out names like LeBron James and Magic Johnson, who have been do-everything kind of stars, but it’s pretty clear now that Luka has many of those same traits and has proven that he can do a lot of those things,” Carlisle said. “He has deceptive size, strength and quickness — and an understanding beyond his years on how to use his body to make plays and draw fouls.”Carlisle is hardly alone in making such lofty comparisons. Miami’s Dwyane Wade, one of the league’s foremost James experts after their four seasons together with the Heat, has called Doncic’s passing “LeBron-like.” Los Angeles Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said of Doncic: “He’s my favorite player to watch almost, and not talking just rookies. First of all, he plays with a great joy — I love that. And he’s just so advanced in the way he plays. The sky’s the limit for him. Wait until he gets in shape.”Rivers was laughing when he tacked on that last line, but he did hit on a prime area of Year 1 concern with Doncic — conditioning.The Mavericks and Doncic’s representatives, headed by the longtime N.B.A. agent Bill Duffy, agreed shortly after the draft to impose as much rest on Doncic as possible from July through September after a nonstop run at the highest levels of international basketball for nearly a year. Doncic thus began the season heavier than his listed weight of 218 and has absorbed jibes about his diet ever since.But Mavericks officials are pleased with the gradual changes in Doncic’s dietary habits. At the team’s behest, Doncic hired a chef in December to prepare a number of meals for pregame and off-night consumption. Doncic has also begun working fresh juices into his routine.In Madrid, Doncic lived for the past two and a half years with his mother, Mirjam Poterbin, who raised Doncic while running two beauty salons in Ljubljana. (Doncic has long declined to discuss his father.)In Dallas, mom and son live separately near the American Airlines Center as Doncic grows into his independence, but still within walking distance.“This was his dream,” Poterbin said. “At 7 years old he was already talking about N.B.A. I cry a lot of times.”Yet there have been Year 1 challenges and disappointments for Doncic amid the Lukamania — and beyond the ever-present adjustment to playing for a team with scant postseason prospects.He watched helplessly as his fellow Spanish-speaking teammate J.J. Barea suffered a season-ending Achilles’ tear in January. He lived through his first big trade, seeing Dallas abruptly abort its planned Doncic/Smith Jr. partnership when the chance arose to acquire his pal Porzingis.“I was shocked,” Doncic said. “Europe doesn’t work like this.”Doncic has also struggled at times with his free throws, converting just 72.6 percent this season despite proving so adept at getting to the line (6.4 times per game). Mom, meanwhile, admitted that Doncic was “quite sad at first” about missing out on an All-Star spot because of a format change in which fan balloting, as of last season, only accounts for 50 percent of the equation for determining starters.The good news: These all rank as welcome tests — even the Mavericks’ sub-.500 record — compared to the early hurdles posed by the transition Doncic faced at 13. That was his tender age when Doncic left his mother back in Slovenia to enter the Real Madrid academy.“There are no words to describe this, really,” Poterbin said. “Honestly I would not go through it again.”“It was way harder,” Doncic said, “than coming from Madrid to here.”"
"In a rookie season that has resembled a seismograph, Knicks forward Kevin Knox needed a performance like Sunday’s against the Los Angeles Lakers. He scored 19 points with an array of shots, slashing to the basket, hitting a step-back 3-pointer while guarded by LeBron James and finishing with finesse on a driving, left-handed layup.“Hello, Kevin Knox. It was good to see him play well,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “He’s had his bumps. We know it’s there, it’s in there. It’s just a matter of the ball going in and him getting his confidence up. But I really thought he came with a mind-set that he was going to get out of this rut. The way he was attacking, the force he was playing with.”Knox shot 8 of 14 from the field and 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the Knicks’ 124-123 victory over the Lakers, their 14th win in a dismal season.“I’d been struggling a little bit, but the whole team and coaching staff had confidence in me,” Knox said. “I came to work every single day, got up extra shots. I knew I was going to come out of the streak, so I just wanted to make sure I kept shooting.”Last year the Knicks selected Knox, a freshman from Kentucky, in the first round of the draft, ninth over all. After an ankle sprain sidelined him at the start of the season, Knox’s play took off in December, when he averaged 17.1 points and was named the Eastern Conference rookie of the month.Knox, 19, hit the rookie wall beginning in mid-January, with a 20-game stretch in which he shot 31.8 percent from the field and 27.7 from beyond the 3-point arc. The slump started soon after he scored 31 points, his highest total in the N.B.A., during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers.Shortly before that, Knox had said that he was still learning how to adjust to the demands of the long N.B.A. schedule and its 48-minute games, compared with a 40 minutes in college and A.A.U. ball.“It’s totally different,” he said in late December. “Eight minutes doesn’t seem like a lot, but it really is. That’s a whole quarter almost. Eight minutes is a long time in basketball.”To improve his fitness, Knox did extra sprints after practice and spent more time on the treadmill, running spurts of 15 minutes with the last two as fast as he could.At various points in the season, Fizdale has brought in former Knicks greats like Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier to speak to his young, struggling team. (The coach, who was a Miami Heat assistant coach when James played for them, also made a point of introducing Knox to the Lakers star after Sunday’s game.)King, who was with the Knicks for five seasons in the mid-1980s, and was known for his seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot, has focused especially on mentoring Knox.In between their meetings early in the season, Knox studied online video highlights from King’s career.“He helps my game, every time I talk to him,” Knox said. “He’s kind of like me, a wing that gets to the basket, loves transition. He kind of reminds me of myself.”Perhaps the other way around, rook.Knox said he had sought out his own tutors as well, connecting with Chris Bosh, Grant Hill, Jalen Rose, Carmelo Anthony and former Kentucky players for bits of advice during the trying moments.After Monday night’s 128-92 loss in Toronto, the Knicks had 11 games left in the season, all of them meaningless, except for their effect on the draft. The three teams with the lowest win totals will each have a 14 percent of landing the No. 1 selection in June, which presumably will be the Duke freshman Zion Williamson.The Knicks, who have the worst record in the league (14-57), are expected to lose their way into one of those slots, even after that uplifting win against the Lakers, which ended when the Knicks’ Mario Hezonja blocked a shot by James in the waning seconds.“We had a lot of ups and downs this season,” Knox said afterward. “It was big-time win, the first sweep of the season. It’s just a great way to win in the Garden, in the last 10 seconds, against one of the best players to ever play the game and we get a defensive stop with the crowd standing up yelling.”At a critical stretch in the fourth quarter, the Knicks had its three rookies on the court — Knox, center Mitchell Robinson, guard Allonzo Trier — plus guard Kadeem Allen, who was just called up from the Westchester developmental team, and forward Lance Thomas, the longest-tenured Knick.“There’s a process that needs to happen, and ours is growth, making sure the young guys are getting the experience they need in order to be good in this league,” Thomas said. “A lot of young guys don’t get to play especially extended minutes in their first year. It’s a learning experience for young guys. Our goal is to fast-track them.”Knox is sixth in the league among rookies in minutes played per game, at 28, despite shooting a subpar 36.4 percent from the field and struggling with weakside defense. He is averaging 12.3 points with 4.3 rebounds.Even so, Fizdale has never considered sending Knox to Westchester to work on his game in the anonymity of the G League “because our team was already like a glorified G League team,” Fizdale told reporters last week. Because his rookies played substantial minutes all season, he said, he thought it was better for them to take their knocks against the best.Such as James on Sunday and Toronto’s Kawhi Leonard on Monday.“Welcome to the league, kid,” Fizdale said. “This is what it’s about. This is why I wanted him in this. Take those lumps now. Later on in his career, no one will remember this stuff when he is the guy beating up on kids. This is all good for him.”"
"OAKLAND, Calif. — Lonzo Ball began to revere LeBron James when James was a first-year forward with the Cleveland Cavaliers, which would have made Ball about 6 years old at the time. But Ball, as he put it himself in an interview last week, “idolized” James so much, even then, that he had a youth-size replica of one of his jerseys.All these years later, Ball belongs to the cast of characters — otherwise known as the Los Angeles Lakers — who work alongside James and labor for victories in his mammoth shadow. It still feels a little surreal to Ball, who sits not far from James in the home locker room at Staples Center and absorbs all he can.“I’ve looked up to him my whole life,” Ball said.Ball, of course, is no stranger to the spotlight, which has followed him around — often at his father’s invitation — since he was a McDonald’s All-American at Chino Hills High School, about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. It shined on him last season, too, for better but mostly for worse, as he struggled with injuries and growing pains as a first-year point guard in the N.B.A.But the addition of James this season has brought its own brand of pressure, and it was mounting on Ball, 21, ahead of the Lakers’ annual Christmas Day game, this one a 127-101 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night.He was coming off one of his lumpiest games of the season, a 107-99 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday in which he collected all of 4 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists while shooting just 2 of 10 from the field. He missed all seven of his 3-point attempts.Lakers Coach Luke Walton thought that Ball had let his shooting woes, which are nothing particularly new, affect the rest of his game.“He’s too good of a player, and he’s too important to us, to let that happen,” Walton said.Ball, though, has been just as capable of offsetting his clunkers with solid efforts that would appear to validate the Lakers’ investment in him as the No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft.He is as tantalizing as he is maddening.He had, for example, a couple of memorable games this month, starting with the third triple-double of his career — 16 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists — in a blowout win against the Charlotte Hornets. James, who also finished that game with a triple-double (his 75th), later used his Instagram account to post  a photo of himself embracing Ball.“We’re one and the same when it comes to our playmaking ability,” James told reporters after the game.Three days later, Ball scored 23 points while shooting 9 of 16 from the field and 5 of 9 from 3-point range in a loss to the Brooklyn Nets.Taken together (and ignoring the microscopic sample size for now), those performances seemed to support the notion that he could be a worthy point guard to pair with James. Ball is an exceptional passer, the product of court vision reminiscent of a certain Lakers great who is now the team’s president of basketball operations.But Ball continues to struggle with consistency and his jump shot. Entering Tuesday’s game, he was averaging 9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists a game while shooting 39.7 percent from the field and 30.9 percent from 3-point range. (Against the Warriors, he had 6 points, 3 rebounds and 4 assists over 24 minutes.)And so, the questions trail him: Can he put it all together? And if so, can he do it quickly enough to match the accelerated timeline James’s addition has created for the Lakers?“Everybody’s watching him,” Ball said of James, “and expecting him to pretty much bring us a championship and all these great things. But he needs a supporting cast.”For his part, Ball has maintained an extraordinary level of confidence.“Obviously, I want to be an All-Star,” he said. “I want to be M.V.P. one day. But for me, it’s all about championships. When I play the game, I play to win.”And Ball, who spent one year at U.C.L.A. before turning pro, said he understands the stakes, too: “I’m from here, so I know how it is playing in L.A. If you’re winning, they love you. If not, they’ll find someone else to do the job.”Ball is wired differently. He said that criticism fuels him because he likes proving people wrong. (In the modern parlance of the game, these people might be described as “haters.”) When Rajon Rondo, the veteran point guard, started trash-talking him at practice earlier this season, Ball encouraged him to keep doing it — not that Rondo needed to be told twice.“It gets me going,” Ball said. “I grew up with my dad coaching me, yelling at me. So people talking trash — that’s how I’ve played my whole life.”Ah, yes — his father. It is worth noting that LaVar Ball has been much less of a vocal presence this season. Lonzo has a younger brother, LaMelo, who is playing high school basketball for a private academy in Ohio, and LaVar has been spending most of his time with him. He has only occasionally criticized Walton this season.“I think he’s just focused on my little brother,” Lonzo Ball said. “I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, and he can’t really take me any further with basketball. I got to the league, and that was that. I accomplished what I wanted to do, and now the rest is on me.”After undergoing knee surgery over the summer, Ball has had to work himself into playing shape through the early weeks of the season, and he might not be there yet. It is difficult to know just how much room he has for growth.“It was tough because I thought it was going to be a big summer for me,” Ball said. “I had potential my first year, but I felt like I could’ve done a lot better, and I was going to use the summer to tune everything up. But I couldn’t do anything.”Well, he could do three things: eat, watch film and lift weights. He added about 20 pounds of muscle to his upper body — he has been listed at 6 feet 6 inches and 190 pounds — which was a silver lining to an otherwise bleak off-season.“I think he really enjoyed the process of getting bigger and stronger,” the assistant coach Miles Simon said. “You could tell, because he was always walking around without a shirt on.”The added bulk has made Ball better on defense this season, Simon said, which is an underrated part of his game. But not having a full, healthy summer was a setback.“In the N.B.A., there’s a lot of stuff you can do in the off-season where you really get better,” Miles said, “and he hasn’t had that yet.”Still, the Lakers, who were 19-14 going into the Warriors game, are not necessarily in the long-term growth business, not when James is about to turn 34, in the thick of his prime, and wants to vie for championships soon-ish. Look no further than his comments last week about how much he would love to play with the likes of Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans’ All-Star center.As for Ball, James has been supportive of him, full of praise for the young guard in his interactions with the news media and on social media — and that means something, for now.“LeBron’s one of the best players ever to play the game, so I don’t think he’d lie just because I’m his teammate,” Ball said. “I think he really sees something in me.”"
"LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers described last weekend’s N.B.A. All-Star break as an opportunity for a much-needed reset, with the hope that they could ultimately make a playoff push after spending a few days apart. None of it sounded very convincing.But when the team reconvened for practice on Wednesday morning, LeBron James said his level of intensity had been “activated,” as if he were a superhero who had flipped a switch. He does not usually activate himself this early in the season, he said, but the Lakers need all of him now — in large part because they had lost so much ground when he was sidelined for about a month with a groin injury.“We would have loved to have had success when I was out, but we didn’t, so this is where we are right now,” James said.And when asked how he would elevate the play of his younger teammates, he put it simply: “We don’t have a choice.”In other words, it was sink or swim for the Lakers before their game against the Houston Rockets on Thursday night, and there would be no lifeguard.For one night, at least, the Lakers swam. They were cohesive enough to come away with a 111-106 victory against one of the better teams in the Western Conference. For one night, at least, the Lakers showed that they could erase a 19-point deficit by playing solid defense and making their free throws. For one night, at least, the Lakers could depend on players like Brandon Ingram (27 points, 13 rebounds) and Kyle Kuzma (18 points) to deliver in a game that the team really needed to win.The question now is whether the Lakers, who at 29-29 are the very definition of average, can build off it. Consistency has not been their hallmark.“It can give us some momentum that we need,” Coach Luke Walton said, “or it can do nothing. It depends how we respond to this.”Not so long ago, the Lakers had a similarly galvanizing win — or so it seemed.It was Feb. 7, and before the league’s trade deadline Magic Johnson, the team’s president of basketball operations, had failed in his quest to ship nearly half of the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for the All-Star center Anthony Davis. It was a huge soap opera, and the Lakers responded in surprising fashion: by going out that night and defeating the Boston Celtics — on the road, no less.The win, though, was fool’s gold. The Lakers got pulverized by the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, then hobbled into the All-Star break with a loss to the Atlanta Hawks — a performance so devoid of energy that it seemed to signal a dysfunctional locker room, and maybe even one that was beyond repair.The team was below .500.Walton encouraged his players to reflect and refocus over the break. For James, that meant returning to Los Angeles in playoff mode — much earlier than he would prefer.But this is unfamiliar territory for James, a three-time champion who has made 13 straight trips to the playoffs and eight straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals. Now, with an inexperienced batch of teammates on the Lakers, he is merely fighting to lead them into the postseason.“I’m all about being uncomfortable,” he said this week. “I love being uncomfortable. I fall in love with being uncomfortable, so this is another uncomfortable thing for me, and I love it.”Then he must have loved what happened against the Rockets (33-25), who built a gaping lead in the third quarter behind James Harden. But the Lakers dominated the fourth quarter by limiting the Rockets to 36.8 percent shooting and forcing six turnovers. James finished with 29 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists.“He’s had more of a serious focus on his face, about him, the last two days, even in the practice facility,” Walton said, adding: “I think he recognizes where we’re at and the sense of urgency we need to play with.”The Lakers also benefited from the fresh presence of Reggie Bullock, a versatile wing whom they acquired from the Detroit Pistons at the trade deadline. Bullock scored 14 points and defended the Rockets’ James Harden for long stretches. For a team that lacks much experience, Bullock could make a difference moving forward.“He’s a vet,” James said. “It’s great to have a shooter of his caliber, of his size; his competitive nature out on the floor. He was big for us.”The Lakers left Staples Center two and a half games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final playoff spot in the West. But James expressed supreme confidence as the team prepared to visit the Pelicans on Saturday.“I like where I’m at,” he said. “I will love where I’m at in the next few games, and I believe — continue to get better and better.”As for his teammates — well, that is up to them."
"LOS ANGELES — Rajon Rondo has had a difficult time for the Lakers. He was suspended after brawling with the Houston Rockets in the second game of the season. He proceeded to mangle his right hand not just once, but twice, requiring surgery both times while missing a total of 31 games. And in recent weeks, he has been coming off the bench for Coach Luke Walton, even as Lonzo Ball, who had been starting at point guard, continues to recover from an ankle injury.Rondo, a 13-year pro, was supposed to be an invaluable presence for the Lakers, who had otherwise surrounded LeBron James in Year 1 of the West Coast LeBron era with a cast of unproven (if promising) players and a hodgepodge of reclamation projects. Nobody thought this team would vie for a championship, but the road has been rougher than expected.In the wake of a recent two-game road trip to New Orleans and Memphis that resulted in two deflating losses and the very real sense that the Lakers could miss the playoffs, Walton approached Rondo for a quiet conversation. Walton wanted to put him back in the starting lineup for Wednesday’s game against the Pelicans, and Rondo was on board with the plan.After all, what did the Lakers have to lose? Aside from losing another game that they desperately needed to win.“We sat there and talked,” Walton said. “He’s been fine with his role. He wants to play more — everyone wants to play more. But he hasn’t been complaining or anything like that. But our conversation was one of: ‘Let’s talk about what we need to do. How do we get back on track?’ It was an honest conversation. It was healthy and positive.”As far as confidence-building exercises go, the Lakers’ subsequent 125-119 victory over the Pelicans was not necessarily Grade A material. The Pelicans have their own issues, and their star center Anthony Davis, who had hoped to be playing for the Lakers after this month’s trade deadline, was on a strict minutes limit as the Pelicans eye a summer sweepstakes for his services. (They would like to keep his limbs intact in the meantime.)But Walton’s favorite verb after the game was “need,” as in the Lakers needed the win and needed some positive vibes.Sure enough, Rondo helped a great deal, finishing with 16 assists, 11 points and 7 rebounds in 37 minutes.“I’m very confident in what Rondo has done in this league,” Walton said. “He’s struggled a little bit, but some of that’s on me. His minutes have been down. We’ve been trying to find different groups to work. But he’s proven over his career that when he gets an opportunity, he shows up to play.”Rondo was not particularly adept from the perimeter, shooting 5 of 15 from the field, and Davis feasted on the Lakers’ smaller lineup when he was on the court. Walton knows those could be more pressing issues against better teams. But for one night, the Lakers (30-31) allowed themselves to savor some hard-earned momentum — because it might not last.The Lakers, who have been hindered this season by injuries and trade-deadline intrigue, are not a great basketball team. The question is whether they are merely mediocre, with a chance of still making the playoffs, or not very good at all, in which case they will have wasted their first year with James on the roster.It hardly helps that the Lakers have one of the league’s most difficult schedules the rest of the way, starting Friday when they host the Milwaukee Bucks, who improved to 47-14 on Wednesday with a win against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers’ coming schedule also includes meetings with playoff-bound teams like the Denver Nuggets and the Toronto Raptors.“Every day is going to be its own challenge,” James said, adding: “Just try to stay positive throughout whatever’s going on.”Rondo had experienced his own set of challenges ahead of Wednesday’s game. He was coming off a pair of dreadful performances during the team’s recent two-game trip, averaging 4.5 points and 2 assists off the bench while shooting 36.4 percent from the field. He was a nonfactor, or perhaps even a net negative.“I didn’t have the rhythm on both ends of the floor,” Rondo said. “That’s why we have 82 games. You have the opportunity to play again and redeem yourself.”At Wednesday’s shootaround, center Tyson Chandler kept yelling, “energy, energy, energy,” Rondo said. And during the game itself, the players focused on their body language — lots of hugs and high-fives — in addition to actually playing some defense for a change. Walton was also pleased that the Lakers had 37 assists to go with just eight turnovers.“It’s a lot of fun when your guys are playing like that,” he said.Forget that the Pelicans are struggling. Forget that James needed to sink a fadeaway 3-pointer from the corner with 31.3 seconds left to seal the win and sidestep disaster. Forget that Julius Randle, a center the Lakers let walk in free agency last summer, torched his old team for 35 points in the loss.Forget all this until Friday, when Rondo and the rest of the Lakers are sure to face an even stiffer challenge."
"OAKLAND, Calif. — It did not seem confrontational, and he did not sound upset. But Kyle Kuzma wanted to make his feelings known.“I mean, it’s not like we’re panicking because he’s gone,” Kuzma, the second-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers, said late Tuesday night. “We’re pros, too. We’re great players — or on our way to trying to be great players. So it’s all about that next-up mentality and having a will to win.”Kuzma was speaking with reporters in the visiting locker room at Oracle Arena not long after the Lakers had demolished the Golden State Warriors, 127-101, on Christmas Day, and the “he” to whom Kuzma was referring was LeBron James, the leader of the Lakers and the most dominant player of his generation.James had strained his left groin in the third quarter, leaving his teammates to fend for themselves against the N.B.A.’s reigning champions. The training wheels were off, and the Lakers’ lesser lights seized the opportunity.[Read: Lonzo Ball Strives to Be a Point Guard Fit for a King]In his own way, Kuzma appeared to be alluding to a lesson — that it is no easy thing to labor in James’s shadow — that all of James’s teammates eventually learn. And with that lesson often comes a resolve: to show that the other members of the team have some pride and skills, and are capable of at least approximating a competitive basketball team in James’s absence.For one night, the Lakers (20-14) proved as much — and they may have more opportunities ahead, starting Thursday against Sacramento.The Lakers announced Wednesday that James would not travel with the team to play the Kings and that his status was day-to-day after a magnetic resonance imaging test confirmed that the groin had only been strained, and not more seriously damaged.Shortly before the announcement, James posted on Twitter: “Dodged a bullet! Sheesh” and “#BackInNoTime.”“It’s uncharted territory, obviously, with this group,” Lakers Coach Luke Walton said Tuesday night, before the extent of the injury was known, “but this is what we’ve been talking about, and this is what we’ve tried to play for — not that he gets hurt, but being able to play and win and compete while he’s not on the floor. That’s progress, and our team is much better now than we were to start out the season.”James played in all 82 games last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers — but he will turn 34 on Sunday.The injury news comes during a stretch in which James has attracted different, if not more, attention than usual. Last week, in response to a question, he said he would love for Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans to join him in Los Angeles. Alvin Gentry, the coach of the Pelicans, then accused James of tampering with a player under contract, but the N.B.A. determined that James had not violated league policy. Gentry later defended the Lakers star, saying he had been put in a “bad situation” when he was initially asked about Davis.In either case, James was broadcasting the idea that he was open to upgrading the talent around him — and, in fairness, who wouldn’t want to play with an all-world talent like Davis? But the math goes something like this: One or more of the current Lakers would need to go to New Orleans in a trade for Davis, which must mean that James thinks they are expendable.A few days later, James made the rare public misstep of posting offensive lyrics on his Instagram account. He subsequently apologized in an interview with ESPN — “if I offended anyone,” he said. The lyrics, by the rapper 21 Savage, include the phrase “getting that Jewish money,” and James said: “I actually thought it was a compliment, and obviously it wasn’t through the lens of a lot of people.”Amid that situation, the latest episode of James’s H.B.O. show “The Shop” aired. In it, James described N.F.L. owners as “old white men” with a “slave mentality.”By Tuesday night, though, the focus was back on LeBron James the basketball player. He was brilliant, collecting 17 points, 13 rebounds and 5 assists as he led the Lakers to a 14-point advantage over Golden State early in the third quarter. But after lunging for a loose ball, James felt some discomfort in his groin, he said, and he may have aggravated the injury when he tried to make a defensive play. He soon left for the locker room.“I’ve never seen him hurt,” Lakers guard Rajon Rondo said.The Warriors rallied, cutting the lead to 2 late in the third quarter. But then something unexpected happened: The Lakers pulled away behind players like Rondo (15 points, 10 assists), Kuzma (19 points, 6 rebounds), Brandon Ingram (14 points) and Ivica Zubac, a 21-year-old center who finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds while shooting 9 of 10 from the field.Zubac has gotten an opportunity only in recent days, because JaVale McGee, the team’s starting center, has been sidelined by an illness. Zubac had barely been playing.“It’s tough, especially mentally — it’s the worst,” Zubac said. “Everyone’s saying: ‘You’ve got to stay ready. You’ve got to stay ready.’ And you know you can play, but there are a lot of guys ahead of you in the rotation, so you have to wait until someone goes down, and that’s your only chance. And you’ve got to step up. If you don’t step up at that time, you’re not playing, like, for the next 20 games.”Zubac has channeled that sense of urgency into incredible production, averaging 17.7 points and 8.7 rebounds while shooting 78.1 percent from the field in his last three games — and perhaps the rest of the team will look to him as an example if James is out for a while.“He’s a big part of us, obviously,” Kuzma said of James. “He makes us go. But that’s why it’s a team sport.”"
"LOS ANGELES — LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has shown throughout his 16-year N.B.A. career that he is good at a lot of basketball-related activities, including scoring, passing, rebounding and winning. But perhaps one of his most remarkable assets — a feat, really — is his durability. He seldom misses games because of injury.But now, less than a week after turning 34, James is still on the mend from straining his left groin in a win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. The timetable for his return remains uncertain.The Lakers announced on Friday, before playing the visiting Knicks, that James would not make a coming trip with the team for back-to-back games against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday and the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. The Lakers’ next game after that is on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center.The team said in its statement that James was making “progress with his recovery” as he received daily treatment from the team’s medical staff and that he would be re-evaluated in one week.Entering Friday, the Lakers had lost three of the four games they had played without James, dropping them to eighth place in the Western Conference standings with a 21-17 record — a precarious position for a team with playoff hopes. The Sacramento Kings were two games back in ninth place.James’s absence has been compounded by the loss of Rajon Rondo, a veteran point guard who injured a ligament in his right ring finger against the Warriors and could miss three to four more weeks after undergoing surgery. Rondo had already missed 17 games this season because of a fractured bone in the same hand.Their absences have meant an increased reliance on the team’s young core, which includes Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. Those players have delivered at times, but not consistently enough to manufacture many wins.As for James, he had been playing some of the finest basketball of his career, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists while shooting 51.8 percent from the field and 35.6 percent from 3-point range. He appeared in each of the Lakers’ first 34 games and had not missed a game since April 12, 2017, back when he was employed by the Cleveland Cavaliers. That gave him a streak of 156 consecutive games played, including in the postseason.“I take a lot of pride in it,” James said of his sturdiness after injuring his groin. “That’s why it pissed me off not to be able to go back into the game. It’s more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That’s something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it’s not a long thing.”The Lakers initially listed James as day-to-day after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam. But Coach Luke Walton has said that the team will be cautious with James, who signed a four-year, $154 million deal in July.For much of his career, James has been able to ward off the corrosive effects of his profession — the daily wear and tear, the punishment from defenders. If nothing else, the last couple of weeks have revealed him to be at least semi-mortal, after all — and the Lakers are taking no chances, hoping they can remain afloat until he returns."
"DeMarcus Cousins is scheduled to make his long-anticipated debut with the Golden State Warriors during the team’s Los Angeles road trip later this month, according to two people with knowledge of the team’s plans.The Warriors will play the Clippers on Jan. 18 and the Lakers on Jan. 21, with Cousins expected to make his return from a torn Achilles’ tendon he sustained in January 2018 in one of those two games, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.After Golden State’s 122-95 rout of the Knicks on Tuesday night, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr would not make any promises but acknowledged that activating Cousins for either Jan. 18 or Jan. 21 is “definitely the range.”“It’s not as simple as, ‘That’s the game’ — it’s somewhere in that neighborhood,” Kerr said. “Now that we are getting closer, like I told you guys yesterday, he’s made some big strides the last week or two, conditioning-wise.”Cousins was in the midst of his best professional season with the New Orleans Pelicans last Jan. 26, when he tore his left Achilles late in a victory over the Houston Rockets.The injury cost Cousins his first career trip to the playoffs after six and a half fruitless seasons with the Sacramento Kings and also led to him signing a one-year, $5.3 million contract with the Warriors in July. The All-Star center found his options limited in free agency amid concerns about how he would recover from such a severe setback.The Warriors have been eager to see Cousins on the floor to finally address what has been one of the league’s most frequently asked questions since they signed him: How will Cousins find a niche in Golden State’s offense alongside four fellow All-Stars in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green?“He’s a great basketball player in terms of just feel and things like that,” Curry told reporters Tuesday night. “There’s going to be some fun moments out there.“I think with the collective IQ we have in our locker room and just understanding the unselfishness around what we do that we’ll be able to figure it out hopefully quickly. But it’s going to be an adjustment for sure.”Despite a well-chronicled lack of size on its roster, Golden State has been cautious in bringing Cousins back from what has historically been one of the most unforgiving injuries for basketball players. The Warriors have never had the luxury of fielding an offensive-minded center during their run of three championships over the past four years, but the position has been even more problematic this season after the third-year big man Damian Jones, having been moved into an expanded role, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. Jordan Bell, meanwhile, has struggled to establish a spot in Kerr’s rotation.“It’s exciting,” Thompson said of Cousins’s coming debut. “I know our fan base is excited, the N.B.A. is excited. I can’t wait to integrate him into our team. He adds a whole new dimension, especially on the block. He’s such a handful down there and with his ability to playmake.”When Cousins does finally make it onto the court, Golden State will become the first team since the Boston Celtics in 1975-76 to be able to put five All-Stars from the previous season on the court. The Celtics did it that season with a lineup of Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek."
"Back in November, Mitchell Robinson showed the world what he’s capable of.Robinson, the rookie Knicks center, absorbed contact under the basket from Orlando’s Melvin Frazier and flopped to the court, hoping for a foul that was never called. Instead, the Magic passed the ball around a few times, finding a wide-open Jerian Grant in the corner, 22 feet from a supine Robinson.In three seconds that defied reasonable expectation, Robinson got to his feet, raced toward the corner and leapt into the air. He fully extended his lanky 7-foot-1 frame and swatted the 3-point attempt out of midair so matter-of-factly that Grant pulled his hands toward his body, looking almost sorry that he had attempted the shot.The block was Robinson’s eighth of the game, setting a Knicks rookie record (which he stretched to nine blocks by the end of the night). But beyond the block’s impact in the moment, the play illustrated the 20-year-old’s approach to this season. The perception may be that the Knicks are tanking in hopes of drafting Duke’s Zion Williamson, but for Robinson, any shot an opponent takes is a chance for him to get a block — and he is not going to be cheated out of any of them, even if the shooter is beyond the 3-point line. As a result, a mostly irrelevant team has become must-watch television.The Knicks had not forgotten that November block when the Magic came back to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. The team posted a video of the play on Twitter, wondering if history would repeat. The post proved prophetic, as Robinson led the way in a 108-103 victory for the Knicks with 17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 blocks and 3 steals in 33 minutes off the bench. Four of the blocks came in just 40 seconds in the second quarter.“The kid is making history right now,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said of Robinson after the win. “He’s putting himself in groups with historic names. Every single day he continues to grow and get better.”The Knicks’ two-game winning streak ended on Thursday with a disappointing 125-118 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. But even in defeat, Robinson managed to add to his highlight reel, this time with a shot an opponent didn’t take. It was early in the second quarter, and Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova got the ball with a clean look at the basket from 3-point range. As he prepared to shoot, he noticed Robinson a few feet in front of him, with the rookie lowering his shoulder slightly as he prepared to leap. Dellavedova immediately thought better of trying his luck and passed the ball instead. A few seconds later on the same possession, Robinson got his block anyway, swatting away a layup attempt from Marquese Chriss.A rare prep-to-pro N.B.A. player as a result of his complicated withdrawal from Western Kentucky University, Robinson has been limited to 18.6 minutes a game as he works to refine his game, but he is still third in the N.B.A. at 2.3 blocks a game. When rated by block percentage, which estimates the percentage of an opponents’ shots a player blocks in his time on the floor, Robinson is nothing short of stunning, at 10.4 percent.Basketball Reference has tracked block percentage back to the 1973-74 season, and the top-four seasons among players with 100 or more blocks belong to Manute Bol, the 7-foot-7 shot-blocking savant. No. 5 on the list belongs to Robinson. Sample size obviously needs to be considered, but Robinson stands a chance of being the only qualified player beyond Bol and Alonzo Mourning to finish a season with a block percentage higher than 10. Rim protection luminaries such as Serge Ibaka (9.8), Mark Eaton (9.2) and Dikembe Mutombo (8.8) all fell short of that mark in their best seasons. Robinson, who has quickly become a fan favorite, believes he is just getting started. He was asked recently how many shots he could block a game if the team let him play 30 minutes a night. “Probably around six,” he said. “I feel like I can get like six.”The N.B.A. season record for blocks per game is 5.6, set by Eaton in 1984-85, yet Robinson’s boast does not seem all that far-fetched, largely because of his unusual ability to block shots along the perimeter as well as under the basket.“His potential is crazy,” Emmanuel Mudiay, the Knicks guard, told reporters before Thursday’s game. “He’s probably the best shot-blocker I ever played with in my life. In my opinion, he’s the best shot-blocker in the league.”Fizdale has said that Robinson’s confidence and execution have improved since the team acquired DeAndre Jordan to serve as his mentor. The numbers back that up, as Robinson has averaged 11 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.2 blocks a game since Jordan’s arrival on Jan. 31, while still averaging only 23.1 minutes a night. He has also continued to pester outside shooters, with eight of his 35 blocks in February coming on 3-point attempts. Fizdale was asked recently if Robinson compared to any other players he had coached. The coach, who has worked with excellent rim protectors like Marc Gasol, Jermaine O’Neal and Chris Andersen, spoke about his rookie like a proud father.“No,” he said. “He’s a different guy, and he’s got so much more room to grow. I’m going to keep my foot way up his butt to make sure he does.”That could be terrible news for anyone looking to get a shot off against the Knicks in the coming years. They might find there is no place to hide."
"Duke was given the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament Sunday night, starting Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his star freshman Zion Williamson on a path to what they hope will be the Blue Devils’ sixth national title.Duke (29-5) was one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams to receive top seeds, joining Virginia (29-3) and North Carolina (27-6). It was the second time members of the same conference were named three of the four No. 1s; the Big East did so in 2009.The fourth No. 1 seed was Gonzaga (30-3), the small stalwart from Spokane, Wash. While the Bulldogs lost the West Coast Conference title game to St. Mary’s last week, they already have a win over Duke on their résumé from a tournament in late November in Hawaii.[Region previews: East | West | South | Midwest]Of course, a top seed is no ticket to the Final Four in Minneapolis. Or even to the second round. Last year, for the first time in 136 such games, a No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 when the University of Maryland-Baltimore County stunned Virginia.The No. 2 seeds are Michigan State (28-6), Tennessee (29-5), Kentucky (27-6) and Michigan (28-6). The first of these edged the last of these in the Big Ten conference final minutes before the bracket was released. Yet it was the defeated Wolverines who received the privilege of placement in the West alongside Gonzaga, while the Spartans — who won all three games against their in-state rival this season — landed in Duke’s dreaded quadrant.The Blue Devils finished the regular season on a 3-3 skid without Williamson, who sprained his knee when his shoe ripped open during a game on Feb. 20. But Williamson, the prospective No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft, returned last week, and Duke proceeded to stomp through the A.C.C. tournament. Williamson set the Duke scoring record for that event, with 81 points.The selection committee effectively ignored the non-Williamson .500 squad and instead considered the team that has won every game except for a 2-point loss to Gonzaga and an overtime loss to Syracuse (20-13). It is Duke’s first No. 1 seed since 2015, which is also the last year it won the tournament.“They earned their right to be there,” said the selection committee chairman, Bernard Muir, who is Stanford’s athletic director, when he appeared on CBS’s selection show to discuss the bracket.The most challenging of the four regions appeared to be the South, topped by Virginia. If the Cavaliers get past 16-seeded Gardner-Webb (23-11) on Friday — a game they surely will not take for granted after last year — they could face a No. 8-seeded Mississippi (20-12) that has four wins over tournament teams. Then potential round of 16 opponents include Wisconsin (23-10), underseeded at No. 5, or fourth-seeded Kansas State (25-8), which came close to the Final Four last year.The South final could well feature No. 2-seeded Tennessee (29-5) or No. 3-seeded Purdue (23-9). Both teams are ranked in the top 10 of KenPom.com’s efficiency ratings, a list Virginia sits atop. And either might have home-court advantage at Louisville’s KFC Yum Center.The region also features two prominent conference champions: sixth-seeded Villanova (25-9), the current Big East and defending national champion, and seventh-seeded Cincinnati (28-6), which won the American Athletic Conference tournament on Sunday.In addition to Michigan State, the land mines in the East between Duke and the Final Four could include fourth-seeded Virginia Tech (24-8), which defeated the Williamson-less Blue Devils last month, and third-seeded Louisiana State (26-6), a talented squad that is without Coach Will Wade. He was suspended after a report emerged that he had discussed making an offer to a recruit on a phone call with an aspiring agent convicted of fraud in college recruiting.The East has other ties to scandal. Seventh-seeded Louisville (20-13) faces 10th-seeded Minnesota (21-13) in the first round, a game that might have been a father-son matchup between Rick and Richard Pitino had the former not been let go as Louisville’s coach in 2017 shortly after corruption allegations became public. And L.S.U.’s first game is against No. 14 Yale (21-7), the Ivy League co-champion, whose women’s soccer program was caught up in the admissions scandal that federal prosecutors revealed last week.In the national semifinals, the East winner, which will be determined in Washington, will face the West winner. In addition to Gonzaga and Michigan, contenders in that region include third-seeded Texas Tech (26-6), which was considered the best team in the strong Big 12 but was upset in the conference tournament by West Virginia (14-20); and fourth-seeded Florida State (27-7), which looked every bit Duke’s equal in the first half of the A.C.C. title game on Saturday. The West also features two mid-major darlings: No. 6 Buffalo (31-3) and No. 7 Nevada (29-4). The West Regional is in Anaheim, Calif.North Carolina and Kentucky are fish out of water in the Midwest region, particularly given its setting. In the region semifinals, the Tar Heels could meet fourth-seeded Kansas (25-9), making its record-setting 30th straight N.C.A.A. tournament appearance, while the Wildcats might face sixth-seeded Iowa State (23-11). Those games will take place at Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo. — a second home for the Jayhawks and Iowa State, who have combined to win the last seven Big 12 tournaments there.The Midwest also features fifth-seeded Auburn (25-9), the surprise Southeastern Conference winner Sunday. Tigers Coach Bruce Pearl, hired in 2014, was effectively barred from N.C.A.A. coaching for three years for recruiting violations at Tennessee. Chuck Person, a former Auburn assistant, was charged with bribery and fraud in the recruiting cases, and last Friday, prosecutors said in a court filing that Person was expected to plead guilty on Tuesday.The Big Ten led all conferences with eight teams in the tournament, while the Pacific-12 had only three. That number was actually larger than expected a week ago: Arizona State was given one of the last four at-large bids, and Oregon (23-13) surprised Washington (26-8) in the tournament final Saturday night to elbow its way into the field.The Ducks were one of several unlikely receivers of automatic spots who effectively constricted the pool of 36 at-large bids. In another example, St. Louis (23-12) won the Atlantic 10 tournament Sunday, granting the Billikens a slot alongside Virginia Commonwealth (25-7), which effectively took an at-large bid away from a bubble team by failing to win its conference tournament.This was the first year in decades that the N.C.A.A. did not use the much-maligned Rating Percentage Index, instead favoring the new N.C.A.A. Evaluation Tool. But the tournament field included 11th-seeded Arizona State (22-10) in its “last four in” despite the Sun Devils’ poor NET, while North Carolina State (22-11), a good-NET, bad-R.P.I. squad, was not even among the “first four out.”But aficionados will be pleased that Belmont (26-5) of the Ohio Valley earned an at-large bid; the Bruins will play Temple in the play-in game on Tuesday.“They made the most of the opportunities they had,” Muir said. “We just thought they were a phenomenal basketball team, very high on the offensive front — great offensive efficiency.”St. John’s (21-12) was the last team in; the Red Storm will face Arizona State in an opening game on Wednesday."
"Jimmy Butler knows what’s coming on Saturday night in Minneapolis. He understands, relishes and even encourages the looming prospect of the chilliest welcome any visiting N.B.A. player is bound to receive this season.“They’re going to boo me,” Butler said of the Minnesota fans who watched him force his way out of town via a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers in November — months after Butler led the woebegone Timberwolves to their first playoff berth in 14 seasons.“I would boo me, too. I’m not going to lie to you.”Now a key member of what is widely regarded as the most potent starting lineup on the N.B.A. map outside of Golden State, Butler will be back at Target Center for the first time since the trade turmoil that captivated the league for the first two months of the season.Butler insisted he was unfazed by what awaited him, and went on to suggest that a number of his Philadelphia colleagues, as well as some longtime friends who plan to be in attendance, will partake in the inevitable hostilities.“I might actually join in on the boos,” Butler said.Those who have spent any time around the rugged swingman surely don’t doubt it. At a time when N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver openly frets about player happiness — and when standouts such as Boston’s Kyrie Irving and Golden State’s Kevin Durant routinely rail against the approach of some of the news media — Butler is the rare star who savors the game’s edgy side and has embraced his portrayal as a villain.“I love it,” Butler said in a phone interview, repeating the phrase three times — including once with a profanity for emphasis. “Who wants to be loved all the time?“It’s O.K. It’s fine. I don’t need everybody to like me. I know who I am. I can’t say that enough. I know what I’m about. I know where my heart is. People will say, ‘He’s this way, or he’s that way,’ but nobody knows except for the people around me every day. Ask them and they’ll tell you differently.”Elton Brand, the 76ers’ general manager, certainly falls within that category, describing Butler as “a caring person” who has quickly endeared himself “not only to his teammates but to our whole business operations staff and in the community.”As a first-year general manager, Brand had his own reservations before going through with the first major move of his tenure, having watched chaos engulf the Timberwolves from afar — with no shortage of the noise coming from Butler himself after news leaked of the mid-September trade request he made in private.But when Brand did his research, consulting former coaches and executives who had worked with Butler, along with former players he knew well who had firsthand knowledge, such as Nazr Mohammed and Mike Dunleavy Jr., he received little in the way of dissenting feedback.“Even with the story that was reported, that wasn’t a big deal,” Brand said, referring to an ESPN report in January that asserted Butler “aggressively challenged” Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown. “He didn’t curse. He wasn’t loud. It was his reputation following him.”Butler, 29, admitted in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports’s Chris Haynes that he is a “confrontational” teammate, but that he is also trying to be more selective in showing his blunt nature as he gets older. It should be noted that, as Brand found, Butler has also been a largely popular teammate in his stints with the Chicago Bulls and Team U.S.A. — and, frankly, with numerous Timberwolves apart from the All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.Butler took a hit in some precincts after informing the since-fired coach with whom he’s so closely associated — Tom Thibodeau — that he was no longer interested in trying to nurture Towns and Andrew Wiggins and wanted out of Minnesota. One example of the damage: Butler is one of the top 12 players in the Eastern Conference, but East coaches snubbed him as a reserve for the All-Star Game in February.Yet Butler plays on, insisting he would “do nothing over” in Minnesota and reveling in the knowledge that for the first time in his career, he’s on a team capable of getting to the N.B.A. finals.“I will tell you that we’ve got a lot of talent,” Butler said.The Sixers haven’t established the required consistency to earn the label of East favorites, going 11-6 since the All-Star break with middling placement in both offensive (18th) and defensive (12th) efficiency in that span. Butler, though, is doing what he can to make it work, sacrificing in a manner that would seem to invalidate some of the criticism.Philadelphia followed its trade for Butler on Nov. 12 by acquiring Tobias Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 6, giving Brown two All-Star-caliber players to team with the dynamic duo of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and the shooter extraordinaire J.J. Redick. In the first 20 games since, when those five players share the floor, Butler has scaled back more than anyone, taking fewer shots (46) than the other four — with Embiid by far in the lead (95 shots).Of course, in fourth quarters, Butler has emerged as the most reliable offensive option of the quintet, shooting 12 for 18 when all five play together, highlighted by last week’s game-winning jumper against Boston after the Celtics had won six of the teams’ seven previous meetings. The natural drop in Butler’s per-game averages this season, playing for such a loaded team, tends to overshadow the fact that he still ranks 16th in the league in a category (Real Plus-Minus) strongly associated with team success.“He’s a special talent at closing and winning games — and not just offensively,” Brand said. “He’s just a winner.”An indication of Butler’s true standing in the game will come July 1, when he becomes an unrestricted free agent for the first time. Brand has said repeatedly that he hopes to keep Philadelphia’s new core four together, but Butler is expected to attract serious interest from both Los Angeles teams as well as the Nets. The Clippers’ special adviser Jerry West, to name one prominent fan, is said to be a longtime admirer of Butler’s two-way impact.Not that Butler is prepared to discuss much about the future. He brushed off free-agency talk in our conversation and claimed that he didn’t even know Minnesota was on this week’s calendar until I told him.He stuck mostly to peripheral subjects. Those include Butler’s devotion to playing dominoes and Uno, his friendship with “the best soccer player in the world” — Paris St.-Germain’s Brazilian star Neymar — and the trusty American football he travels around with. Butler said he plans to toss the football with other 76ers with greater regularity during the playoffs.“I’m telling you — it takes away some of that pressure,” Butler said.Thibodeau still lives in Minneapolis in the wake of his Jan. 6 firing, but politely declined to comment about Butler’s visit. Butler, for his part, continues to refer to Thibodeau as “my guy.” He said they maintained regular contact.Although Butler remains unwilling to dig deeply into the reasons he pushed so hard for an exit so soon after the dramatic impact he had in his lone full season with the Wolves, give him this: He is prepared to take whatever pent-up frustration has been stored up for him in the Twin Cities.Rather than ask for forgiveness from the locals, or even civility, Butler said: “I did what I did. I’m cool with it. I’m in a good place.”He has only one request for the basketball public: Pick someone else to win the East besides the up-and-down Sixers.“Don’t pick us,” Butler said. “I hope people say we’re going to lose in the first round. I don’t want anybody to think we’re that good because I think it makes us play a little bit harder.”"
"LOS ANGELES — Tobias Harris boarded a private plane in Detroit last January with Avery Bradley and Boban Marjanovic. The three players had just been traded from the Pistons to the Clippers, and now they were bound for Los Angeles — and an uncertain future.As they traveled across the country, Harris and his two teammates turned to one another to make sense of the latest change in their lives. Harris, a forward from Long Island who had already been traded three times, including once on the night he was drafted in 2011, was processing the idea of joining a new team — again.“You can’t prepare for a trade,” Harris, 26, said in an interview this week. “Like, your initial reaction is, ‘Dang, I got traded?’ But then I began to see an opportunity with this organization and in this city, and there was excitement. And I remember how we started talking about L.A.: ‘Wow, we’re really going to L.A.’”The consensus was that the Clippers were commencing a vast rebuild: After all, they had sent Blake Griffin, the cornerstone of the franchise, to the Pistons in the trade. But all these months later, it has become clear that the rebuild was more of a reinvention, and that a group of very good players — if not quite superstars — can still compete at a high level.“I know it’s a name game and all of that stuff,” said Lou Williams, a reserve guard and two-time N.B.A. Sixth Man of the Year, “but I feel that we have a pretty good basketball team.”In the wake of back-to-back overtime wins against the Milwaukee Bucks and the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors, the Clippers (8-5) are suddenly making a case as the best show in Southern California — no small feat, given that they share an arena with LeBron James and the Lakers.“We’re just fun to watch,” Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said late Monday night after his team’s 121-116 victory against the Warriors. “We really are. I mean, hell, I like watching us.”Like an unscripted reality show, the Lakers may be more compelling — the team president already barked at the coach in a private meeting, and James has been talking about patience a lot, which is never a good sign — but the Clippers are playing a more cohesive brand of basketball, at least at this early stage.That much was apparent against the Warriors, who were without the injured Stephen Curry but still brought the rest of their All-Star collective to Staples Center. Kevin Durant had 33 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for the Warriors, who erased a 14-point deficit to send the game to overtime. But the Clippers persevered in front of a fun crowd, displaying the sort of physical and mental toughness that has been their hallmark this season.“We are doing us,” said Harris, who finished with 17 points, 8 rebounds and a bruised knee, “and we’re going to keep on getting better.”The Clippers are not that far removed from the Lob City era, which featured three stars — Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan — and a series of postseason flameouts. You may have heard that it is en vogue in the N.B.A. these days to gather as much top-shelf talent as possible, and the Clippers of yore were ahead of the curve. But it never panned out.Jordan, the last remaining resident of Lob City, left last summer for the Dallas Mavericks as the Clippers embarked on a fairly nondescript off-season. They did not sign any big-time free agents, and they did not acquire any in trades. It would be naïve to suggest that this was totally by design.“Well,” Rivers said, “if we couldn’t get that, we wanted toughness. That’s all we talked about: gritty, tough, team players. That’s all we talked about in the summertime, and we felt that if we could get enough of those guys with talent, we could win some games.”A big part of that strategy for the Clippers was retaining many of the players they had from last season, when they went 42-40 and narrowly missed the playoffs. Among them was Montrezl Harrell, a rugged forward who agreed to a modest extension. The Clippers also drafted Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a point guard from Kentucky.And Harris had a set of skills he wanted to improve over the summer, starting with his ability to take defenders off the dribble. That had been a point of emphasis from Rivers, who hoped that Harris, known for much of his career as a spot-up shooter, could hone his abilities as a playmaker. But Harris worked to address other areas of his game as well: developing a more consistent 3-point shot, drawing contact so he could shoot more free throws and becoming a better defender.During a chemistry-building trip to Miami, Harris began to sense the possibilities.“This is a tough group of guys,” he said, “guys who wants to prove to themselves more than anything that they can be legit players and do things to help a team win.”Through 13 games, Harris has emerged as a steadying force and a potential All-Star, averaging 20.4 points and 8.8 rebounds while shooting 50.2 percent from the field, all career highs.Harrell and Gilgeous-Alexander have been revelations, too. Against the Warriors, Harrell scored 23 points, shooting 10 of 13 from the field, then appeared for his postgame interviews in a designer life vest. Not to be outdone, Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 18 points in 38 minutes.Rivers was asked before Monday’s game whether his players had surprised him.“I don’t think they’ve surprised me,” he said. “I think they’ve surprised other people. It’s a good group. We’re a deep basketball team. They play hard every night. They play together every night. And we’re still learning.”Rivers understands all the buzz over the Lakers — they do employ the best player in the world, after all — but his players seem more than happy to go about their own business, in their own understated way."
"Jim Boeheim, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Syracuse, struck and killed a pedestrian on Wednesday night, the police said.A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said.The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had “struck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.”A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim’s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said.The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.“I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim said in a statement. “Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.”“We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,” said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. “Coach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.”Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years.Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49."
"[Want to read more from Marc Stein? Sign up for his free, weekly N.B.A. newsletter by clicking here.]Four of the six best records in the N.B.A. belonged to Eastern Conference teams through Saturday night’s play.The Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, reached the 41-game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian (for them) 54-win pace.The first half of the regular season, in other words, has defied most preseason prognostications and requires special examination to properly sort out the 1-to-30 landscape. So it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known as the Committee (of One) and share my team-by-team progress report in the form of N.B.A. Power Rankings.The Committee, as it has since the 2002-03 season, determines the order by weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team’s big-picture outlook — with sprinkles of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in.What used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once-a-season enterprise every January now. Yet the goal, as always, is to provide a more up-to-date and detailed assessment than the standings do.(Records and statistics are current heading into Sunday’s games.)1. Toronto Raptors (32-12)The Raptors were this season’s first 30-win team, which is impressive when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have been in uniform together only three times in Toronto’s last 17 games. The threat of the Los Angeles Clippers signing Leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball-loving Canadian, but the Raptors may still assemble the best possible sales pitch: Win the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference to get to the N.B.A. finals and give Leonard ample reason to stay.2. Milwaukee Bucks (29-12)Giannis Antetokounmpo supplanting James Harden as the league’s Most Valuable Player? Mike Budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win N.B.A. Coach of the Year? Milwaukee clinching the East’s No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs? Any of those would have been fairly wild claims back in September, but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular-season schedule. The challenge now: Milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two months of its schedule.3. Golden State Warriors (28-14) Maybe the Warriors do not inspire the fear they once did. Maybe their defensive woes (having slipped to 16th in defensive efficiency) are a sign of true vulnerability. Or maybe, with DeMarcus Cousins just days away from making his long-awaited debut, Golden State’s season is about to start for real. I tend to believe it is the latter, in Year 5 of a historic run, having seen firsthand how much this team can struggle with regular-season motivation.[Read: DeMarcus Cousins Eyes Return as Warriors Prepare for 5-All-Star Lineup]4. Denver Nuggets (28-13)The regular season is just under 90 days old. The plucky Nuggets, despite numerous injuries, have held the top spot in the West — Golden State’s conference — for 44 of them. Yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guys get, as N.B.A. know-it-alls wrestle with billing Denver as a full-fledged contender — or dismissing them as a team that can only do pre-April damage. Book this either way: Nikola Jokic is a lock to snag his first All-Star berth.5. Oklahoma City (26-16)Remember the Thunder’s 0-4 start? Neither do we. Despite the season-long absence of the ace defender Andre Roberson, Oklahoma City leads the league in defensive rating (allowing just 102.9 points per 100 possessions) and specializes in the physical style that has troubled Golden State in the past. The Thunder have undoubtedly benefited from what ranks as the league’s second-easiest schedule to date, but you would struggle to find a star duo meshing better than Russell Westbrook and Paul George.6. Houston Rockets (24-17)Earlier this season, I responded to the Rockets’ disappointing start and Chris Paul’s ongoing hamstring issues by stopping just short of proclaiming the window to contention closed for James Harden and Co. Houston is 7-2 since Dec. 24 — with Harden averaging a mere 41.0 points (and 16.7 3-point attempts!) per game in that stretch. Write the Rockets off if you wish, but Harden’s brilliance, augmented by a resurgent Clint Capela and the newcomer Austin Rivers, should give you pause.7. Indiana Pacers (28-14)Surprise No. 1: Only six teams in the league, according to Basketball-Reference.com’s projections, will finish the season with at least 50 wins. Surprise No. 2: Indiana is on that list, ahead of higher-profile teams like Philadelphia and Oklahoma City, despite the fact that the All-Star guard Victor Oladipo has missed 11 games with a knee problem. Coach Nate McMillan, continuity and a top-two defense have the unfashionable Pacers overachieving — again.8. San Antonio Spurs (25-19)This season’s 11-14 start marked the first time Gregg Popovich has ever sported a sub-.500 record after 25 games and included a four-game stretch in which the Spurs unfathomably suffered three losses in excess of 30 points. The ensuing turnaround, though, has been no less remarkable. San Antonio is 14-5 and ranks No. 1 in offensive efficiency and No. 2 in defensive efficiency in that span, led by the midrange maestros DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge flat-out ignoring the league’s 3-point revolution.9. Boston Celtics (25-17)The numbers continue to say that the Celtics are fine. They have a per-game average point differential (+6.4) that ranks second only to Milwaukee’s (+9.1). Boston is also one of just four teams (along with Milwaukee, Toronto and Denver) to rank in the top 10 in both offensive (ninth) and defensive (fourth) efficiency. The problem: Boston just followed up an impressive rout of Indiana with losses in Miami and Orlando that suggested yet again that things are not fine.10. Philadelphia 76ers (27-16)For all the creative tension that has bubbled around the Sixers since they acquired Jimmy Butler on Nov. 10, they have the fourth-best overall record in that span (19-10) despite well-chronicled concerns about shooting and depth around Philadelphia’s star trio as well as the occasional squawking. Butler’s fit alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons has been less than seamless, as predicted, but stockpiling as much talent as possible and then trying to solve the puzzle is the N.B.A. way.11. Utah Jazz (23-21)The Jazz have risen to a more familiar No. 5 in defensive efficiency and contend that their road-heavy schedule, with 25 of the first 41 games away, has contributed mightily to keeping them out of the West’s top eight for much of the season. But to resemble the team most experts thought it would be, Utah needs Donovan Mitchell’s January resurgence to last, as well as a return to last season’s standards from Joe Ingles.12. Portland Trail Blazers (26-17)One of my faulty predictions from last year asserted that 2018 would be the year that the Trail Blazers finally broke up the Damian Lillard/C.J. McCollum partnership as a means to build a more balanced roster. Portland has instead clung to the hope that Jusuf Nurkic will keep inching closer to becoming the consistent third wheel it has needed for ages. It is a better team than last season’s version but only marginally — and still vulnerable to athletic opposition.13. Los Angeles Lakers (23-20)Winning without LeBron James is hard. Who knew? The Lakers are 3-6 since James suffered a strained groin in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State. As a result, they have slid from a higher-than-expected No. 4 to an uncomfortable No. 8 in the West — thus resurrecting all the preseason questions about L.A.’s ability to make the playoffs with, shall we say, such an eclectic roster. James appears likely, at 34, to miss more than the 11 games Stephen Curry lost to a similar injury in November.14. Los Angeles Clippers (24-18)I fear they are at high risk to slip out of the West’s top eight, but the Clippers would certainly slot in right at the top of the play-hard rankings if there were such an industry. The feisty likes of Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley, flanking a better-than-ever Tobias Harris, continue to make the Clippers more bizarrely competitive than anyone imagined heading into a summer in which they appear well positioned to make the loudest free-agent noise in franchise history.15. Sacramento Kings (22-21)A Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer-beater to topple the Lakers on Dec. 27 hiked the fast-paced Kings’ record to 19-16 and seemed to announce the blossoming tandem of De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield as certifiable playoff material after a league-high 12 consecutive seasons of missing out. Sacramento then unraveled, enduring a 1-5 funk which included an embarrassing fall-from-ahead loss at Phoenix when the Suns were without Devin Booker. You cannot afford funks in the West.16. Miami Heat (21-20)Little emanating from South Beach makes sense, whether it is Miami’s ability to play .500 basketball despite missing out on Butler via trade and having Goran Dragic healthy for just 14 games — or the fact this team is 0-3 against Atlanta. It is unclear how long it will take Miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of Butler’s caliber, but the retiring Dwyane Wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage.17. Brooklyn Nets (21-23)The drop-off from the East’s top five to teams trying to secure the last three playoff stops is as steep as pessimists feared. Not that the Nets intend to apologize after the barren half-decade they endured in the wake of their disastrous 2014 trade with Boston. While the Knicks tank their way to a shot at Zion Williamson, New Yorkers may get postseason games after all, thanks to success stories like Spencer Dinwiddie, D’Angelo Russell, Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen.18. New Orleans Pelicans (20-23)It is a misnomer to say Anthony Davis has no help; Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle are all accomplished players. The Pelicans’ problems have been health (most notably injuries for Mirotic and the point guard Elfrid Payton) and difficulties in playing Davis, Mirotic and Randle together even when they are all available. New Orleans, as a result, is facing the biggest possible issue: Scenarios that force them to trade The Brow grow more plausible by the day.19. Washington Wizards (18-25)Indiana has crashed the East’s upper crust to give the conference its own Fab Five, but we were not exaggerating the drop-off to the chasing pack. Look no further than the nation’s capital for proof, with the Wizards still firmly in the playoff chase despite losing John Wall to season-ending heel surgery. Recent wins over Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and Milwaukee should tell you that the Wiz are not heeding some fans’ calls to tank.20. Dallas Mavericks (20-22)Luka Doncic has a real shot to become the first rookie to achieve All-Star status since Blake Griffin in 2011, which already makes this a more successful season in Dallas than many forecast. But the huge disparity between the Mavericks’ play at home (16-4) and on the road (4-18), Dirk Nowitzki’s health woes in what they hoped would be a heartwarming final season and J.J. Barea’s season-ending Achilles tear, have combined to snuff out some of the joy.[Read: The Mavericks’ Key to Keeping Players Fresh? Blood Samples]21. Minnesota Timberwolves (21-22) As regular readers know, Glen Taylor’s passive ownership style is a frequent source of consternation for the Committee. But give Taylor this: Firing Tom Thibodeau when he did to replace him with the 32-year-old Ryan Saunders, bizarre as the timing seemed, meant eating an estimated $20 million left on Thibodeau’s contract. If only Taylor was that decisive back in June or July when the Wolves really needed to start dealing with Butler’s discontent.22. Charlotte Hornets (19-23)The Michael Jordan-owned Hornets have All-Star Weekend hosting duties in a month to assure the franchise and city a measure of prominence this season. But what they, especially Jordan, really want is a playoff berth that is by no means certain given the limited scoring punch Charlotte can field beyond its do-everything guard Kemba Walker. It also does not help that the Hornets have already racked up a league-high eight costly losses in one-possession games.23. Detroit Pistons (18-23)Since it hit my radar during an early season visit to Motown, it has been one of my favorite stats of the season: Blake Griffin leads the league in touches per game at 93.3. Nikola Jokic and Harden are the only others in 90s, but the number doubles as an illustration of the Pistons’ shortcomings as much as it spotlights Griffin’s special ability as a power player to handle the ball like a guard. He is clearly compensating for multiple holes in the roster.24. Memphis Grizzlies (19-23)Memphis has nose-dived from a West-leading record of 12-5 on Thanksgiving, losing 18 of 25 games while the former All-Star center Marc Gasol has been submerged in a slump that has shown few signs of relenting. The fade may not only cost the Grizzlies a playoff berth but also threaten to extend Mike Conley’s career-long wait for an All-Star berth, since team success is bound to be factored in to the votes of the media panel and coaches given the glut of worthy guards in the West.25. Orlando Magic (18-24)The Magic reeled off seven wins in a nine-game stretch in November under new coach Steve Clifford to spawn hopes that competing for a spot in the inviting lower reaches of the East’s playoff ladder was feasible. Two months later, apart from the career-best season assembled by the veteran big man Nikola Vucevic, Orlando is back on course for a ninth successive trip to the lottery and remains as desperate as Phoenix for an upgrade at point guard.26. Atlanta Hawks (13-29)If the Hawks finish where they are as the so-called best of the worst, they will have a 10.5 percent shot at the No. 1 overall pick in June in the N.B.A.’s new lottery system, which flattens out the odds to 14 percent each for teams with the three-worst records. In the interim, Trae Young’s development is the overwhelming focus, which makes it difficult not to partake in obsessing over how Young is shooting from the field (.394) and 3-point range (.291).27. Phoenix Suns (11-33)Deandre Ayton’s Rookie of the Year campaign would appear to be the only pleasant diversion for one of the league’s longest-suffering fan bases amid Phoenix’s ninth straight non-playoff season, Booker’s various health woes and the owner Robert Sarver’s struggles to secure public financing for the renovation of the Suns’ downtown arena. Yet I cannot say I love Ayton’s chances after witnessing up close how badly he was outplayed by the R.O.Y. favorite Doncic last week.28. New York Knicks (10-32)Will the Knicks really hold Kristaps Porzingis out for the entire season? Will the Knicks trade Enes Kanter? Will the Knicks get lucky in the June draft? Those three questions have dominated Coach David Fizdale’s first season in New York while this franchise waits for its opportunity in July to see if it can really make the long-awaited splash in free agency that many league observers legitimately expect after two mostly hapless decades.29. Chicago Bulls (10-33)Jim Boylen is still running some long practices, but things have mellowed (at least somewhat) between the Bulls and their feisty new coach after the initial wave of wind sprints, push-ups and disagreements. While Boylen works to secure a return next season, it is all about development for the rest of this season for the few keepers on the roster — most notably Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine and Wendell Carter Jr. — and finding new homes for Jabari Parker and Robin Lopez.30. Cleveland Cavaliers (8-35)In the four years between James’s two stints with his home-state franchise, Cleveland somehow won the N.B.A. draft lottery three times: 2011 (Kyrie Irving), 2013 (Anthony Bennett) and 2014 (Andrew Wiggins). Dreams of getting lucky again and earning the right to select Zion Williamson may be the only source of comfort for Cavaliers fans to get through what surely must feel like the longest of winters watching such hopeless basketball."
"Brian Bowen Jr. was one of the top high-school basketball players in the senior class of 2017. He grew up in Saginaw, Mich., an economically depressed Rust Belt city with one of the highest rates of violent crime in the nation. It is also a basketball hotbed, where players take pride in their scrappy, physical style of play. Draymond Green, an intense, sharp-elbowed All-Star with the N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors, is among the pros who have come from Saginaw.Bowen, however, was not hardened by either his city or its tough-edged basketball tradition. There is a sweetness about him, a shy smile, an engaging manner. He was given the nickname “Tugs” as an infant because he pulled on his mother’s hair with his tiny fingers, and that is what his family, friends, teammates and coaches have called him ever since. His mother chauffeured him around, fed him and made his schedule. Even after he reached high school, she could sometimes be seen kneeling or sitting at the bottom of the bleachers as she laced up his sneakers before a game, like a figure-skating mom tightening the laces of her child’s skates. In his free time, he liked to build elaborate Lego structures. The worst that was said about him, an only child, was that he could seem a little sheltered.His father, Brian Bowen Sr., a former high-school player, groomed him for basketball almost from birth. When Tugs was just 9 months old and holding onto furniture for balance as he began to walk, his father made sure he alternated between his right and left hands — while rolling a ball with the opposite hand — so he would be able to dribble and shoot a basketball with both. A few years later, the family moved into a house with a basketball court in the backyard. The court was where Tugs would begin to learn the game, and as he got older, it attracted serious players in Saginaw. They came to work, not play. Brian Bowen Sr., a former police officer who had retired on medical disability, stood watch on the sideline, offering instruction and keeping the games as clean as he could.The surface was originally concrete, but he covered it with VersaCourt, a softer synthetic material that came in sections fitted together like puzzle pieces. “He was looking ahead even back then,” his son told me last fall, the first time we talked. “If it would have stayed cement, I would have wrecked my knees, and I wouldn’t have been able to amount to anything.”His father was a good coach, and his plan for his son unfolded as he hoped. In the summer after eighth grade, Bowen was invited to the CP3 Rising Stars National Camp, associated with the N.B.A. star Chris Paul and one of the places where players make their reputations. “I was starting to blow up at that point, and I played well there, and it started to get really crazy,” he said.When he traveled beyond Saginaw, he got a sense of his growing profile. Strangers knew his name. Men he didn’t know watched from the sidelines, there to check him out specifically. “You carry yourself different after you get known, hold your head a little higher,” he said. “People are looking at you. There’s expectations for you.”Bowen cracked the starting lineup at Arthur Hill High School in Saginaw as a freshman, which no one had done for years, and then transferred to La Lumiere School in Indiana, a national powerhouse but not one of the “basketball pop-ups” that attract top prospects and provide just minimal academics. (Among La Lumiere’s graduates is John G. Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the Supreme Court.) Bowen wanted to play in the N.B.A. eventually, he said, “but I love college basketball — you know, the tournament, March Madness, all that stuff. That’s been, like, my dream since I was really little, to experience it at least just once.”It was early one evening last November when we were having this conversation. If everything had worked out as he expected, Bowen would have been in the midst of his freshman college basketball season. He would have just finished practice and been eating dinner with his teammates. Instead, he was sitting in a chair in his lawyer’s hotel room in Louisville, his long legs — he is 6-foot-7 — extended out over a dull gray carpet. He spoke in a soft voice, without much energy, as if he was still trying to process the turn his life had just taken.On Oct. 1, at a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan, the first of three scheduled trials will begin in criminal cases involving charges of bribery and other dirty dealing related to college basketball recruiting. In the first case, prosecutors claim that Bowen’s family was promised money in return for his agreeing to play for the University of Louisville, one of the most successful programs in college basketball, and by far the most profitable. Playing in a gilded arena — the KFC Yum! Center — with luxury boxes and bars in the concourses that serve bourbon and other hard liquors, Louisville basketball has generated more than $45 million in annual revenue in recent seasons.According to the government’s case, $100,000 is what it took to lure Bowen to Louisville and its Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino. Only $19,500 was actually paid to anyone — an amount equal to one-quarter of 1 percent of Pitino’s annual salary, $7.8 million. Though Pitino was fired in the wake of the investigation’s disclosure, he has not been charged with a crime. According to prosecutors, the scheme is said to have involved an executive at Adidas, the company that sponsors Louisville athletics.Brian Bowen Jr. is not a defendant; he appears to have been a bystander. But the story of his basketball courtship is a central thread in the government’s case, and the affair could well be costing him his basketball future. After Louisville said he would not be allowed to play there, he transferred to the University of South Carolina — only to be told later by the N.C.A.A. that he could not play there, either. In that organization’s view, he seems to be irredeemably tainted. At 19 years old, he was a hoops pariah.In September 2017, shortly before the college basketball season was about to start, Joon Kim, then the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, dropped a bombshell: The F.B.I. had been investigating “the criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes who participate in intercollegiate basketball.” Ten men, including assistant coaches at four prominent college basketball programs — Auburn, Arizona, Oklahoma State and the University of Southern California — were arrested. The charges essentially boiled down to the buying and selling of players. It was the biggest jolt for the sport since a nationwide wave of point-shaving nearly brought it down in the 1950s. Even though the current federal cases involve recruiting, the root cause is the same as that which has plagued college basketball from the beginning: all the dollars coursing through it — now in the billions — that bypass its unpaid work force.Kim said the defendants had “sullied the spirit of amateur athletics.” In court documents, prosecutors quoted the N.C.A.A. rule book extensively, and in doing so, called attention to stated principles that sounded antiquated, if not outright absurd. “Among the N.C.A.A.’s core principles for the conduct of intercollegiate athletics is a directive that ‘student-athletes shall be amateurs in an intercollegiate sport,’” the criminal complaint says, and that “‘student-athletes should be protected from exploitation by professional and commercial enterprises.’”It was a curious claim, given that the N.C.A.A. — the Indianapolis-based nonprofit that governs college sports — is not just an enormous commercial enterprise but arguably an exploitive one. In the fiscal year that ended in 2017, the organization surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time. A majority of its income, $761 million, came from television rights to the season-ending basketball tournament popularly known as March Madness, an annual payment that increased to $869 million in 2018. The contract with CBS and Turner Sports stretches to 2032 and has an overall value of almost $19.6 billion.That money, though, is just a fraction of what college athletes generate in football and men’s basketball. (The major college football programs essentially seceded from the N.C.A.A. when they formed the highly lucrative Bowl Championship Series in 1998, but their players still compete under the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism rubric.) Their labor is responsible for revenue that flows directly to their universities from a range of sources, including ticket sales, donations from wealthy boosters, in?stadium advertising, conference broadcast rights and so-called shoe deals in which Nike, Adidas and Under Armour pay for the right to outfit teams — thereby turning ostensibly amateur athletes into human billboards.Like all the top young players, Bowen had made his reputation in grass-roots basketball, a catchall term that encompasses Amateur Athletic Union (A.A.U.) teams, their tournaments, all-star events and the summer camps. That milieu, too, is drenched in money. Most of the grass-roots scene, including the sponsorship of the teams themselves, is underwritten by the shoe companies, and the events they sponsor have replaced high school as the primary place for college coaches to look for talent. In a report earlier this year, an N.C.A.A. commission led by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice referred to grass-roots basketball as “ungoverned space” — as if the commission were describing a third-world conflict zone under the loose control of rival warlords.N.C.A.A. rules prohibit scholastic prospects from accepting monetary benefits, but starting in middle school or even earlier, promising players are showered with gear from the shoe and apparel companies, which hope to win their loyalty so they will choose to play for the college teams they sponsor — and then wear their brand if they become pros. Go-betweens on the grass-roots circuit, referred to as street agents, find ways to get cash to the best players and their families.A veteran college assistant coach told me that “grass-roots basketball” is just the politically correct term. “It’s really a hunting ground,” he said, “a hunting ground for street agents and leeches. The money has floated down to younger and younger kids and created expectations, and we’re the bad guys either way. We’re either the cheaters who pay kids, or we’re the guys saying to families: ‘We want your kid but, no, no, the spigot just stopped. We want him for free.’”Eight defendants await trial in the recruiting cases, including four assistant coaches and several figures on the grass-roots basketball circuit, including two men affiliated with Adidas. One additional defendant pleaded guilty and is expected to testify. The charges involve bribes paid to get players to sign with Adidas-sponsored schools, as well as bribes paid to assistant coaches in return for their promises to steer current players toward specific agents and money managers when they turn pro.Most of the defendants were well known and embedded in the world of basketball recruiting. Merl Code, a former point guard for Clemson University who is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with making payoffs to high-school players, was an A.A.U. coach in South Carolina and an Adidas consultant. On one phone call secretly recorded by the F.B.I., Code talks of a payoff to a recruit and its rationale. “This is kind of one of those instances where we needed to step up and help one of our flagship schools … you know, secure a five-star-caliber kid. Obviously … that helps our potential business.” After he was charged, a post on a Clemson sports blog asked, “Is this our Merl Code?”Another defendant, Christian Dawkins, 25, is a Saginaw native whose father was a college star at Tulsa and later the high-school coach of Draymond Green. Dawkins was not much of a player himself, but after high school he quickly became an energetic hoops impresario. He dressed in bespoke suits, carried three cellphones and held court at N.B.A. drafts. He worked first for a money manager who tended the finances of pro-basketball players and then for a top N.B.A. agent. His role for each of them was to recruit players, according to prosecutors, including high-school kids with pro potential.His words, captured on the F.B.I. wiretaps and at secretly recorded gatherings, can be taken as something like a tutorial on the dark underworld of college recruiting. Some payments to high-school players or their families were concealed by routing them through the bank accounts of the nonprofit teams they played for. “If we take care of everybody and everything is done, we control everything,” the government quotes Dawkins as saying. “You can make millions off of one kid.”The government claims that Dawkins, who had known Bowen’s family for most of his life, sometimes dangled players as bargaining chips. He would seek to direct a high-school player to a particular college team, and in exchange he expected a coach at that school to persuade a current player to let Dawkins and his associates manage the player’s business affairs once he reached the N.B.A. “The kid that they want from me is Brian Bowen,” he wrote to an associate, according to an email obtained by Yahoo Sports. He added, “Arizona will do pretty much whatever we ask of them right now, until my kid decides on a school.” (Dawkins, Code and James Gatto, the Adidas executive and the company’s ambassador to the grass-roots circuit, are the three defendants scheduled for trial on Oct. 1. All have pleaded not guilty.)Bowen’s recruitment dragged on until almost the end of his senior year of high school, and he was the last of the top players in the 2017 class to commit. On June 3, he finally announced his decision on Twitter. Under his handle, @20tugs, he posted: “Happy To Announce My Commitment To The Ville!!” — that is, the University of Louisville. His father followed up with a tweet of his own. “Congrats, Tugs,” he wrote. “God has blessed you.”Louisville had not been on Bowen’s list and was rarely mentioned by any of the recruiting touts. Pitino said he was shocked. In his telling, Bowen’s decision was a gift that fell from the heavens. Bowen had visited Louisville and met with coaches for the first time just the week before he committed himself to the school. “We got lucky on this one,” Pitino said after Bowen announced his choice. “In my 40 years of coaching, this is the luckiest I’ve been.”When Bowen and his parents visited Louisville, they were accompanied by Dawkins, who sat in on their meeting with Pitino. In other conversations secretly recorded by the F.B.I., Dawkins and his associates use blunt language about bribing players to attend certain schools. “The mom is like … we need our [expletive] money,” Dawkins says in a meeting recorded at a Las Vegas hotel room, referring to a mother whose son was two years behind Bowen. “So we got to be able to fund the situation … Obviously, in turn, the kid will come back to us.”According to federal prosecutors, Dawkins brokered a deal to direct Bowen to Louisville in return for $100,000, with the money coming from Adidas. (“Adidas is committed to ethical and fair business practices,” the company said in a statement, adding that it has cooperated fully with the investigation, placed Gatto on administrative leave and “terminated any consulting relationships related to the allegations.”)The person on the receiving end of the scheme with Dawkins, prosecutors claim, was the man who installed the softer surface on the backyard court to save his son’s knees, who taught him the game — Brian Bowen Sr. Identifying Bowen Sr. as “Father-2,” one of the indictments cites a wiretap on which a defendant says that he had given $19,500, in cash, directly to “Father-2.” He has not been charged, but he is likely to be called as a witness in the October trial.Pitino, who had been in college coaching for 40 years, told me that he thought Dawkins was just a family friend of the Bowens when he came to campus and that he did not know what business he was in. He vehemently denies being involved in any arrangements to pay Bowen (or any other player) to get him to enroll at Louisville. Whatever Dawkins and others said about their influence with him was just boasting, he said; they were hustlers trading on his name.When Pitino was fired by Louisville last fall, the university cited the F.B.I. charges, as well as other episodes in his past — one of them the notorious “Strippergate” scandal, which resulted from a member of his staff paying local women to entertain high-school players whom Pitino was recruiting as well some players on his team at the time. Pitino said these parties, which took place in the basketball dorm over the course of four years, occurred without his knowledge — like the recruiting violations.Pitino was subdued when I talked to him in January. “I haven’t even thought about it,” he said, when I asked about his future plans. “There’s some mornings I don’t even feel like fighting anymore. I’ve been assassinated.” He has since published his own book and is declaring that he was not to blame — other than for possibly hiring the wrong people, or ones who did not heed his message to strictly abide by N.C.A.A. rules.Pitino has filed a lawsuit that is still pending against the University of Louisville Athletic Association, a school-related entity that was technically his employer; he claims he was wrongfully terminated. He is seeking “the full unpaid balance” of his contract, about $39 million — nearly 10 times what the public university will pay his successor (the former Xavier coach Chris Mack) this year and almost 300 times what the State of Kentucky will pay its governor.The Justice Department announced the arrests and unveiled details of its investigation of college basketball recruiting on Sept. 26, 2017. Bowen was immediately told by Louisville officials that he could not compete or practice with the team. He had been participating in workouts and playing in pickup games with his future teammates in advance of the start of full-squad practices, which were less than a week away.About two weeks later, he was summoned to New York to be interviewed by federal law-enforcement agents. His family found him a lawyer, Jason Setchen, who often represents athletes in disputes with the N.C.A.A. This, however, was more serious. Brian Bowen Jr. was being interviewed as a witness in a criminal investigation. On the way to New York, Setchen tried to buoy his spirits with some sightseeing plans: We’re taking a trip, he said, so let’s make it as fun as we can. They walked all over the city. They went to sneaker stores. To Chinatown. To ground zero and the Sept. 11 museum.The next day, Bowen was sitting in a conference room full of F.B.I. agents and prosecutors. What did he know? Did he personally take any money? Why had he delayed his choice of school for so long? What did he know about conversations between his father and Pitino? Between his dad and other Louisville coaches? How about other kids in his recruiting class? Did he have information on how they made their choices and why? It was all unfamiliar, disorienting, terrifying. Bowen told the federal agents that he had not received any money. He had not been part of any conversations about bribes to influence his decision.In early November, Setchen met with Louisville’s N.C.A.A. compliance staff and other administrators to try to persuade them to let Bowen play. The F.B.I., he said, had no further questions for his client at that time. (It has had none since.) Just before Thanksgiving, Louisville announced that Bowen would never be allowed to play for them. He found out about it when he saw the news on Twitter.This January, after completing his fall semester at Louisville, Bowen transferred to the University of South Carolina, which awarded him a basketball scholarship — suggesting that administrators there believed his account that he was not personally involved in any payoffs. As a transfer, he could not play immediately, but he imagined he would be able to join the team in September, if not sooner. In May, though, the N.C.A.A. announced that it was ruling him ineligible for the entire 2018-19 season. The organization offered no public explanation for this decision, nor did it indicate when, if ever, it might permit him to play college basketball.For all its problems, N.C.A.A. basketball remains the best route for players to advance to the N.B.A. They get first-rate coaching and the availability of round-the-clock medical, training and support staff. If a player wants to shoot 200 jump shots at 2 a.m., a student manager will go to the gym and rebound for him. At the top programs, they are more coddled than pro players.Tom Konchalski, a respected recruiting expert who has put out a newsletter for college coaches for more than four decades, saw Bowen play on the grass-roots circuit. “Did I think he was an N.B.A. player? I don’t know about immediately,” he said. “But if he had been coached for a year or two by Rick Pitino, he would have been. Few are better at developing kids, really coaching them.”There has been no indication that Brian Bowen Jr. is telling anything but the truth. He would not be the first high-school prospect whose services were exchanged for money that never found its way to him. Even if Bowen did know what was going on behind the scenes, or had some awareness of it, he was not in charge. He relied on his father and Christian Dawkins to guide his recruitment.That evening when I talked with Bowen at the hotel in Louisville, his parents were downstairs in the coffee shop. They had all walked over together. Tugs was willing to talk a little about Christian Dawkins, whom he had considered a trusted figure from back home who could help lead him through the recruiting process. He did not want to think that his father took money and said he had not brought it up with him. He had lost basketball. He did not want to lose his father. He fell back on platitudes, for comfort, I sensed — and as a way of not delving too deeply into how, at the very time his basketball career should have been ascending, he ended up in exile. “I’ve got to stay strong for my parents,” he said. (Brian Bowen Sr. would not agree to be interviewed. He has never publicly denied taking money tied to his son’s recruitment.)The last time Bowen and I talked was earlier this month, by phone. He had recently arrived in Australia to play professionally for the Sydney Kings, which he hoped could provide him with a different springboard to the N.B.A. He was living with his mother in a two-bedroom apartment in the suburb of Ryde. “I’m just trying to get adjusted,” he said. “The sleep schedule, the culture, just everything.” On the day he moved in and tried to set up his television, he somehow knocked out the electricity in his entire apartment building for four hours.He had chosen Australia over the N.B.A.’s developmental circuit, the G League, or other leagues overseas. He is making more than $100,000 for the season, significantly more than what the G League might have paid him. But his teammates, including the longtime N.B.A. player Andrew Bogut, are older — most of them are in their mid-20s to early 30s. So if he wants to earn playing time, he will have to quickly round into shape, after more than a year of not playing competitively. His team practices for about three and a half hours every morning, but he had not yet figured out how to do extra training. (He later learned he could get into the team’s practice facility with a pass he had been issued.) The Kings have athletic trainers, but he noticed that some veterans taped their own ankles at times. “I have no clue how to tape my ankles,” he said.Bowen will be eligible to enter the N.B.A. draft next spring, but he fears that he will find himself in permanent exile. He knows the league scouts players internationally, but he’s now more than 7,000 miles from the closest N.B.A. franchise — and just one of hundreds of players competing in second-tier leagues around the globe, hoping to be noticed. “I don’t want it to be that I came over here and never came back,” he said. “It was a gamble, in a sense. But the thing is, I was down to so few options.”"
"There was no Instagram post celebrating the achievement in advance this time. There was relatively little buildup from the news media. It was an event that might have dominated the news cycle in years’ past, but when LeBron James passed Michael Jordan on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list on Wednesday night, it was a triumph that somehow had been reduced to a footnote.James came into the Los Angeles Lakers’ game against the Denver Nuggets needing 13 points to surpass Jordan for fourth place on the career list. With 5 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter, he managed to force his way to the basket for a layup, giving him 14 points for the game and 32,294 for his career. For good measure, he was fouled on the play. After a short stoppage to acknowledge the moment, play resumed as the Lakers, clinging to the last shreds of their playoff hopes, tried their best to overcome a huge early deficit at home against a heavily favored opponent.The Lakers, led by an unlikely group of bench players, did make a run at Denver, reducing a 17-point deficit at halftime to 2 points with 8:37 left in the fourth quarter. But the Nuggets regained their footing and ran away with a 115-99 victory, spoiling a night in which James contributed 31 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists, looking far more energized on both ends of the court than he had in recent weeks, and finishing the night with his career point total up to 32,311. James, who has taken the brunt of the criticism for the Lakers’ failings in a difficult first year in Los Angeles, had acknowledged the pending accomplishment in a tweet shortly before the game, but was measured when discussing it with reporters earlier in the day.“I take all accomplishments as they come,” he said. “Any time I’m in the breath with any other greats — and obviously M.J. being the guy that I looked up to my whole life, the guy I admired as a kid — I think it’s going to be pretty cool.”Jordan, who owns the Charlotte Hornets, issued a brief statement on Thursday, saying, “I want to congratulate LeBron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career.” The statement was notable mostly for being far more succinct than the one he issued when Kobe Bryant passed him on the career scoring list in 2014.One would hardly have guessed from either man’s words that the greatest current basketball player had just surpassed his idol in their sport’s signature statistic. The inability for James to truly celebrate the moment was yet another indignity in a season full of them.It was a little more than a year ago when James had seemingly settled into a groove. He scored his 30,000th point — a feat he congratulated himself about on Instagram hours before he actually accomplished it. With that hurdle cleared, and with recent championship runs in Miami and Cleveland under his belt, his march toward challenging Jordan, then Bryant, then Karl Malone and maybe even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.’s career scoring leader, seemed as if it would come without the criticism that had followed him earlier in his career.A decision — a loaded word when it comes to James — to move to an ill-prepared Lakers team in the off-season has changed the calculus altogether. The team was predicted by most to struggle to make the playoffs in the West thanks to its collection of too-young players and veterans who do not complement James. Nevertheless, many have labeled the year a disappointment by virtue of the team’s struggles despite having James, a player whose presence has seemingly guaranteed a finals appearance for close to a decade.As a result, James and the people around him have not been able to take much joy in his accomplishments. Just last week he passed Andre Miller to move into 10th place in career assists, thus making him the only player currently in the top 10 in both career points and assists. That feat — it had been temporarily attained by only a handful of other players going back to the days of Bob Cousy — was met with a collective shrug.It is a reality of James’s life that he acknowledged on Wednesday.“I haven’t really appreciated anything I’ve been able to accomplish because I’m so engulfed in what’s next,” he said. “How I can continue to get better; how I can help this franchise get back to where it needs to be.”An occasional season of missing the playoffs is not unusual for most players — even the great ones — but to capture how truly rare it would be for a James-led team, consider that he has played double-digit playoff games in each of the last 13 years. He has appeared in nine N.B.A. finals — winning three — and as a result his career rankings among playoff performers come off as outrageous, even for someone as accomplished as James. Those rankings almost certainly will not improve this year. But among the more interesting aspects of James’s current predicament is the opinion among many Lakers fans that the team’s struggles have resulted in James’s failing to live up to Bryant’s legacy. Those criticisms ignore the fact that the Lakers’ current six-year run of missing the playoffs included three seasons in which Bryant was still with the team. In fact, when Bryant passed Jordan on the career scoring list in 2014 — a feat considered a big enough deal at the time that a road game in Minnesota was stopped for several minutes so the crowd could give him a standing ovation and the Timberwolves’ owner could present him with the game ball — the Lakers were only 8-16 and, partially a result of a season-ending injury to Bryant later in the year, were on their way to a 21-61 record.But in one of the endless parallels between the careers of Jordan and James, players who will be debated long after both are gone, Jordan, who passed Wilt Chamberlain for No. 3 on the career scoring list in 2003, also found little joy in what should have been a huge accomplishment, largely because his Washington Wizards were a .500 team at the time. “The thing about stats is they define you when you’re 10 or 20 years past the game,” Jordan said when asked to sum up his feelings on the accomplishment. “While you’re playing, what matters is wins.”James, who wears No. 23 because of Jordan, put a wristband on his forearm because of Jordan, learned to shoot fadeaways because of Jordan and pitches sneakers for Nike just like Jordan does, may want to heed that advice from Jordan in terms of coming back on his accomplishments later, even if they have to be put aside for now. The Lakers could never win another game and James, a player who still refuses to label himself a scorer, will always have more points than Jordan, the player who served as his inspiration on a path to greatness. “I gotta carry it on to the next kid,” James said after the game, finally letting his emotion truly show. “Hopefully I can inspire the next kid like myself.”"
"LOS ANGELES — Knicks center Enes Kanter said on Friday that he would not travel with the team to play the Washington Wizards in London on Jan. 17 because he feared retaliation for his public opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.Kanter, who is Turkish, has been an outspoken critic of the president for years.“Sadly, I’m not going because of that freaking lunatic, the Turkish president,” Kanter said after the Knicks’ 119-112 victory over the Lakers. “It’s pretty sad that all the stuff affects my career and basketball because I want to be out there and help my team win. But just because of the one lunatic guy, one maniac, one dictator, I can’t even go out there and do my job. It’s pretty sad.”Kanter said Turkish operatives could present a danger to him in London.“They have a lot of spies there,” he said. “I could get killed there easy.”An official at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, speaking Saturday on the condition of anonymity to abide by diplomatic protocol, dismissed Kanter’s comments as baseless.A Knicks official later said that Kanter would not be traveling to London because of a visa issue.In May 2017, Kanter was detained for several hours at an airport in Romania after the Turkish government canceled his travel documents. Later that year, Turkey’s state-run news agency reported that prosecutors were seeking more than four years in jail for Kanter on charges that he had insulted Erdogan on social media."
"They are proud old men with canes: Cooz and Russ, Boston basketball treasures, at 90 and 84. During the Eisenhower and Kennedy years, they shared glory as the atomic forces of the Celtics dynasty. In their dominance, they earned our appreciation even as both looked at the world, and for a time each other, through wary eyes.Bob Cousy and Bill Russell had the staying power that other N.B.A. star pairings lost. Shaq and Kobe, after three N.B.A. titles, imploded in Los Angeles. Kyrie Irving left LeBron James in Cleveland two seasons ago for his own spotlight in Boston. Now, among stars in Golden State, there are rumblings of discontent between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green.Celtics Coach Red Auerbach never had that trouble with his stars, Russell at center, Cousy at point guard. Together they won six N.B.A. championships during their seven seasons before Cousy retired. “Both have pride; both love to win and both know that it takes a team to win championships, not one man,” Auerbach said. “Men such as these need no handling. They took care of themselves.”Cousy and Russell were interlocking pieces in the Celtics’ transition game. They blended passing and shot blocking, dribbling and rebounding, offense and defense. As a passer, Cooz brought theatricality to the game; as a defender, Russ revolutionized it.Off the court, they were cordial but never truly friends. They had risen from poverty and in them stirred an outsider’s hunger, Cousy scrambling against the New York City ghetto, Russell against the white world he knew as a child in segregated Louisiana. During their time, from December 1956 until 1963 — on the civil rights timeline from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to the March on Washington — Cooz and Russ never discussed politics, civil rights or their personal lives; they settled for locker room banter.Both men were murderously competitive and self-analytical deep thinkers. Both had egos; even as they became basketball’s Ruth and Gehrig, both wanted to be Ruth. It didn’t help their relationship that the white sportswriters in Boston, a city with a fraught racial history, referred to the Celtics as “Cooz’s team.” It wasn’t … unless it was Cooz’s team and Russ’s sport. As if to prove that point, after Cousy retired, Russell led the Celtics to five more N.B.A. titles over the next six seasons. That made for 11 titles in 13 seasons (and five MVP awards for Russell), making these Celtics the most prolific American professional sports dynasty of the 20th century.Barack Obama provided the capstone to Russell’s epic life, awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011; with it, Russell had won the historical narrative of the Celtics dynasty. Now it is known as Russell’s team. Cousy knows what happened: “Reality happened,” he says.“A small thing,” Plutarch, the Greek biographer, suggested, “often makes a greater revelation of character than battles where thousands die.”And so it has been with Cooz and Russ, character revealed by two small things: a clock and a letter. Though they live 3,000 miles apart and rarely interact, Cousy and Russell have created a respect and appreciation for the other’s humanity — as poignantly defined in moments 53 years apart.When Cousy retired in April 1963, Russell wanted to give him a personal gift. He had just honored him at the Celtics’ annual Breakup Dinner, an intimate gathering for the team’s inner circle. Russell spread his hands an inch apart and said, “If Bob Cousy were this much less a man than he is, I would have resented him. There is such a thing as professional jealousy. A fellow reads about Cousy, sees his picture often, but I can honestly say I never resented Cousy.”Russell became emotional: “Cousy is outstanding. We see each other as brothers, not as great athletes. We can never find words to say what Cousy has done just by being himself. You meet a Cousy not once a month but once in a lifetime. Bob Cousy has made playing with the Celtics one of the most gratifying things in my life.” Soon after, Russell bought a handsome desk clock for Cooz, the only gift he received from teammates. Russell included an engraved inscription: “May The Next Seventy Be As Pleasant As The Last Seven. From The Russells To The Cousys.” Today that clock sits in Cousy’s dining room in Worcester, Mass.Cousy doesn’t recall Russell’s words at the dinner. Hearing them now, he wonders why he didn’t hug Russell. “Maybe that’s an indictment of my sensitivities in those days,” he says.Cousy, a widower, lives alone in the 6,300-square-foot house that he and his wife, Missie, bought in 1963. It’s filled with memories. He reads for four hours every day. Occasionally, he watches the Celtics on TV, but usually turns in at halftime.His mind remains sharp, like a basketball Library of Congress. He’s been closing circles in his life with people who matter most to him: First, Missie, who died in 2013 after nearly 63 years of marriage, and their two daughters. In 2003, Cousy sold his memorabilia for $450,000 —— trophies, plaques, scrapbooks — and gave the proceeds to the daughters.That left one more circle for Cooz to close on his End of Life To-Do List — with his greatest teammate, Russell.Cousy was viewed as one of the good guys by the N.B.A.’s early African-American players. He roomed as a rookie in 1950 with Chuck Cooper, the first black player drafted by an N.B.A. team, and they became lifelong friends. Yet he harbors regrets about his time with Russell.Racists targeted Russell in St. Louis, where at games they screamed “Baboon!” and “Black Gorilla!” In the Boston suburb of Reading, Mass., vandals once broke into Russell’s home, spray-painted racist graffiti on walls and defecated on his bed.Auerbach encouraged players to avoid controversy. Cousy remained silent. Now he regrets that. He wishes he had spoken out publicly against the racism that enveloped Russell. “I might have been able to neutralize some of this,” he said, “if I had been more outspoken.” He wishes, too, that, as Celtics captain, he had told Russell privately, “Russ, I’ve got your back.” But he did not say or do that.It is rare in America for a white man approaching 90 to reconsider race and how it played out in his life. But that’s what Cousy has done. Most great athletes embellish and burnish stories about their past. Cousy is only trying to set the record straight. This is who I was. This is his final declaration: I wish I had done more.One morning in February 2016, Cooz pulled out paper and pen and wrote a one-and-a-half-page mea culpa letter to Russ. He apologized for not having reached out to him as a teammate. He said he was sorry they hadn’t shared a more meaningful relationship in the decades since, and he accepted full responsibility for that.This was Cooz’s confessional, his last pass to Russ. He wrote his letter in answer to his conscience. They had been teammates for only seven years. But the captain knows those were not just any seven years for the Boston Celtics. He knows, too, that Russell was not just any teammate."
"No Chris Paul. No Eric Gordon. No Clint Capela. No problem. The Houston Rockets still have James Harden.In a mind-boggling performance, Harden and his supporting cast — if you can call it that — managed to beat the Memphis Grizzlies by 112-94 at Houston’s Toyota Center, with Harden scoring 57 points in 34 minutes.It was the 17th game in a row in which Harden scored at least 30 points — a feat previously accomplished in a single season by only Wilt Chamberlain — and it was Harden’s third game of 50 or more points this season. No other player has more than one.Coach Mike D’Antoni may have recorded the 600th win of his N.B.A. career in the game, but he was more interested in making sure people recognized the greatness of Harden’s feat.“What he just did, we kind of take it for granted a little bit,” D’Antoni told reporters. “It’s like, ‘Oh, look at that, isn’t that cute?’ It’s 57!” Harden, however, tried to keep the focus on Houston continuing to climb in the standings, and making up for Sunday’s loss to Orlando.“I don’t know if it was an emotional lift,” Harden told reporters of Monday’s win, “but I know it’s crunchtime in the sense that we’ve got three starters out and guys have got to pick up the slack. There’s no excuse.”While the outburst was hardly unexpected for Harden, who is now averaging an N.B.A.-leading 34.8 points a game, the Rockets’ personnel situation made it stand out. Paul has been out with an injured hamstring since Dec. 20 and Gordon has been out with an injured knee since Dec. 29. Houston’s injury report then took on what seemed like a crippling blow earlier on Monday when it was revealed that Capela, the team’s center — and the most frequent recipient of Harden’s assists — would be out for four to six weeks as a result of ligament damage in his right thumb.That list of injuries left Harden starting alongside the forgettable quartet of P.J. Tucker, Nene, Austin Rivers and Danuel House Jr. No matter, as Harden joined Kemba Walker as the only players to score more than half of their team’s points in a game this season.Harden was hot from the start, setting a Rockets record with 36 points in the first half, and he succeeded all game with his typical combination of 3-pointers (6 for 15) and free-throws (17 for 18). He also led all players in the game with nine rebounds and committed just five turnovers despite his outrageous level of usage.The last time Harden scored fewer than 30 points was Dec. 11 in Houston’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, and he just barely missed the feat that night, with 29 points on 10 of 21 shooting. Since then he has averaged 41.3 points a game over the 17 games in which the Rockets, who got off to a poor start this season, have gone 13-4.In the 17 games, Harden has topped 50 points twice and 40 points 10 times. He has also recorded five triple-doubles.While Harden’s performance on Monday broke his tie with Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the N.B.A.’s longest single-season streak of 30-plus points by a player not named Chamberlain, Harden has a long way to go before catching Wilt.Chamberlain had 30-point streaks, of 20, 25, 31 and 65 games in his career, according to Basketball-Reference.com. The longest one, which came during the 1961-62 season, is likely an unbreakable record, but it comes with an amusing footnote: In Chamberlain’s last game before the streak started, he was held to 28 points in a loss to Bill Russell’s Boston Celtics. When the streak finally ended more than three months later, Chamberlain was held to 26 points — in a loss to Russell’s Celtics.As it currently stands, though, Harden does not appear to have a foil that can be his version of Russell, so there is no telling when this streak will end."
"The Alliance of American Football is planning to suspend operations and will not play games this weekend, according to three people familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.The league isn’t officially folding, the people said Tuesday, at least not yet. An official announcement about its status was expected soon. In a statement, Bill Polian, one of the league’s founders, confirmed the decision and expressed disappointment.The Alliance is the latest in a long line of upstart professional football leagues that tried and failed to capitalize on the seemingly insatiable appetite for the sport in America. Because the N.F.L. draws an average of about 15 million viewers for each game over its five-month season, the start-up owners tend to assume that a new league with just a fraction of that audience will succeed.It hasn’t turned out that way.Since the American Football League merged with the N.F.L. in 1970, there has been the World Football League, the United States Football League, the once and future XFL, the United Football League and others. While they have had varying business models, franchise locations and opinions on the best calendar for football, none of the leagues has yet found the right formula for sustained success.Now it seems the Alliance for American Football will soon follow them to the grave.The league’s chief executive and co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, probably should have known better. He the son of Dick Ebersol, the longtime NBC Sports chairman who started the first iteration of the XFL nearly 20 years ago, alongside the professional wrestling impresario Vince McMahon. That league folded after a single season.With the help of Polian, the former general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Ebersol secured distribution deals for some of the league’s games on CBS, TNT and the NFL Network, a strong sign for a new league. The deals included little cash, however, according to two of the people.“I think there is a blind spot for most people that want to start professional sports leagues,” said Michael Huyghue, who was the commissioner of the United Football League. “The biggest issue is: What is the revenue stream? What is the revenue model?” The U.F.L. began play in 2009 and ceased operations in 2012.Most leagues require substantial television rights payments to survive, as well as a critical mass of ticket sales. Both are difficult to obtain for an unproven league. Knowing how substantial the start-up costs would be, the Alliance tried to justify its operations by comparing itself to a Silicon Valley tech company that expects to lose money for years while creating value. Ebersol believed the league’s technology and readiness for legalized gambling would make it a success.From the beginning, Ebersol had modest expectations for Year One.“There are going to be empty seats for quite some time, but we are committed to long-term investment around the idea,” he said in an interview in February, shortly before the season began.He estimated the Alliance would require $500 million to $750 million during the first five years.“You have to justify that expense, because either you are an eccentric billionaire creating a football league or raising really smart money that is patient,” Ebersol said.The Alliance’s eight teams, clustered in the Southeast and Southwest, began play after the Super Bowl. They have each played eight regular season games, with the championship game scheduled for April 27 in Frisco, Tex.But almost from the beginning, there were signs that things weren’t going well, including reports that the league had almost missed payroll.Last week the league’s controlling owner, Tom Dundon, told USA Today that the league was in danger of folding because it hadn’t secured an agreement with the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association to allow young players from N.F.L. rosters to work in the Alliance.“If the players union is not going to give us young players, we can’t be a development league,” said Dundon, who is also the owner of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes. Just two weeks into the Alliance’s game schedule, he committed up to $250 million and became the controlling owner.But to Huyghue, whose United Football League lasted almost four seasons, that was the wrong focus.“Everyone keeps thinking players, players, players,” he said. “That doesn’t solve your revenue problem.”Polian’s statement blamed Dundon for the decision to suspend the league. “When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all,” Polian said.Dundon could not be reached for comment.Despite the poor track record, the Alliance surely won’t be the last attempt to start a new professional football league. McMahon is reviving the XFL, which is to begin play next year, and last week he sold almost $272 million in World Wrestling Entertainment stock to support the venture, according to a company filing. The Pacific Pro League, founded by Don Yee, Tom Brady’s agent, is also set to start playing next year.The A.A.F.’s decision to shut down has immediate repercussions for at least one of the Alliance’s partners. Saturday afternoon’s game between Memphis and San Antonio was scheduled to be shown on CBS, serving as the lead-in to the two men’s Final Four college basketball games."
"NEVER RAN, NEVER WILL Boyhood and Football in a Changing American Inner City By Albert Samaha Illustrated. 343 pp. PublicAffairs. $28In the summers of 1973 and 1974, a former college football star turned aspiring writer named Rick Telander inhabited the basketball courts of Foster Park in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. Sometimes playing, occasionally coaching, always acutely observing, Telander produced a book, “Heaven Is a Playground” (1976), that chronicled the dazzling talent and fragile dreams of asphalt wizards like Fly Williams and Albert King. At the intersection of youthful talent and the high-stakes world of N.C.A.A. basketball, Telander portrayed the most morally complicated character of all, Rodney Parker, an unofficial agent who may or may not have been taking payoffs to deliver stellar players to certain schools.More than 40 years later, “Heaven Is a Playground” remains an iconic book of sports journalism. By my lights, it informed all the subsequent nonfiction renderings of sports in urban, black America, serving as both the inspiration and the common ancestor for such acclaimed works as “Hoop Dreams,” Steve James’s documentary about two high school basketball stars in Chicago, and “The Ticket Out,” Michael Sokolove’s book about the Crenshaw High School baseball team in South Central Los Angeles that included the future Met slugger Darryl Strawberry.Now comes Albert Samaha, a first-time author, with “Never Ran, Never Will.” Whether deliberately or by coincidence, he has set himself an especially daunting task, because his book about two seasons with a youth football team takes place in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, just down Linden Boulevard from Telander’s Flatbush, and considers in almost identical ways how sports impacts the lives of young, nonwhite, often at-risk players. Does a game like football offer lifesaving discipline, fatherly coaches and means to a scholarship? Or is it just a cruel chimera, holding out the allure of an elusive pro career? And, to add a very current concern, is the risk of a head injury at a tender age worth the potential rewards of stardom?In plumbing these profound questions, Samaha immerses himself with the Mo Better Jaguars for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. Even though the Jaguars’ three teams extend only from ages 7 to 13, existential consequences hang over their efforts. The team’s head coach, Chris Legree, who was motivated to found the Jaguars by his participation in the Million Man March, has sent four players into the N.F.L., others to college scholarships at top-rung football schools like Syracuse, and dozens to scholarships at elite private high schools like Poly Prep. But despite his ardent, paternal efforts, which Samaha captures vividly, Legree has also watched about 30 former players end up in prison. One of Legree’s best players ever was shot dead at age 19.As Legree tells one player who shows signs of choosing the street over the gridiron: “You ain’t the first guy. I’ve been around guys like you a lot of years and I know the signs. I’m always worried about you getting hooked up with the wrong people. You could get out of it and get on the right track, but you gotta be honest with me and I got to know what you want. Some guys don’t wanna be helped. The coaches, they were looking for you the other day. Because I think you got a future. You got a chance. But no one wants to deal with problems. Courts, cops, gangs, stealing, drugs.”A former college football player who now reports on criminal justice for BuzzFeed, Samaha brings empathy and scrutiny to his reporting. But his book suffers from structural problems and an inexplicable lapse in ethical judgment when it comes to identifying his characters. Sadly, these problems all could have been rectified with a firmer editing hand.The 2014 season supplies the core of the book’s drama, yet Samaha devotes the first 70-plus pages to the essentially ephemeral 2013 games. Some of his finest character portraits of coaches and parents turn up only toward the book’s end. It’s also hard to understand why Samaha uses only partial names or nicknames for all of the players — even though, in a recent essay for The Times, he was perfectly capable of fully identifying several of the Jaguars and even using their photographs.Even so, there is much to enjoy and at the best moments to admire in this book. Samaha may not finish in the top echelon of Telander disciples, the way James and Sokolove did, but “Never Ran, Never Will” proves the continued salience of urban sports as a subject for exploring larger issues of race and class."
"ARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”"
"LISBON — Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent's leagues declared they were 'united' in their determination to protect domestic football.The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would ""vigorously defend"" it against any plans to impose a new calendar. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region's biggest clubs, to ""design the club competitions of the future.""The ECA, in turn, said it wanted more teams playing more matches in continental competitions. European Leagues, which says it represents 900-plus clubs through its affiliates including ""those who are not normally playing European football"", said domestic football should remain the priority.""Our main objective is to safeguard the domestic competitions and protect the domestic competitions if needed,"" its president Lars-Christer Olsson told a news conference.""These are the most important to the fans, they are much more important than any international competitions.""Olsson added: ""These are interesting times. When it comes to real issues, I am happy to see all leagues are united.""Although UEFA has only just started discussing its plans, Olsson said it was important that the public knew what was happening. ""We have to make the views of the European Leagues known to everyone, not only stakeholders but also fans and the public so everyone knows what is going on and how we are preparing for the future club competitions,"" he said.Olsson added that the last 10 years had been negative for domestic leagues as revenue from UEFA competition had increased the gap between the richest clubs and the rest.The Premier League said that in a statement that it had ""significant concerns"" over reported plans to change the format and qualifying criteria for European tournaments.""All clubs unanimously agreed it is inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures, calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game and will work together to protect the Premier League,"" it said.""We have a fantastic combination of competitive football and committed fans that we will vigorously defend,"" it continued, adding that allegiances and local rivalries were often passed down through generations.The Premier League said it would ensure that ""European football bodies understand the importance of this, and their obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football.""

"Canadian children age 12 and younger will no longer be able to play the fullest version of tackle football starting in 2022. The restriction was devised by Football Canada, the sanctioning body for youth football in the country, as the latest in a series of steps to protect players from concussions and potential long-term cognitive problems.Randy Ambrosie, the commissioner of the Canadian Football League, which works closely with Football Canada, announced the change Wednesday in Ottawa at a parliamentary hearing on concussions and sports.“While we enthusiastically support tackle football for older age groups, we are putting a huge emphasis on flag football for young girls and boys,” Ambrosie said.Football Canada has a number of categories for the versions of tackle football children can play and when they can do so. Already, children 8 or younger are not allowed to play tackle football. Children 10 and younger are allowed to play only six-on-six tackle football, or non-contact versions of the game, like flag football.The new rule for will prohibit children 12 and under from playing 12-on-12 football, the version of the game used in Canadian colleges and in professional leagues. Children from 10 to 12 years old will still be able to play six-on-six tackle football and nine-on-nine, as well as non-contact football.Some research has shown that people who started playing tackle football before age 12 were at greater risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, compared with those who started playing tackle football after age 12.In some ways, Canada has taken more steps to protect its players than the United States has. In 2017, for instance, the Canadian Football League barred players from deliberately slamming into one another during regular-season practices, and while they still wear helmets, they no longer wear shoulder pads and other protective gear in practices.The N.F.L. has reduced, but not eliminated, full-contact practices during the season. The Ivy League is the only United States college conference to have ended full-contact football practices in the regular season.The C.F.L. also added a third bye week to its 18-game calendar so there would be more time between games for players to recover.Ambrosie, who played nine seasons in the C.F.L. and became commissioner of the league in 2017, has accelerated the introduction of safety measures partly to ward off potential lawsuits, but also to restore confidence in the sport, which has been losing players faster than in the United States.The number of children in Canada playing tackle or non-contact forms of football has plummeted since 2010, to 100,000 from 170,000, according to government surveys and research by the C.F.L.“Support for football in this country is underwhelming and disappointing,” Ambrosie told lawmakers in the House of Commons Subcommittee on Sports-Related Concussions. “At times it can feel like it’s under attack.”"
"There are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”"
"To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,"
"Quarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)"

"KUALA LUMPUR — Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa was re-elected unopposed to the position as president of the Asian Football Confederation on Saturday after the regional body's congress confirmed a new four-year term for the Bahraini by acclamation.The 53-year-old, who was not present at the meeting due to the death of his mother earlier in the week, was handed a third term at the helm after his rivals, Mohammed Al Romaithi from the United Arab Emirates and Qatari Saoud Al Mohannadi, withdrew.Sheikh Salman will extend his reign as president until at least 2023, by which time he will have completed a 10-year spell in charge of the 47-member body after initially completing the truncated term of former president Mohammed bin Hammam.He took over for the last two years of Bin Hammam's stint as AFC president after the Qatari was banned for life by governing body FIFA from all football activities for his involvement in a corruption scandal.A member of the Bahrian royal family, Sheikh Salman first came to prominence in footballing circles in 2009 when he faced off against Bin Hammam for a seat on FIFA's decision making body, a ballot he lost by a single vote.However, he won the presidential election in 2013 and was returned unopposed in 2015 before running unsuccessfully against Gianni Infantino for the position of FIFA president the following year.Initially elected on a platform of accountability, he has becoming increasingly distant during his presidency, rarely taking questions from the media since winning his second term of office.The former Bahrain Football Association president has denied accusations he was involved in human rights abuses by the Gulf state's ruling family during a crackdown on democracy protesters in 2011.The issue resurfaced in January when Sheikh Salman's position in world football was questioned by campaigners seeking the release of former Bahrain international Hakeem Al Araibi from a Thai detention centre under threat of extradition to the Gulf state.Sheikh Salman did not comment publicly on the matter and the AFC later claimed to have recused him 18 months earlier from involvement in matters involving nations in the west of the continent due to a potential conflict of interests.Those matters, though, have done little to dampen enthusiasm for him to remain in charge of Asia's governing body, with his hopes of reelection boosted in June last year when he signed off on a new deal for the AFC's commercial and broadcast rights.The agreement with Chinese-backed company DDMC Fortis will ensure revenues more than double from those under the current agreement with long-term partner Lagardere Sports.

"HOOVER, Ala. — Robin Schultz knows how important football is in this Alabama city. He was going to games long before Hoover became famous (or perhaps infamous) for its devotion to the sport, as chronicled in an MTV reality show, “Two-a-Days,” that focused on the nationally ranked Hoover High School Bucs.But when youth coaches asked about getting his grandson Jackson, 9, into football pads and the Bucs’ pipeline, Schultz could not square his grandson’s talent and love for the game with the bone-jarring hits that may cause concussions or lead to neurocognitive problems later in life.“Not happening,” he told them.Yet Schultz, like many adults, was not quite ready to give up football altogether. Instead, these parents and caregivers have let their children experience the game but avoid the bulk of its contact by playing flag football. The shift, through thriving leagues in Hoover and dozens of other cities and towns, has helped flag football become the fastest-growing team sport in the United States.Over the past three years, the number of 6-to-12-year-olds playing flag football has increased by 38 percent, to more than 1.5 million. That is nearly 100,000 more than those who currently play tackle football, according to a study by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, which has analyzed youth athletic trends for 40 years.The shift has some high-profile supporters. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, a Super Bowl champion and the most productive passer in N.F.L. history, did not put on pads for the first time until high school, and he credits flag football with laying the foundation for the skills that almost certainly will land him in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Brees now coaches his young sons’ teams in a flag football league he co-founded, Football ’N’ America, that he hopes will help keep the sport he loves relevant. “Every parent looks at football now and has reservations,” said Brees, now in his 18th N.F.L. season. “I know I do. If parents feel like the only option is tackle, then there’s a danger that a whole generation of kids may never be introduced to the game.”That is a danger the N.F.L. is taking seriously. After efforts to react to increasing public concern about injuries, ranging from teaching “safe tackling” to supporting hybrid 7-on-7 youth games, the league has been cultivating flag football as a way to stem a trend of declining participation in the tackle version of the sport, and to keep young athletes — and their families — from abandoning football entirely. The N.F.L. recently pledged to give annual grants to 400 Boys & Girls Clubs for flag football programs to reach 100,000 players ages 6 to 18. It also used its media megaphone to try to give flag football a higher profile: Over the summer, the league-owned N.F.L. Network broadcast 11 games of a new national flag football tournament.Few predict flag football will replace tackle football at the high school and college level anytime soon, but the game has taken hold in some of the sport’s most traditional strongholds. In Chicago, new leagues have siphoned scores of players from long-established tackle programs, while in Alabama, Hoover’s youth flag football league has nearly tripled in size over the past five years, to 91 teams.“Football is part of our fabric,” said Jeff Lewis, a founder of the new American Flag Football League, whose games were broadcast by the N.F.L. Network and covered on the league website last summer. The tournament, the first U.S. Open of Football, saw 128 amateur teams and four “pro” squads compete this summer. “Flag really is the version of the game that we all play on Thanksgiving morning,” Lewis said. “It’s what we play in our backyard.”Still, concern about injuries, particularly those to the brain, is part of flag football’s growing appeal. Beyond a steady stream of former high school, college and N.F.L. players being found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease known as C.T.E., several recent incidents demonstrated the dangers that younger players still face in tackle football. Last month, head injuries suffered during games resulted in the death of a high school player in Georgia and the hospitalization of a college player in Tennessee. Two weeks ago, a Mississippi player died after breaking his neck while making a tackle. A 2016 UMass Lowell Center for Public Opinion Research survey found that 78 percent of American adults did not think it was appropriate for children to participate in tackle football before age 14. Last month, the LA84 Foundation, which has given millions in grants to youth sports programs in Southern California, announced that it would no longer finance tackle football programs for children under 14. In many cases, in fact, the rush to flag football has been led by so-called “football people.”This fall, Chicago’s Academy for Urban School Leadership, a nonprofit after-school program, added flag football for fifth- and sixth-grade girls and boys to complement an existing tackle program. The new program was made possible by a $15,000 donation from the Chicago Bears, who already help pay for a tackle program for junior high school boys.“There’s people that don’t want to play soccer,” said Mike Barry, a college and N.F.L. coach for 40 years who runs the programs. “Some kids are football people. I want to give them an avenue to be at their schools so they can play.”In Wilmette, Ill., a suburb of Chicago and long a bastion of tackle football, Peter Lee, a former quarterback at Wisconsin and Yale, started a flag football team and agreed to coach it. His son Danny is a fifth grader, and Lee said that he and his wife, a nurse, could not ignore the mounting research linking those who played tackle football as children with symptoms of brain disease, like memory loss and mood swings, as they aged.“I just couldn’t rationalize it,” Lee said of letting Danny play tackle football at a young age.Demand was so strong for places in the league that Lee was able to fill a second team; among the players who signed up was Connor Drew, whose grandfather, Dave Wannstedt, is the former Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins coach. Wannstedt told his daughter Keri Drew that Connor would be better off playing flag football.“My dad didn’t really start tackle until high school, so his opinion has been to wait until even more of the science comes out,” Keri Drew said. “The unknown is what’s scary.”In Hoover, the Bucs are still the most important team in town, and the looming presence of the University of Alabama — an hour’s drive away — hovers over the city’s booming flag football league; recently, the league moved its game days to Tuesday evenings from Saturdays to avoid conflicts with Nick Saban’s top-ranked Crimson Tide.That makes for long, busy evenings for Brent Solberg, who runs the flag football program for Hoover’s parks and recreation department, which crowns champions in 11 youth divisions. Solberg recently helped organize a tournament for more than 60 teams, some from as far away as Texas and Florida.“It’s really cut into tackle football here,” Solberg said. “Our tackle league has lost about 180 to 200 kids in the last two years. I have a lot of ex-college players among my dads and coaches, and they know the wear and tear and grind that goes into playing tackle. They say this is more fun for their kids.”While flag football pitches itself as a safer alternative, some parents still steer their children away from football entirely. Jim Schwantz, a former N.F.L. player who is now the mayor of Palatine, Ill., discovered this after he started a recreational flag football league.“I found that there was a group of parents, they don’t even want to introduce their kids to flag, period, because they’ll enjoy the game and then ask to play tackle,” Schwantz said.In New Orleans on autumn Fridays, Brees coaches each of his three boys’ flag football teams in the league he co-founded. It is the night that he can share the sport that has made him wealthy and famous with the boys — Baylen, 9, Bowen, 8 and Callen, 6 — without worrying about the harm the game might do to their futures.Brees is bracing for what he acknowledges will be a difficult discussion with his wife, Brittany, and his boys if they ask to play tackle. “They are at the age where they know what Dad does,” he said.In the meantime, Brees hopes Football 'N’ America, now in its second year and with leagues in 11 cities, can delay that conversation a while longer and perhaps lead him, and other parents, to a more informed decision.“It’s every parent’s decision if, and when, they want their kids to play tackle,” Brees said. “We are armed with more information than ever before, and there is more coming every day. Flag is where I developed my love and passion for the game. Maybe some will pursue tackle. If they don’t, I hope they had a great time playing flag and appreciate the game.”"
"SAN DIEGO — The Alliance of American Football has ended its first season prematurely and told most employees that they will be terminated as of Wednesday.Employees were notified of the decision in a letter from the AAF board on Tuesday afternoon. The board essentially is majority owner Tom Dundon, who also owns the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes.The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, gave no reason for ending the inaugural season, only that the decision was made ""after careful consideration."" It also said a small staff would remain to seek new investment capital and ""restructure our business. Should those efforts prove successful, we look forward to working with many of you on season two.""The abrupt end to the latest spring league after just eight weeks stunned co-founder Bill Polian, the former NFL executive who built a Super Bowl winner with Indianapolis.""I'm extremely disappointed,"" Polian told The Associated Press by phone from Charlotte, North Carolina.""On the one hand it was kind of our wildest fantasies come true. It all came true and now it's all come crashing down.""Asked why the league was shutting down, Polian said he's heard ""only that it's about the money. That's all.""The league had teams in Orlando, Atlanta, San Diego, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, Birmingham and Memphis.Several hours before the letter was sent, Memphis quarterback Johnny Manziel tweeted : ""If you're an AAF player and the league does dissolve. The last check you got will be the last one that you get. No lawsuit or anything else will get you your bread. Save your money and keep your head up. It's the only choice at this point unless something drastic happens.""Manziel said in another tweet: ""Just the reality of this unfortunate situation.. great concept, good football on the field and fun for fans to watch. Just not enough money to go around which has been the main problem with ""other"" leagues for a long time.""The letter said employees would be paid through Wednesday.The AAF seemed to have a better chance of surviving than other alternative leagues, such as the USFL and the World League, because of the people and philosophies involved.Polian and co-founder Charlie Ebersol, a television and film producer, envisioned it as a development league for the NFL with several rules tweaks designed to speed up play and make it safer. There were no kickoffs or PATs. Teams had to go for a two-point conversion after touchdowns.""We were headed to a tremendous run of success, beginning with Saturday's game leading into the Final Four on CBS,"" Polian told the AP. ""Our league on the field has prospered and grown. The football's gotten better, and that's a tremendous tribute to the coaches and players and GMs and front office staff and all the other people who have done a phenomenal job.""Polian later said in a statement that when Dundon took over, it was his and Ebersol's belief ""that we would finish the season, pay our creditors and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all. The momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity.""While it clearly wasn't NFL-caliber football, it was entertaining and helped fill the post-Super Bowl void. Among the league's coaches were Steve Spurrier, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz and Mike Riley.However, there were signs of trouble in a league put together in less than one year.Dundon invested $250 million in the AAF shortly after play began. At the time, Ebersol said reports the Alliance was short on cash and needed a bailout from Dundon in order to make payroll were untrue. He said the league had a technical glitch in its payroll system that was fixed.The AAF aspired to be a league for players with NFL hopes, but it could not reach agreement with the NFLPA to use players at the end of NFL rosters.___AP College Football Writer Ralph D. Russo in New York contributed to this report."
"(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game. ""The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer,"" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.""I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday.""The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.

"The surfaces of this documentary are, as is customary for its director, the Romanian Corneliu Porumboiu, unprepossessing to an extreme.If you’re familiar with his work (“Police, Adjective;” “The Treasure”), you may recognize Porumboiu as one of the two men chatting in the movie’s opening scenes. These take place by a soccer field, inside a now out-of-use milling facility, and in a gray room where Porumboiu and the man doing most of the talking, Laurentiu Ginghina, stand before a white board. The lighting is minimal, the conversation at ordinary pitch and volume, and the cinematic rhythm attentive but unhurried.Ginghina speaks of injuring his leg during a soccer match many years earlier, and how after several procedures he realized he would never play the game he loved at the level to which he had aspired. His accident, he says, was the result of “imposed rules, rules that weren’t the best.” Then, using the white board, he lays out an improved version of soccer (or football, as the rest of the world knows it). In his vision, the field has no corners and the teams work in subdivisions.Following a scene in which Ginghina, at his office, offers not much help to a woman lodging a land-use complaint (the movie withholds the details of his bureaucratic job), he takes up the sports discussion again with Porumboiu at a gym, where a group of men rehearse some of Ginghina’s ideas, then at an apartment Ginghina shares with his father. There, Ginghina is compelled to wrestle with the viability of his ideas.Porumboiu (who in 2014 made the documentary “The Second Game,” about a soccer match refereed by his father) implies that Ginghina’s proposals would make the game something other than soccer. “Football 2.0,” Ginghina says. He reels off more versions in sequence, and Porumboiu interjects, “infinite football.”Robert Coover’s 1968 novel “The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.” depicted the world of a man who conducted an imaginary professional baseball season entirely through rolls of dice. Its thematic argument was that the only life is the life of the mind. “Infinite Football” has similar concerns but somewhat more of a metaphysical bent.While the movie has allegorical resonances with the political and human rights disasters of 20th-century Romania, by the end, its surfaces, while remaining superficially unimpressive, open up as the film moves from epistemological speculation onto a plane of mysticism. This relatively short film contains worlds."
"LONDON — England soccer captain Harry Kane received the MBE award on Thursday for services to football after leading the national team to the World Cup semi-final in Russia last Summer.Prince William, the president of the English Football Association, presented the 25-year-old Tottenham striker with his medal at Buckingham Palace after Kane was included in Queen Elizabeth's 2019 New Year's honours list. He was top scorer with six goals in Russia but the team was knocked out after a 2-1 loss to Croatia in the semi-finals.Kane attended the ceremony with his fiancee and his parents. ""A real honour and an enormously proud day for me and my family,"" he tweeted. ""A massive thanks to my England teammates and coaching staff.""

"COATESVILLE, Pa. — In a weekly good-luck ritual, Ricky Ortega, the all-state quarterback at Coatesville Area High School, handed his gold necklace to his coach and father, Matt Ortega, who wore the family heirloom during the Red Raiders’ latest playoff victory.During the 38-19 win last Friday, Ricky, a junior, threw his 100th career touchdown pass, while Matt also reached a triple-digit milestone at the school. Afterward, Ricky hugged his father and players doused the coach with a bucket of water in the rainy cold. The team received T-shirts  that depicted Matt Ortega’s face and proclaimed: “100 wins. Can’t touch this.”If Coatesville (12-0) wins four more games through early December, the Ortegas will become a rare father-son duo and, by all accounts, the first of Latin American descent, to win a Pennsylvania state championship together in football, a sport in which Latinos have been historically underrepresented at all levels nationwide.Yet as demographics have shifted over the past three decades, more Latino surnames have begun appearing on high school rosters, said Jorge Iber, a history professor at Texas Tech University and an author of the coming book, “Latinos in American Football.” The names, Iber said, have begun turning up in places like Garden City, Kan.; Springdale, Ark.; and Dalton, Ga. — beyond the traditional football hotbeds with significant Latino populations, in Texas, California and Florida.“Some of these folks are beginning to move into football and gain a certain amount of acceptance,” Iber said. “Before, the names were Smith and Jones and Johnson. Now, increasingly, they are Rodriguez, Gutierrez and Sanchez.”The same type of shift has occurred in Coatesville, a struggling steel town outside Philadelphia where the population of 13,000 is roughly 50 percent black, 25 percent white and 25 percent Latino.  The Ortegas are second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans, and the Red Raiders have seven Latino players among the 64 on the varsity roster and eight among the 43 on the freshman team.If Coatesville reaches the championship game in Class 6A, the division for Pennsylvania’s largest high schools, the Red Raiders are expected to face the state’s top-ranked team, St. Joseph’s Preparatory School of Philadelphia. Its coach, Gabe Infante, is the son of Cuban immigrants. He has won three state titles at the school — which defeated Coatesville, 53-49, in the 2017 semifinals — but has no sons.The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association said it does not keep records of the ethnicity of coaches and players. Neither does the National Federation of State High School Associations. But a Coatesville-St. Joe’s Prep matchup “would probably be the first all-Latino state championship ever in Pennsylvania,” Infante, 45, said of himself and Matt Ortega.Football faces a decline in youth participation, largely over concerns about long-term brain damage. But in a place like Coatesville, it thrives, while also providing a counterpoint to the belief, expressed by some in this divided country, that Latino immigrants and their descendants resist blending into longstanding American culture.Few things portray assimilation more vividly than the Coatesville football team and the Ortega family’s devotion to the sport. The Red Raiders’ wide-open offense features plays with names like Houston French Fry and Chicken Mary Nebraska. When Ricky Ortega and his two brothers were born, their parents brought them home from the hospital in Penn State onesies, such fans are they of the Nittany Lions team.Matt’s grandfather Tomas Ortega left a subsistence existence in Mexico as a 13-year-old in the 1920s, hopping a train to Texas, working in quarries around Chicago and traveling to Pennsylvania to work for Bethlehem Steel.The youngest of his nine children, Rick Ortega — Matt’s father and Ricky’s grandfather — played high school football outside Harrisburg, the state capital, in the mid-1960s, when few Hispanics participated in the sport.When Matt Ortega, now 44, found scrapbooks detailing his father’s successes as an all-area player, he told himself, “I want to be like my dad.” Eventually, Matt played quarterback and safety at St. Francis University in Pennsylvania. Today, Rick Ortega, 69, a retired carpenter, watches Coatesville’s games along the sideline.“He always said he wanted to live the American dream and get what this country can offer you,” said Matt Ortega, who teaches middle school science in addition to coaching.But gains in participation by Latinos in American football have come incrementally. Ron Rivera of the Carolina Panthers is the only Latino head coach among the N.F.L.’s 32 teams. And there are only two Latino head coaches among the 130 universities in the top tier of college football — Mario Cristobal of Oregon and Tony Sanchez of Nevada-Las Vegas — according to the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida.As the 2018 N.F.L. season opened, only 18 of the league’s 1,696 players were Hispanic. N.C.A.A. statistics for the 2017-18 school year listed 471 Latino players among 15,606 in the upper level of college football.A 2018 study by a prominent Texas football magazine, Dave Campbell’s Texas Football, found only 28 Hispanic head coaches among the state’s 253 largest high schools, even though 50.6 percent of the students in those schools were Hispanic.This underrepresentation is due to several factors over the decades, Iber, the Texas Tech professor, said. Many Latino children had to work to help support their families. Some immigrants were less familiar with football than with sports like soccer. And historical discrimination often dismissed the capabilities of Latinos in football.Months after leading Coatesville High to the state title game in 2012, Matt Ortega felt the sting of racism in a widely publicized scandal. Text messages exchanged by the school district’s superintendent and athletic director referred to him as a “taco” and a “burro.” Both resigned.“I was shocked, but I wasn’t. I had dealt with it before,” Ortega said. “It was always motivation for me.”Coatesville is a pocket of distress amid the prosperity of Chester County, Pennsylvania’s most affluent in terms of per capita income. A number of downtown storefronts are empty. The steel mill that once had 5,500 workers now employs about 600. More than 30 percent of residents live in poverty, according to census figures. The area has drawn people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Central and South America to work in the mushroom industry, on horse farms and in landscaping, carpentry, cleaning and service businesses.There is a proud sense of community here, Matt Ortega said, and an embrace of diversity.That’s why he came here from nearby York a decade ago to coach, teach and raise his family. It is also why Anthony Young, 55, a former standout safety at Temple University who played briefly in the N.F.L., moved here from Philadelphia with his three sons. His youngest, Aaron, is Coatesville’s star running back and plans to play next season at Michigan State.“It’s a struggling steel town, but they live and breathe for their sports,” said Anthony Young, who coaches the Coatesville defensive secondary. “It’s our opportunity to give them something to cheer about.”A sign in the dressing room exhorts the Red Raiders to play for family and community. Before games, the players engage in a call and response, with one asking, “Who got my back?” and the others replying in unison, “I got your back!”“We welcome everyone,” said Chris McBride, 17, Coatesville’s right tackle, who is black. When the players are dressed in the same helmets and jerseys, he said, “we’re all the same. Skin color doesn’t matter at all.”Rikelvin Santiago, 18, the Red Raiders’ 6-foot-5, 340-pound left tackle, was born in Puerto Rico. His family moved to Chester County when he was 3. Sports, he said, made him feel more confident and helped him make friends. A number of small Division I colleges have shown interest in offering him a football scholarship. Army has shown interest in him as well.Winning a state championship “would show that Hispanics can be successful and go to college, which is the best way to help your family,” Santiago said.Frankie de los Santos, 18, a senior linebacker, was born in Queens of Ecuadorean and Dominican heritage. He lived for a time in Florida and tried baseball but found it boring, his mother, Diana, said.“He didn’t like standing around waiting for the ball,” she said. “He liked the adrenaline of football.”After playing as a freshman and sophomore, de los Santos joined the soccer team with his cousins in his junior year. But he missed football, watching games along the fence surrounding the field. He returned to the team this season.“A lot of Hispanics want to be part of the community,” he said. “In soccer, you only have a couple of benches for fans. In football, you have all these bleachers of fans supporting you.”"
"Jalen Hurts has gone from winning a national championship at Alabama to following in the footsteps of back-to-back Heisman winners Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray at Oklahoma.His message as he met the media Wednesday for the first time since his transfer: He's ready for all the pressure and expectations.""I think this whole situation is unique. Everything about it is unique,"" Hurts said at a news conference in Norman, Okla., that lasted slightly longer than 30 minutes. ""For me, I know it's happening to a unique person. I'm not your average Joe. I'm kind of built for these type of situations.""Hurts threw for 5,626 yards with 48 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in three seasons at Alabama, adding 1,976 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns.

George was in Florida during the school's spring break.--Purdue will add a gate outside the entrance to the student section at Ross-Ade Stadium to honor Tyler Trent, a student described as a ""superfan"" who passed away on Jan. 1.Accompanied by Trent's parents, Purdue president Mitch Daniels said in a campus ceremony that the gate will be built before the 2019 football season opens. It will have Purdue-gold lettering and bear the logo ""T2."" A plaque with his image and the words ""Forever Our Captain"" will be hung on the gate.The entrance is where an ill Trent camped out with a friend for tickets to the 2017 game against Michigan and first met Purdue coach Jeff Brohm. Trent, 20, died of osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. His fight against the disease inspired the Boilermakers football team and countless others.--Field Level Media"
"Less than a month after the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislature’s Joint Committee on Public Health this week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.The bipartisan bill, known as No Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.“There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development,” one of the bill’s sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure and public opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.“Should we ban youth soccer too?” asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. “Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldn’t be?”A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, which governs youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are “best left to parents.” To that end, she said, it has created a set of guidelines developed by leaders in athlete development and football.The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. “Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids,” he said.Studies by Boston University and other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer who teaches a legal course on traumatic brain injury and tracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth league’s promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies’ offering low-nicotine cigarettes.“People don’t understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks,” he said. “It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.”Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of the Massachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.“Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground,” he said, “it seems like an overstep of authority.”Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coaches youth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.“I understand the concern,” he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the “knuckle-dragging days” when “you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking” during practice.He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introduced shoulder-tackling techniques developed by U.S.A. Football.Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots’ head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not “a political guy.”“But,” he said, “I’ll definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.”In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, which increasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association adopted new guidelines intended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues were quashed by grass-roots movements led by parents and coaches.When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jersey proposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.That bill is currently in limbo.“Unfortunately, the old boys’ club of politics and football go hand in hand,” said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. “This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.”A similar bill in New York failed, and California’s Safe Football Act was pulled before a committee vote. The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,  did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Maryland’s proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer, was killed in committee.These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.“I really did not expect it to pass,” said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Maryland’s bill.“But I think it’s a conversation we have to have,” she said, “and I don’t think the conversation is over.”Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.“Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem,” he said. “If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.”"
"LONDON — High street chemist chain Boots UK has become a sponsor of the England women's national soccer team as well as Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland for the next three years, the English FA said on Tuesday.Boots' deal covers this year's World Cup in France and runs until the 2021 European Championship in England.""We are delighted to be partnering with Boots as the official partner of the England women’s team in what is a hugely exciting time for women's football,” said Mark Bullingham, FA chief executive and current chief commercial and football development officer.""It's important we partner with brands that share our passion for raising the profile of the sport and the ability to help us do so.""

"PHOENIX — Roger Goodell got it right.NFL fans rarely feel that way. Right now, they should.Many times, perhaps most of the time, the NFL commissioner is doing the bidding of the owners. That's led to plenty of criticism of Goodell when it's the guys who run the 32 franchises who deserve more bad reviews than he does.When it comes to league probes, the NFL so often has fallen short — Ray Rice, Kareem Hunt, Saints bounties — that Goodell takes the arrows rather than the investigators who should be blamed.And yes, there are instances, particularly when it comes to handing out discipline, in which Goodell is the correct target.So when the guy uses his power for the good of the game, for the players, the coaches and, indeed, the fans, then praise is due.Two months after one of the most embarrassing moments of his regime — or that of any other commissioner — Goodell pretty much made sure a deeply necessary change to the rules was passed.Don't underestimate the significance of the addition of pass interference, whether flagged or not, to the video review officiating system. Such calls and non-calls now can be challenged by coaches and reviewed by officials. It was passed for one season, by the astounding margin of 31-1. It almost certainly is here to stay, and Goodell is a major reason.""I told the owners we need to get to a place, and I felt strongly we should have OPI and DPI and that we should be able to throw flags (that were not thrown on the field),"" Goodell said Tuesday. ""Everyone in there finally got to understand through a long process and a lot of discussion, everyone wanted to get it right. Some had to remove themselves from long-shared views.""A short-shared view among fans, especially those in the Big Easy, has been that an egregious missed call in the NFC championship game cost the New Orleans Saints a trip to the Super Bowl. Their case was strengthened by this decision.Yet, in a way, this is a more important victory for the Who Dats and for all pro football fans. The sport has become so fast, so complex and so wide open that the officials struggle to keep up.Even worse, technology is so advanced that the errors made in real time become exacerbated when examined in the close-up, super-slow motion shots available to viewers.The NFL needed a leap forward like this. Indeed, it's more like a long Drew Brees to Michael Thomas touchdown pass than an Alvin Kamara run for a first down. Both plays move the ball, but the TD throw can be an instant game changer.Credit Goodell for laying down the law to get the video review rules enhanced. Also credit Saints coach Sean Payton, who helped lead the charge to progress not only because he was the victimized guy with the head set on the sideline for the blown call, but for catalyzing the movement.""There were just a lot of great healthy discussions about our game,"" said Payton, along with Pittsburgh's Mike Tomlin the only coaches on the powerful competition committee that recommends rule adjustments. ""When you are on this committee there is a little bit of a responsibility just to the game and football fans in general.""Anytime, I think, if we have gone through a process like this and with an open heart tried to look at doing what is right, and after much discussion came to a conclusion where ownership, league office, coaches, general managers felt real good about, certainly fans won, knowing that, man, those guys are working hard at the right decision.""___"
"WELLINGTON — New Zealand Football continued overhauling its governance after a tumultuous 2018 by electing Johanna Wood as its first female president at their annual congress in Auckland on Tuesday.Wood, who was elected to NZF's executive committee last year for a four-year term, replaces acting president Phil Barry, who resigned last week.Barry himself replaced Deryck Shaw, who resigned in October after an independent review found the executive committee had adopted a 'hands off approach' to governance following complaints by the women's national team about their coach.""We have gone through and are continuing to go through a period of transition,"" Wood said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Both ExCo and the senior management team... are committed to delivering on the recommendations of the independent review.""Wood was serving as an acting vice president until Tuesday's election and was last month elected as the Oceania confederation's member to the FIFA Council, which sets the world governing body's strategic direction.NZF was engulfed in controversy last year with the Football Ferns' women's team complaining about the environment created by coach Andreas Heraf, who eventually resigned. He was also NZF's national technical director.Chief executive Andy Martin also left the organisation and was yet to be replaced. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"
"LONDON — England defender Danny Rose has had enough of racism in the game and said he cannot wait to get out of football amid frustration over the response of the authorities to the abuse.Tottenham Hotspur full back Rose was among the players who were victims of offensive chanting when they played for England in Montenegro last month in a Euro 2020 qualifier.“I’ve had enough,” Rose, 28, was quoted as saying by The Guardian on Thursday. “At the minute, how I programme myself is that I just think: ‘I’ve got five or six more years left in football and I just can’t wait to see the back of it’.“Seeing how things are done in the game at the minute, I just want to get out of it.""Rose feels not enough action is being taken and the disparity in the punishment highlights its ineffectiveness.“Obviously, it is a bit sad (to feel like this) but when countries only get fined what I’d probably spend on a night out in London, what do you expect?” he added.“You see my manager get banned for two games for just being confrontational against Mike Dean,” he said of Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino’s two-match touchline ban for confronting the referee at the end of a 2-1 defeat at Burnley in February.“But yet a country can only get fined a little bit of money for being racist. It’s just a bit of a farce at the minute. So that’s where we are at in football and until there’s a harsh punishment, there’s not much else we can expect.""Rose said he had expected the racist abuse dished out to him and his England team mates Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi during the match against Montenegro in Podgorica.“I played in Serbia about eight years ago and it happened there. So I sort of thought it would be a possibility that it might happen again and it did. “I looked up straight away in the first half and I know the exact time it happened in the first half.“But it didn’t affect my game. I’m a big boy now and I know that three points are obviously not the most important thing when you’re going through something like that, but I just wanted the team to get three points so that we could move on and get out of Montenegro as quickly as possible,” Rose said.England are top of 2020 European Championship qualifying Group A with a maximum six points after their 5-1 win in Montenegro and a 5-0 home victory over the Czech Republic.

"Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.“I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy,” said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the school’s Alzheimer’s Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is “good evidence” to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football — and not just those involving concussions — and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.“I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head,” Mez said. “But given the country’s interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.”Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularly  in New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states — Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma — lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.“We’re not doing this as a recruiting ploy,” he said. “It’s just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they won’t have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.”Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coaches seminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.Terry O’Neil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, “is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.”"
"The football team at my alma mater, Northwestern, is having a pretty good season. Once, that would have thrilled me. Now, it just makes me uneasy.The first game I attended at N.U. was a doozy: The Wildcats beat Northern Illinois on Sept. 25, 1982, to break what remains the longest losing streak (34 games) in Division I-A history. My classmates streamed onto the field at Dyche Stadium to dismantle the goal posts in triumph and deposit them in Lake Michigan. The team went on to a losing season, though: It had been a long time since the days when the future Notre Dame legend Ara Parseghian was its relatively successful coach, and even longer since Northwestern had gone to the Rose Bowl.We would have been delighted if the team had won more games (it didn’t have a winning season until 1995), but we consoled ourselves by taking a sort of perverse pride in our losses. As the Wildcats were being pounded by Big Ten opponents — especially our downstate rival, the University of Illinois — the N.U. students in the stands would chant, “That’s all right, that’s O.K., you’re going to work for us one day!” Obnoxious and classist, yes, but satisfying.When I worked for the sports section of the campus newspaper, we’d dutifully write features about the hopes and dreams of the football players at the beginning of the season. Then, as the season rolled on, we would just as dutifully record their losses next to accounts of the exploits of the university’s real star athletes: the field hockey team.And that was all right, that was O.K., because nobody went to Northwestern for its football prowess. I don’t recall ever meeting a fellow student who regretted taking a pass on Ohio State because the football there was better. If only a few of our players got jobs in the N.F.L., that was all right and O.K., too.So it’s been disconcerting in recent years to see Northwestern be competitive in the Big Ten and regularly appear in bowl games. Right now, as The Times noted with bemusement last week, it leads its division, with a 5-1 conference record.The school has invested plenty in the team; a couple of months ago an indoor practice field on prime lakefront property opened, part of a $270 million complex that Northwestern hopes will lure recruits and render practices more efficient — and make the team more competitive in a conference that has a lucrative television deal. It’s a commonplace for non-athletes to complain about too many resources being devoted to athletics, but colleges should spend money on sports for a lively campus and to promote students’ health. And there’s the problem: Football’s not healthy.So it’s been much more than disconcerting that my alma mater’s success, and its big investment in the sport, comes as we are being reminded every day of the price football players pay in traumatic brain injury. The rash of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among N.F.L. players has gotten the most attention, but college players are hurt, too. Some colleges, like Dartmouth, are trying ways to reduce these injuries by eliminating tackling in practice and taking other measures, but they remain outliers.News of Northwestern’s triumphs now just serves as a reminder that there are real young men behind those wins whose brains are being battered. I want the Wildcats to win less so they won’t play as much.It’s also making me increasingly uncomfortable about giving to my old school. When I donate nowadays, I make sure to earmark my gift so it won’t be applied to the football team in some way, but I’m wondering if I’m still making myself complicit by donating at all to a university that is willing to risk its students’ health and happiness for a share of television revenue.The Wildcats play Iowa on Saturday. A victory would put them a step closer to the Big Ten championship game after the regular season. I’ll root for them to play safe — and lose."
"ATLANTA — Hours before the sport’s biggest game, President Trump joined the growing ranks of parents anxious over tackle football, saying in an interview he “would have a hard time” letting his 12-year-old son play.“I mean, it’s a dangerous sport and I think it’s, I, it’s really tough” if his son wanted to take up the game, Mr. Trump said in an interview with CBS ahead of its Sunday evening broadcast of the Super Bowl.The president’s concerns are at odds with his previous criticism that the N.F.L. has been making the game too soft to avoid concussions and other injuries, and suggest that he is struggling with many of the same questions that parents across the country are asking about the safety of youth tackle football.Mr. Trump said he would ultimately let his youngest son, Barron, who plays soccer, decide if he wanted to play tackle football and would not steer him away from the sport.[Super Bowl 2019: Game time, live updates and scores.]But the president said he had seen reports about the dangers of playing tackle football, and heard that some N.F.L. players were not letting their sons play tackle football.His comments added another wrinkle to his ambivalent relationship with the game he often celebrates, but also laments. His doubts about the safety of the game come five years after President Barack Obama said that if he had a son, he would not let him play professional football.Some studies have suggested that playing tackle football before age 12 puts athletes at a higher risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, but the issue has not been widely studied. In general, there has been growing awareness of C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease many former players have developed from repeated hits to the head.As a result of such concerns, participation in flag football has exploded.Yet while Mr. Obama held a forum at the White House on the dangers of concussions, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said the N.F.L. is being overprotective.In September 2017, for instance, Mr. Trump complained that the N.F.L. was ruining the game because the referees were trying to control unnecessarily rough tackles.“Today if you hit too hard — 15 yards! Throw him out of the game!” he said, adding: “They’re ruining the game! They’re ruining the game. That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game.”At a campaign rally in 2016, Mr. Trump referred to a woman in the audience who fainted, but returned to the crowd.“The woman was out cold and now she’s coming back,” he said. “See? We don’t go by these new, and very much softer, N.F.L. rules. Concussion. Oh, oh! Got a little ding on the head. No, no, you can’t play for the rest of the season. Our people are tough.”Trump also called the N.F.L. “soft” for penalizing helmet-to-helmet hits.In the CBS interview, however, he sounded more cautionary notes.“I hate to say it, because I love to watch football,” Mr. Trump said. “I think the N.F.L. is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son — well, I’ve heard N.F.L. players saying they wouldn’t let their sons play football. So, it’s not totally unique, but I, I would have a hard time with it.”"
"Paul Zimmerman, a pro football writer whose deep understanding of the game informed his work at Sports Illustrated and influenced the way other reporters covered the sport, died on Thursday in Noblesville, Ind. Also known as Dr. Z, he was 86.His wife, Linda Bailey Zimmerman, confirmed the death, at an assisted living facility.Mr. Zimmerman’s tenure at Sports Illustrated ended in 2008, when he had three strokes that left him unable to write and read and almost unable to speak.Over nearly 30 years at the magazine, his sharp writing and sophisticated dissection of the complexities of football gave him a national voice. He could tell the story of a Super Bowl with a mastery of play-calling or write revealing profiles of players and coaches.“He made people understand how difficult the game was to understand and taught us not to try to oversimplify it,” Peter King, a former longtime Sports Illustrated pro football writer, said in a telephone interview. “He never wanted to take the easy way out.”Reconstructing the San Francisco 49ers’ winning drive in the 1981 National Football Conference championship game against the Dallas Cowboys, Mr. Zimmerman wrote about the spectacular touchdown pass from the 49er quarterback, Joe Montana, to Dwight Clark.“It was the play that had given the 49ers their first touchdown, Solomon slotted inside Clark on the right side and breaking to the corner after Clark had cleared out underneath in a semi-pick,” he wrote in Sports Illustrated. But if Solomon was covered, he added, Clark would cut across the end zone, “right to left, doing an about-face and breaking back right.”“Montana, rolling to his right, had to find him.”Montana found a leaping Clark (“who climbed the sky wire”) in the back of the end zone for the game-tying score with 51 seconds left. The 49ers won, 28-27, on an extra point, then defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl.Before there was an internet, before websites detailed the minutiae of each game, Mr. Zimmerman produced his own charts, filled with game specifics, large and small, that helped him tell his stories. In “The Franchise” (1997), a book about the history of Sports Illustrated, Michael MacCambridge wrote that Mr. Zimmerman charted games with “different squiggles denoting pass, run or punt, his tiny script indicating the ball carrier or receiver.”Mr. Zimmerman charted virtually everything else that occurred on a football field as well, including the length of the national anthem.Paul Lionel Zimmerman was born on Oct. 23, 1932, in Philadelphia and soon moved with his parents to Manhattan. His father, Charles, was a garment industry union leader and co-chairman of the Socialist Party-Democratic Socialist Federation. His mother, Rose (Prepstein) Zimmerman, was a dressmaker.Paul played football at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx and then at Stanford and Columbia. As an offensive lineman, he understood the importance of the trench battles between offensive and defensive players, a view later reflected in his writings.He earned a master’s degree in journalism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism before starting a newspaper career with The Sacramento Bee, and later worked for The New York Journal-American, The New York World-Telegram and Sun and The New York Post.At The Post, he covered the New York Jets and chronicled their rise to the Super Bowl championship in 1969, led by Joe Namath.Gerald Eskenazi, the Jets beat reporter for The New York Times in those days, recalled Mr. Zimmerman in an email as “the rival reporter I feared the most.”“On Mondays after a Jets game,” he wrote, “I would reluctantly pick up The New York Post to see what angle I missed in the game, what quote he got.”Mr. Zimmerman burnished his football-expert credentials with the publication of “A Thinking Man’s Guide to Pro Football” (1970), which he revised in 1984. In his review of the original version, the Times sports columnist Robert Lipsyte praised Mr. Zimmerman for having a “clear and skeptical eye and the rare gift of being interesting and technical at the same time.”At Sports Illustrated, Mr. Zimmerman became known for his mock N.F.L. drafts, for answering letters about football and various other subjects, including wine (about which he had a column in The Post) and for picking winners each week.Leading off his bettor’s guide to Week 12 of the 2008 football season — one of the last things he wrote before his first stroke — he advised readers: “You’re going to see a parade of underdogs that will blow your head off. So wear a hat.”Before his illness, he had completed an autobiography, “Dr. Z: The Lost Memoirs of an Irreverent Football Writer.” But it took until last year for it to be published, with help from Mr. King, who now works for NBC Sports.In addition to his wife, Linda, Mr. Zimmerman is survived by his daughter, Sarah Zimmerman; his son, Michael; a stepson, Nathan Bailey; a stepdaughter, Heather Snopek; and a granddaughter.In 2014, six years into his stroke-imposed silence, Mr. Zimmerman starred in a nine-minute video, “Yours Truly, Dr. Z,” produced by NFL Films. In the video, the actor Tom Wopat narrates a script by Ken Rodgers based largely on what Mr. Zimmerman had written in the past. The collaboration earned Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Zimmerman a Sports Emmy for outstanding writing.“Ken did his homework,” Ms. Bailey Zimmerman said in a telephone interview, “and could do the dialogue as if Paul was talking.”"
"NEW YORK — Brian Banks, whose story of being wrongfully accused of rape will be a feature film in August, has a memoir coming out the month before.Atria Books announced Tuesday that Banks' ""What Set Me Free"" will be published July 2. Banks said in a statement that he wants to call attention to ""a flawed judicial system."" The film ""Brian Banks"" stars Aldis Hodge and Greg Kinnear and comes out Aug. 9.Banks, a high school football star at the time he was accused, served more than five years in prison after agreeing to a plea deal on rape and kidnapping charges. He was released in 2007, but had to register as a sex offender. His accuser later recanted her claim and Banks was exonerated in 2012."
"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did."
"Johnny (Lam) Jones, a former Olympic gold medal sprinter and swift-footed football star at the University of Texas who never lived up to his promise as a football professional with the Jets, died on Friday. He was 60.His death was announced by the university, which said it came “after a lengthy battle with cancer.” Texas news organizations said he died in a hospital in Round Rock, Tex., north of Austin.Jones learned that he had multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, in 2005. Because he did not have health insurance, former Texas teammates raised money for his medical costs.Jones was phenomenon at his central Texas high school, in the city of Lampasas, running world-class times of 9.21 seconds for 100 yards and 10.14 for 100 meters.After graduating, he competed that summer in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, finishing sixth in the 100 meters and winning a gold medal running the second leg of the United States 4x100-meter relay team.He then enrolled at Texas, where his speed landed him on both the track and football teams. He would go on to become a record-setting All-American sprinter for the university.In his freshman year he ran in the same backfield as another Johnny Jones. To distinguish the two, Coach Darrell Royal gave one the nickname Lam, for Jones’s hometown, and the other the nickname Ham, because that Jones came from Hamlin, Tex.Lam Jones, at 5 feet 11 and 190 pounds, was a wide receiver in his last three years as a Longhorn, 1977-79, and an All-American in his senior year. He scored eight touchdowns of 45 yards or more at Texas and was chosen the team’s most valuable player in 1978.In the 1980 National Football League draft, the Jets traded two first-round picks to be able to move up and make Jones their first pick (and the draft’s second choice overall). He signed for $2.1 million over six years (the equivalent of $6.8 million today); it was pro football’s first million-dollar contract.But his pro career was an injury-ridden disappointment. In his first season in New York, he caught 25 passes but dropped 18. In his second season, his main job was to run in plays from the Jets’ offensive coordinator, Joe Walton, to the quarterback, Richard Todd. The New York Times sports columnist Dave Anderson called him “the Jets’ millionaire messenger.”There were a few highlights for Jones that season, however, including catching a 47-yard touchdown pass from Todd in a playoff-clinching 28-3 victory over the Green Bay Packers at Shea Stadium in New York. (The Jets, in the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, went on to lose to the Buffalo Bills in a wild-card game the next week.)In five seasons (1980-84) with the Jets, Jones suffered a broken collarbone, a pulled hamstring and a torn finger tendon. He spent 1985 and 1986 on the Jets’ injured reserve list. The next year, the Jets traded him to the San Francisco 49ers.“I know how they remember me in New York: I’m the guy they blew the draft pick on,” Jones told The Daily News in 2005. “That’s O.K. I didn’t live up to their expectations, but I didn’t live up to my own expectations, either.”He did worse in San Francisco: The 49ers promptly waived him in training camp. He then joined the Dallas Cowboys, who dropped him after he missed a morning meeting because, the team said, he had been drinking and had overslept.Indeed, he told The News that he had struggled with alcohol and cocaine addictions both during his playing days and afterward.As a pro, Jones caught 138 passes for 2,322 yards and 13 touchdowns. His best season was in 1983, with 43 catches, 734 yards and four touchdowns.“Games and challenges never scared Johnny,” Bill Little, an assistant athletic director at Texas, recalled on a Texas football website in 2004. “People did. Folks thought he was just extremely shy and sometimes rude. Years later, they would diagnose the condition he had as social anxiety disorder.”In 1988, his playing days over and living again in Texas, Jones served a month in jail after pleading guilty to indecency with a child, a 12-year-old girl. The episode was a turning point, he later said, compelling him to seek treatment for his addictions.“I needed to get my personal life in order,” he was quoted as saying. “I came back to live in the real world.”He sold cars and running tracks, made motivational speeches to high school athletes and was active with the Texas Special Olympics.In 1979, Jones donated his Olympic gold medal to the Special Olympics. Years later, he explained why: “I’d never seen anyone stop in a race and help someone who had fallen get up.”John Wesley Jones II was born on April 4, 1958, in Lawton, Okla., to John W. Jones and Mary Jones Dillon. His father was an Army sergeant who was later transferred to Texas.Lam Jones was married and divorced three times. There was no immediate information available about survivors.Jones was philosophical about the up-and-down course his life had taken. He was quoted by Bill Little on the Texas website: “I got to run in the Olympics, got a great education and played for the University of Texas and played for the New York Jets.”“I learned a lot,” he added, “and I had some tough lessons.”"
"Over the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”"
"BRIGHAM CITY, Utah — A former Utah State University football player convicted of sexually assaulting six women was sentenced Wednesday to 26 years to life in prison during a hearing in which the judge called his actions ""horrendous"" and told his victims he believed them.Torrey Green, 25, was accused by six women of being sexually assaulted while on dates with him between 2013-2015, and jurors convicted him in January of crimes that included raping five women and sexual battery of a sixth.Utah district judge Brian Cannell said during the sentencing in the northern Utah city of Brigham City that he was disappointed that Green never showed remorse, The Salt Lake Tribune reported .""What you did was horrendous,"" Cannell said. ""In the eyes of the law, you are a serial rapist. They didn't want it. They didn't like it.""Green again denied the allegations during the sentencing, echoing the claim he made during the trial that the sexual encounters either were consensual or didn't happen. Green cried while saying he wasn't a ""monster"" as he was portrayed.""I am horrified at the way these women describe my encounters with each of them,"" Green said. ""I don't know why these six believe that I am capable of raping them. This was all consensual. And I am so very sorry that they didn't feel the same.""Green, of Rubidoux, California, signed as a rookie lineman for the Atlanta Falcons in 2016 after his college career ended, but the NFL team dropped him that same year after the allegations surfaced.Most of the sentences imposed Wednesday by for Torrey Green will run consecutively, with some to run concurrently.Skye Lazaro, Green's attorney, asked the judge to give Green five years to life, but prosecutor Spencer Walsh countered that Green should serve time for each crime, or it would be a ""terrible message"" to the victims.""The defendant sexually assaulted six women,"" Walsh said. ""Six separate and unique individuals. Six human beings. Six lives that were traumatized and forever changed.""Before he handed down his sentence, Judge Cannell looked at the six victims seated in the courtroom and said, ""I believe you."""
"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans.Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross’s Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket.“Larry’s done a great job,” Ross said. “He set the bar high, and it’s all great for tennis. But for us, it’s more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way.”Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go.Rather than see the tournament — and its hundreds of millions in local revenue — uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue.The move wasn’t well received by everyone.“Key Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can’t beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,” said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. “We had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me.”At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts — all permanent — were built on top of parking lots.On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon’s Henman Hill, minus the grass.The change recalls the United States Open’s move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.“This place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,” said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins’ chief executive. “We are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L.”Tournament organizers did not take the word “luxury” lightly. The stadium court — painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue — seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court.Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million.Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis.“There’s a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,” said James Blake, the tournament director.Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls.“I had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,” said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan’s Hudson Yards project. “It’s all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they’re watching for those details.”The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men’s and women’s singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages.But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians.“What we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,” said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG’s parent company. “Key Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we’ve got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we’re the new U.S. Open.”"
" Before reading the article: With the Super Bowl approaching, it’s a good time to appreciate the athletic prowess of N.F.L. athletes.Watch the three videos of one-handed catches featured in the article.Which catch do you think was the best or most impressive, and why?Now, read the article, “Grab and Go: How Sticky Gloves Have Changed Football,” and answer the following questions: 1. The article begins, “One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.” Why did David Waldstein, the author, choose a play from 40 years ago to open the piece? Why does he suggest that Smith’s fortune might have been different if he were playing football today?2. Mr. Waldstein writes: “When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex.” In your own words, explain the science involved when a player catches a ball while wearing silicone gloves.3. What properties of the silicone glove are most surprising or interesting to you? How does Mr. Waldstein help the reader visualize how the gloves work on a microscopic level?4. How did Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., test the gloves to determine how much “tackiness” they provide for users? How much stickier is the glove than a human hand?5. Jeff Beraznik first had the idea of a sticky football glove as a football player at the University of Ottawa. How did his pursuit of the perfect glove lead him to Karachi, Pakistan? What does his story tell you about the nature of innovation?6. Why was Stickum, an earlier product used by wide receivers, outlawed by the N.F.L.? How do silicone gloves meet the criteria of the current rule book?7. Odell Beckham Jr. is widely seen as the master of the one-handed catch. How has he influenced other receivers playing the game? How has the one-handed catch changed football?Finally, tell us more about what you think: — What’s your reaction to the article? Are you more or less impressed by the athletic prowess of N.F.L. wide receivers?— According to the article:Do you think athletes should be able to use technology to improve their performance? Or do you think they give some athletes an unfair advantage? Does advanced equipment diminish or strengthen individuals’ talent and the sport over all? Why do you think so?— If you do think technology is acceptable in sports, should there be limits on the amount or type of equipment that athletes can use?

"NEW YORK — The Alliance of American Football league is suspending operations before it can crown its first champions, but that is not stopping FanDuel's sportsbook from declaring a winner. FanDuel Group, a unit of Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair PLC, on Wednesday said the Orlando Apollos should have been the AAF champs and that it would pay out all straight futures wagers as winners.""For the fans that bet on the AAF, the least they should expect is for a competition to conclude as it should,"" FanDuel said in a statement. ""We believe this is the very definition of a bad beat for sports fans everywhere.""The payouts apply to bets in New Jersey since FanDuel did not take any bets on the AAF in West Virginia or Pennsylvania, where it also operates sportsbooks.This week, AAF owner Tom Dundon suspended operations after only eight weeks of game play following a number of operational and financial setbacks, according to media reports.As the new legal U.S. sports betting market grows state by state, some operators have chosen to refund or pay out wagers where they think betters have gotten an especially bad break.Such moves can serve to win over betters to legal, regulated bookmakers instead of the many pervasive illegal offshore websites.In February, PointsBet refunded New Jerseyans' wagers after Duke University star player Zion Williamson's sneaker split open.

"LAKE FOREST, Ill. — During practice last Thursday afternoon, Tarik Cohen caught a punt. Still clutching the ball, he proceeded to catch another. And another. And another. And another. And another.And another.By the end of this wacky experiment, Cohen was cradling seven balls — one, roughly, for every role he has with the Chicago Bears.Cohen is — O.K., deep breath — the Bears’ handoff-taking, punt-returning, ball-catching, pass-throwing, mismatch-creating, gasp-inducing, highlight-monopolizing cyborg. A year after becoming the first rookie since Gale Sayers, a former Bear, in 1965, to contribute touchdowns by running, receiving, passing and punt return, Cohen has further obliterated concerns that a 5-foot-6 running back from the humble Football Championship Subdivision would struggle transitioning to the N.F.L.’s rugged N.F.C. North.[Wild-Card Weekend: Our Predictions for the N.F.L. Playoffs]If the quarterback-wrecking edge rusher Khalil Mack embodies a defense that has fueled the Bears’ worst-to-first ascent — as the N.F.C.’s third seed, they’ll face the No. 6-seeded Eagles in the wild-card round on Sunday, their first playoff appearance since 2010 — Cohen personifies the offense installed by the team’s first-year coach, Matt Nagy: creative, unpredictable and, at times, downright fun. Nagy has maximized Cohen’s speed, suddenness and receiving skills by aligning him around the formation, from the backfield to the inside to the outside, turning him into, in effect, Chicago’s offensive version of Mack: the player opponents must stalk wherever he is on the field. He led the team in catches (71), yards from scrimmage (1,169) and all-purpose yardage (1,599), and was voted onto the All-Pro team as punt returner.“He’s got a lot of strengths and not a lot of weaknesses,” Nagy said. “Having him be a part of what we do and what we scheme is a huge advantage.”Soon after the Bears hired Nagy away from Kansas City, where he served for five seasons on Andy Reid’s staff, Cohen heard that last season the Chiefs featured three players who gained more than 1,000 yards: receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce and running back Kareem Hunt. Cohen did not know when or how he would get the ball in Chicago, he said, only that he would.“Get me the ball and get me in space,” Cohen said.That just might be his motto. His 170 touches rank second on the team, behind Jordan Howard, the primary rusher. As a runner, Cohen has the seventh-best breakaway percentage in the N.F.L., gaining 44.4 percent of his 444 yards on carries of at least 15 yards, according to Pro Football Focus. As a receiver, Cohen averages 10.2 yards per reception, most among the 20 backs with at least 40 catches, according to Pro Football Reference.As the position has evolved, a hybridized strain of running back has permeated the league, players as comfortable with, and capable of, lining up in the slot or being split wide as they are rushing 20 times per game. Cohen does not run as often as other versatile second-year dynamos like the Panthers’ Christian McCaffrey or the Saints’ Alvin Kamara, but his proficiency in the passing game — his 175 snaps away from the backfield were the most among running backs — has made him, according to Pro Football Focus’s Wins Above Replacement metric, the second-most valuable player at his position, just behind McCaffrey.“I don’t think there’s anything he can’t do,” Bears running back Benny Cunningham said.The Bears’ vast playbook — Minnesota Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer quipped earlier this season that it contained 800 plays — demands Cohen know entire passing concepts because any week he could line up at four or five different spots. His first-year position coach, Charles London, marveled early on at Cohen’s savvy — how he can see a drawing or a video of a play and master his responsibilities on the field in a repetition or two. His improvement as a blocker has helped Chicago disguise its calls, diminishing tendencies that his alignment might have tipped off.“There’s not really a route — at running back or receiver — that he can’t run in this offense,” London said.That was Cohen’s objective during the off-season, he said, when he devoted two days a week to refining routes that come back to the ball, like curls, during seven-on-seven drills with his former North Carolina A&T teammates. He did not want to be branded as only a deep-ball threat, just as he does not want to be perceived as strictly a perimeter runner, someone unwilling — or worse, not stout enough — to run between the tackles.Further evidence: Ask Cohen his top play from this season, and he mentions not the 70-yard screen against the Jets, the 50-yard catch-and-dash at Miami or the overtime-forcing touchdown toss at the Giants. In his mind, all the feints, cutbacks and bursts that evoke his favorite player, Reggie Bush, do not compare to the punt he fielded midway through the first quarter against New England in Week 7, when he stepped left, cut right, then zipped left again, shedding a tackle at his feet before encountering a defender by the boundary squaring up to level him.The contact was brief. The defender crumpled. Cohen did not.“Somebody so small running somebody big over — it makes everybody’s day,” Cohen said.Cohen is short but, listed at 181 pounds, not small. He is thick and sturdy, with disproportionately enormous hands — size 10? from thumb to pinkie, bigger than those of hulking receiving threats like Kelce, Julio Jones and A.J. Green — that help him do things like, say, hold on to seven balls at the same time.Growing up in rural Bunn, N.C., about 30 miles northeast of Raleigh, Cohen specialized in such exploits. For one, he developed his speed — like another Bears playmaker before him — through unorthodox methods. Instead of running through tall, thick grass, as Devin Hester did, Cohen dodged the pit bulls that he said roamed his neighborhood.“It’s fight or flight,” Cohen said. “Either get going or you’re going to get eat, so you’ve got to get out of there.”He did get out of there — to play football, but barely. Had North Carolina A&T, a historically black university, not offered him a scholarship, Cohen would have joined the Navy.Why?“I knew how to swim,” said Cohen, sitting in the Halas Hall lobby before practice one day last week. “And it wasn’t like people were getting killed in the Navy.”Rather than enlist, Cohen opted to dominate the F.C.S. Across his four seasons at A&T, he rushed for a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 5,619 yards, the 10th-most in the history of what was formerly Division I-AA. But when N.F.L. scouts passed through Greensboro, said Shawn Gibbs, his position coach at A&T, some seemed unconvinced.“They just tried to poke holes in everything he did — like, he’s good, but,” Gibbs said. “The guys that were like: ‘Man, this guy can walk under this table. I can’t take him to my G.M.’ Those were the guys that were frustrating.”It was the Bears’ good fortune that their scout who prowls the Southeast, Sam Summerville, attended a historically black college himself. Before even studying Cohen, Summerville admired him as a fan, watching from afar as he rushed for 295 yards — and touchdowns of 74, 83 and 73 yards — against Alcorn State in the Celebration Bowl.The deeper he probed, the more Summerville believed in Cohen. Not as a gadget player, but as an N.F.L. running back. At Summerville’s urging, the Bears deployed additional scouts to evaluate him, and they, too, grew enamored. Still, as they prepped for the 2017 draft, Summerville expected pushback — for everything from Cohen’s statistics, perceived to be inflated by the lesser competition, to his stature. So he relied on emotion as much as reason to convey why they needed him.In an impassioned plea, Summerville showed his colleagues the clip of Cohen catching two balls while doing a back flip. (Yes, really.) He affirmed that rival coaches feared no player more than Cohen. He explained that of the 350 to 400 players he assessed in the fall of 2016, Cohen was “definitely” his favorite.“It got to the point where some of the other scouts may have been rolling their eyes a little bit, like, ‘this guy’s serious,’” Summerville said. “Every time I opened my mouth about him, or every time a question was asked, they were like, ‘Do you think this guy can do this?’ Tarik can do pretty much everything you ask him to.”The Bears chose Cohen with one of their fourth-round selections — they took another foundational player, safety Eddie Jackson, seven picks earlier — and before he even took a snap, Cunningham exhorted his friends to draft him for their fantasy football teams. Many satisfied customers, he said.Over the summer, Summerville reviewed his reports on Cohen, to check whether reality matched projections. It did not. Cohen surpassed them. One after another after another after another.And another."
"I have decided to stop watching football given the recent findings about the frequency with which concussions occur and the long-term effects of those concussions on the players. I am not trying to take a stand and change any of my family’s or friends’ opinions, but I do want to feel like I’m doing my part. Can I still follow my team in some way, though? I’m a Jets fan (O.K., maybe I’m not giving up much by not watching), and I really like keeping up with their season. What involvement with the team would be ethical? Can I read up on the team in the newspaper? What if I walk into a restaurant and a game is on television? Is it O.K. if I watch it there? After all, they’ve chosen to play, and maybe I should respect that. Name WithheldA body of research suggests that football causes long-term brain damage in many players. Still, as you point out, the players are in a position to decide for themselves whether they want to run the risks. Those who do well in the sport expect to earn more money and more glory than they would in another endeavor. So you could just think this puts the responsibility on them. If they’re rational, they are, in effect, making the judgment that they are better off playing than not, even with a serious prospect of incurring chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), not to mention other chronic injuries and conditions.That’s not the end of the discussion, though. When it comes to exposing workers to hazards, our views aren’t straightforward. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2016 show 24,650 nonfatal injuries among construction workers, 28,740 injuries among local law-enforcement officers, 80,180 injuries among those for whom driving is part of their job. If you choose to be a roofer rather than a groundskeeper and accept a greater risk of injury for more pay, we’re O.K. with that. But the reason we have OSHA standards is that we think measures to abate hazards should be taken where feasible. The potential for grievous injury is surely part of why people watch Nascar races; we still expect drivers to use six-point harnesses and flame-retardant suits.It isn’t obvious how this principle should be applied to a game like football. Some think that new high-tech helmets will help; others argue that no helmets at all would be safer, because (as in rugby) it might discourage head collisions. Players spend much more time in practice than in actual games, and some think that practice needs to be reformed to avoid the subconcussive impacts that have been linked to C.T.E. There’s more research to be done, more rethinking of the rules of the game. Players who lower their heads and initiate helmet contact can now be penalized, and maybe there’s a way to expand that penalty category. The existing penalties can certainly be increased and made more of a deterrent. Shortening the preseason could help, too. But if you really care about the welfare of football players, you should want not just to turn your back on bad practices but also to advocate for better ones.A utilitarian, who assesses actions by their effects, would point out that nothing you’re proposing to do contributes to that effort. You can avoid newspaper coverage or screens in sports bars, but given your refusal to urge anyone else to refrain from attending or watching games, that gesture will be undetectable to the football authorities, not to mention sports journalists, and puts no pressure on them. (At least in picking the Jets to follow you’ve made it easier to skip every Super Bowl, from which fate seems to have decided they would be excluded for the past half-century.)But again, that’s not the end of the discussion. Might there be a reason to shun a harmful activity even if doing so won’t have beneficial effects? There are two lines of argument to consider here: one associated with Immanuel Kant and the other with Aristotle. A Kantian test for assessing an action is to consider whether it flows from a principle that you’d have reason to want everyone to follow. Let’s suppose everyone’s boycotting football would lead to swift changes to make the game much safer or even bring the sport to an end. (Here, the utilitarian would note that the end of football might lead to worse lives for those who now play the game at all levels and to the loss not just of a lot of pleasure among fans but also of jobs for commentators, stadium staff, officials and the like.) You can still wonder whether that Kantian strategy of the universalized maxim matters if, in the real world, none of your sports-fan friends are going to follow your lead.One reason to refrain from fandom is simply that you may not want to be the sort of person who takes pleasure in a game that is causing serious and unnecessary harm to its players. An approach to ethics that focuses on what kind of person you are — so-called virtue ethics — is often associated with Aristotle. It tends to judge action in terms of character, rather than the other way around, and you hear its echoes in a familiar formula of reproval: “What kind of person would ... ?”Let me offer a final consideration: In following the game, in joining the culture that sustains football, in its current form, as an American institution, you are not causing harm directly — but you are, in a sense, participating in causing harm. You’ve been enlisted in a collective action that you view with disapproval. In this regard, you can be part of the problem, even if the problem would persist if you weren’t.My husband and I are struggling to conceive. We’ve been seeing a fertility specialist and going through cycles of treatment. We started with oral medications, to which unfortunately I stopped responding. We have since moved on to injectable medications. If this doesn’t work, we’ll at some point have to start thinking about IVF. Though I desperately want to have a baby of our own, I’m struggling with whether it is ethical to go through the rather incredible lengths to get pregnant that IVF requires when there are children who urgently need homes. I know that the cost of adoption, and the difficulty of actually successfully adopting a baby, make it likely as emotionally grueling (and more expensive than) as an IVF cycle. Still, the effort would go to providing a home for a baby who needs one. More pressing is the number of children in the foster-care system. We’ve talked about fostering children in the future, but in our minds that would occur after we’d had some experience parenting. I do not feel that right now we could take on the enormous responsibility of foster care. I do feel we are ready for a baby of our own; children in foster care generally need a great deal more than a new baby does.The bottom line is this: Though I want to have a biological child, and my husband definitely does want to go to IVF if it comes to that, I am struggling to wrap my head around going through so much intervention when we could instead take in a child who needs a home. Am I off base here, or do we have a duty to give homes to children who need them when we can’t easily have children of our own? Name WithheldTaking on a child who already exists and needs a home is an enormously worthy thing to do, if you’re confident that you can bond with him or her and create a loving environment. But you don’t have a duty to adopt one. There are many things we each could do — such as being a parent to one of the hundred thousand or so foster children in this country who need a new family — that would improve the world. But morality doesn’t demand that we do all the good we can. If you had a duty to adopt a foster child, it wouldn’t be enormously worthy, just required.Plenty of couples want to conceive but would choose to have no children rather than adopt a foster child. That’s essentially the position you’re in: You don’t feel prepared to provide foster care. It follows that a child you and your husband might have together wouldn’t be depriving a foster child of a home. And you’re not obliged to remain childless."
"To the Editor:Re “The Kids Who Still Need Football,” by Albert Samaha (Sunday Review, Sept. 9):As a physician, a parent and a citizen, I was disheartened by this article. What a tragedy it is in this day and age when two bright young students and many others have to risk brain damage as a ticket to college rather than using their brains to carry them to success.Studies have shown that the earlier that children are exposed to tackle football, the greater the risk of the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E. Football is a deep part of our culture, but every school system and youth league should require every parent and student athlete to attend a session on the risks of football and the future effects of C.T.E.I also encourage every parent and athlete to see the movie “Concussion,” the true story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, who fought against the National Football League to expose the risks of C.T.E. for the players. It is a riveting account of the dangers of football. As a society, we must do better to help our children get an education without putting their futures at risk.Kenneth OlshanskyGlen Allen, Va.To the Editor:More anti-football blathering by The Times. Reality, as always, is more complicated. The fact remains that football has been played by tens of millions of boys and men over the last hundred years or so, and the vast majority have gone on to live full, healthy and productive lives. Yet reporting is typically narrowly focused on long-term National Football League players who tragically suffer from health issues.Many men in varied professions have played football, loved it and attribute playing the game to the success they’ve had later in life. Why don’t we ever hear these stories?Of course, it is also true that football is dangerous, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy is real. Much is already being done, including numerous rule changes and concussion protocol programs, to make the game safer. Indeed, it is dramatically safer now than it was even five years ago, yet more can and should be done. It’s a game worth saving.Rich BurkeAlexandria, Va.To the Editor:Albert Samaha’s critique of educational inequality is compelling, but his argument that football and accompanying scholarships can be a rational choice for children of color is dangerously shortsighted. In the largest study to date, chronic traumatic encephalopathy was found in 90 percent of college football players whose brains were examined. (Yes, the sample size was small, and there was selection bias, but how many college presidents would take a job where there is an excellent chance they would suffer dementia by 50?) Ironically, most schools with football programs also maintain tobacco-free campuses, yet football’s risks are as clear as tobacco’s — and those risks are borne disproportionately by blacks. David R.

"HANOVER, N.H. — The earliest football game between two eventual members of the Ivy League took place when Columbia played Yale in 1872. Dartmouth’s football team had its first intercollegiate game in 1881, several years before the sport was formally introduced at Ohio State and Alabama.This is supposedly the league of football the way it once was. But today, in this northern outpost of the Ancient Eight, a program soaked in football’s past is trying to drag the sport into the future.In 2010, the Big Green eliminated tackling in all practices — even preseason camp and spring ball. Coach Buddy Teevens likes to say that a freshman will play four years without being tackled by another Dartmouth player. The N.C.A.A. has since recommended dialing back contact significantly in practice.A couple of years ago, Dartmouth began using moving robots as tackling dummies. The tall, remote-controlled cones of padding whir along Memorial Field’s turf like R2-D2. Now, more than half of N.F.L. teams, several dozen college programs and around 100 high schools have these mobile virtual players, or M.V.P.s, Teevens said.Last month, the team hired Callie Brownson as offensive quality control coach, making her the first full-time female coach in the history of Division I football.All three innovations, Teevens said, were geared toward making football safer, minimizing the head trauma that scientists have linked to degenerative brain disorders like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E.Brownson is a trailblazer in football and an aberration in Division I men’s sports, where fewer than 10 percent of assistant coaches are women, according to Richard Lapchick, an advocate for diversity in sports.As an intern in Dartmouth’s football program, Brownson had impressed the staff and players. Teevens first encountered her and other female coaches at the Manning Passing Academy, a skills camp he helped found, with Archie Manning and his famous sons, when he was Tulane’s head coach a quarter-century ago. He realized there were many women coaching youth football, and he wanted them “to come in and benefit the game,” he said — to learn his gospel of safety and then spread the good news.“If they’re coaching,” he said, “can they coach more safely?”Teevens, 62, casts his unusual policies as enlightened self-interest. Practices with less contact mean fewer injuries and fresher players. Never tackling teammates means more, and more precise, work on tackling technique. He estimates that Dartmouth has cut its missed tackles by two-thirds. (The M.V.P.s also represent another kind of enlightened self-interest: They were Teevens’s idea, and he is chairman of the company that manufactures them.)In 2010, the year Teevens got rid of tackling, Dartmouth had its first winning season in 13 years. In 2015, Dartmouth was 9-1 and won a share of the Ivy title. The one loss that year came against Harvard, which Dartmouth (6-0) faces this weekend.“This is probably the best Dartmouth team in the last 25 years,” said Tim Murphy, Harvard’s coach since 1994, calling the Big Green “as big and strong and physical a team as we’ll see all year.”Beyond wanting to win, Teevens is motivated by a fear that an irreplaceable sport could die.“I think it’s too valuable a game to say, ‘Oh, we’ll do something else,’” he said. “But I also look at the data and the medical side of it. Something has to be done.”The bet is that the sport can be salvaged by incremental changes that might help save players like Owen Thomas, a University of Pennsylvania team captain who hanged himself in 2010 and was then found to have C.T.E.“He’s trying to make his players safer in a way that hasn’t hurt them on the field,” said Chris Nowinski, a founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. “He’s proving we can change football, make it safer, work within the system.”“Will it save the game of football?” Teevens said. “I don’t know. But I think it’s a step in the right direction.”Every level of football has recently implemented measures to protect players’ brains. Youth leagues have adopted flag football. Something called “modified tackle” has infiltrated high schools. College football instituted severe penalties for “targeting.” The N.F.L. limited contact in in-season practices. Many college teams have elected to reduce contact in in-season practices, too.But the Ivy League — which besides Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn and Yale features Brown, Cornell and Princeton — is on another plane, Nowinski said. In 2016, after a unanimous coaches’ vote, it banned tackling during in-season practices, although teams other than Dartmouth still tackle in the spring or the preseason. (Along with Teevens, Harvard’s Murphy had already stopped in-season tackling.) The same year, the Ivy League altered kickoff rules to discourage returns. That reduced the concussion rate on football’s most dangerous play fivefold, according to a new medical study.During the same period, the league emerged as among the best at its level. Its out-of-conference record this season and last, 36-12, was tops in the Football Championship Subdivision.To be clear, Ivy League players still tackle one another in games. Also, at a recent practice, Dartmouth linemen collided violently after snaps, their helmets bashing against one another. Subconcussive hits delivered by such plays — which are routine and unavoidable for players who block or rush — have been linked to long-term cognitive impairment.Teevens drew a parallel to the time that President Theodore Roosevelt (Harvard class of 1880) convened a White House meeting with college sports officials, including Harvard’s and Princeton’s coaches, to address football safety. One solution they came up with was allowing the forward pass.“Here we are, the petri dish,” he said, “doing some stuff that maybe other people will feed off of.”Teevens speaks with the zeal of the convert and the monomania of the activist (as well as the thick accent of someone reared a short drive south of Boston).An all-Ivy quarterback at Dartmouth, he spent five years as his alma mater’s head coach and then took the top job at Tulane before the 1992 season. Later, he was an assistant at Florida under Steve Spurrier. In 2002, he was named head coach at Stanford, where he was 10-23.Teevens returned to Dartmouth in 2005, knowing it would probably be the final stop in his career. In his first five seasons, Dartmouth was 9-41. Inspired by medical research and advice from mentors like Spurrier and Bill Walsh to keep players healthy, he banned tackling.“We had guys banged up,” he said. “And part of it was, I think this is the right thing to do, and if this is my swan song, O.K.”The program improved drastically. “Not having that wear and tear every day is super helpful,” Drew Hunnicutt, a senior wide receiver, said.Teevens tinkers with tackling technique the way a French chef perfects his Hollandaise sauce. He and his staff broke down every tackle from the 2016 Ivy League season — 3,700 in all — to determine ideal style. He suggested the idea for the M.V.P.s to a college classmate now at Dartmouth’s engineering school with the purpose of simulating a moving target without using a player.The next frontier is blocking. Eliminating blocking would not so much reform football as fundamentally alter it. Teevens does not want to be the cause of lasting brain trauma, but he does not want football to end, either.He has been breaking down more tape. What if players learned to block lower, minimizing head-to-head contact?“That’s the thing I’m working on right now,” he said."
"If you like a lot of scoring and big blowouts in football, this is your week.On Monday night, expect plenty of points by both sides in the Chiefs-Rams game. Oddsmakers have set an over-under total on the game at a staggering 63 ½. That is the highest total in the history of the N.F.L. The average total score in an N.F.L. game this season is about 46.The biggest factor in setting a total is the teams’ ability to score. And the Chiefs and the Rams can. Kansas City is averaging 35.3 points a game; the Rams are at 33.5.“They are two of the most efficient offenses we’ve seen in the last 10 years,” said Scott Cooley, spokesman for the betting site BetDSI. “The rate at which they are scoring is phenomenal.”Cooley added that Chiefs Coach Andy Reid “kind of reinvented his entire playbook” and that now that he has quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Reid “has opened up even more.”Cooley called the Rams’ Sean McVay “as creative as any coach we’ve seen in his second year.”And that is just the offense. The state of the defenses matters too in the over-under.“The Chiefs’ defense is nothing to write home about,” Cooley said. “The Rams on paper have a good defense, but they’ve given up a lot of points this season as well.”When the big number was first posted earlier in the week, the game was scheduled to be played in Mexico City. At that point, the betting traffic was all one way, Cooley said.“A lot of the pro bettors were taking the under because of the field conditions, which can affect footing,” he said. “When you play at altitude, especially with two young quarterbacks, there would be an adjustment.”After the N.F.L. moved the game to Los Angeles on Tuesday because of the poor field conditions in Mexico, the high number looked realistic again.“Smart guys are going to bet it under,” said D. J. Fields, head trader at the BookMaker website. “The public will probably bet it over.""Bookmakers said the only team that could compete in scoring with the Chiefs and the Rams is New Orleans; a Rams-Saints game earlier in the year had a 57 over-under. A Rams-Saints playoff matchup is a strong possibility; it too should be a points-fest.In college football, it is the point spreads that are huge this weekend, as many top teams are taking some breathers.Among top-10 teams, Michigan is a 28-point favorite over Indiana; Clemson is 28 ½ over Duke; Oklahoma is 36 over Kansas; Georgia is 42 over Massachusetts; Louisiana State is 43 over Rice. And topping the list is Alabama, a mind-boggling 51 ½-point favorite over the Citadel, a Football Championship Subdivision team that has lost this season to Chattanooga and Furman.Setting those huge lines is not just a matter of determining how much better one team is than another.“Whatever Alabama wants to beat them by, they’ll beat them by,” said Ray Mitchell, head live trader at BookMaker. “If someone came to Alabama and said, ‘You’ve got to win by 65,’ they would win by 70 plus.”So the question becomes, how soon does Alabama start easing up? That’s hard for oddsmakers to predict.“It’s super tricky,” Mitchell said. “You look at what these coaches have done in the past. It’s really a pure guess; you put something reasonable up. You don’t have nearly as much confidence in your number. There’s so much variance in a game like this. Alabama can do whatever they want.”Of course, even if Alabama does bring in some backups, the margin may keep climbing.“Is Alabama’s second team three touchdowns better than Citadel’s first-team players?” Cooley said. “It’s probably safe to say that they are.”Some teams are a little more predictable in when they run up the score.“One team that sticks out to me is Clemson,” Cooley said. “Dabo Swinney seems to never really let his foot off the gas. They put 77 up on Louisville. Even in the second half, they’re calling long pass plays.”“L.S.U. is more of a grind-it-out team,” Mitchell said. “They enjoy running for 6 yards.”There won’t be a deluge of bettors for any of these games. “People are scared off by big spreads,” Cooley said. “It does deter people. This week is not a good week for the books or the fans.”If you’re not a gambler, these blowout games may not seem appetizing to watch. Bettors agree.“The more attractive a game is to the general fan, the more attraction you get from bettors,” Mitchell said. “Except the professionals, but they make up 1, 2 percent of the players.”Maybe taking the Citadel at plus 51 ½ is not risky enough for you. Maybe you think the Bulldogs can shock the world and win the game outright. Although point-spread betting is the most popular in the United States, books are increasingly offering straight-win betting. The Citadel is 2,000 to 1.If sure money is your kind of thing, bet on 10-0 Alabama. You’ll only have to bet $10,000 to win a buck."
"IRVINE, Calif. — Ryan Hilinski got the talk in March, two months after his older brother died.“You can walk away,” his parents, Mark and Kym, and eldest brother, Kelly, told him. Deep down, part of them would be relieved if he did. If he were younger, they would have forbidden him to play football altogether.But Ryan was almost 18 years old and one of the best high school quarterbacks in the country. ESPN would name him the top pro-style quarterback in the class of 2019. More than 30 colleges would offer him full scholarships, including blue bloods like Georgia, Ohio State and Louisiana State, and his childhood dream school, Stanford. He had worked too long and accomplished too much for them to take this away from him now.Only he could decide whether to keep pursuing the sport that may have led to his brother Tyler’s suicide, a death that stunned nearly everyone who knew him. One day Tyler was the likely starting quarterback for a team on the rise. The next, he was dead.Tyler Hilinski shot himself in a closet inside his Pullman, Wash., apartment on Jan. 16. He was 21. Four months earlier he had been carried off the field after leading the Washington State Cougars to an electric triple-overtime victory over Boise State. His parents last saw him alive a few weeks before his death, on a family vacation in Mexico. He seemed happy and healthy, which only haunts them further. Where were the warning signs that their middle son wanted to take his own life?“We have no clue what happened,” Mark said. “We will sit here for the next 20 years and not know what the heck happened to Tyler.”The biggest window into Tyler’s mind arrived posthumously, via a brain autopsy conducted by the Mayo Clinic. It revealed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease brought on by repeated head trauma. After researchers at Boston University studied the brains of 202 former football players — many families had donated them because of concerns the athletes had C.T.E. — they announced in 2017 that 87 percent of them had tested positive for the disease.Tyler’s death places him at the intersection of two troubling demographics: football players with severe brain damage and suicides among young people. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Americans ages 10 to 34. Together, they constitute thousands of lives lost each year, leaving untold thousands more behind to cobble together a life while grieving.For Mark and Kym, dealing with the loss meant starting a foundation, Hilinski’s Hope, which works to reduce the stigma around mental illness. Kelly, who studies medicine, changed his specialty from cardiovascular medicine to neurology.And for Ryan, it meant playing football. Everything he does, he said, will now be for him and his brother. He switched his jersey number to No. 3, which Tyler wore. He tattooed an outline of the lighthouse where they spread Tyler’s ashes on the inside of his right wrist so the football could touch a memory of his brother on every snap. Before his death, Tyler was Ryan’s first call every time he received a scholarship offer. After, Ryan immediately tweeted the news, always referring to Tyler in the announcement.“It’s basically like me telling him first,” he said.He also needed to find a way to play that would allow his family to experience the sport in peace, if that is possible anymore. Maybe it would have to be 2,500 miles away in a place where the Hilinskis could get a fresh start — or something that felt remotely like it.At Orange Lutheran High School, a tall red banner of Ryan hangs on a fence outside the main entrance, part of a series showcasing football players. He sings bass in the honors choir and booms Motown songs in the hallways. Prospective students shadow him on campus, and he once sat in on a school board meeting. He celebrates Mass every weekend. He sometimes stops by Hoag Hospital in Irvine to visit sick children.“Everyone meets him and they’re like, ‘Oh, he’s like a senator already,’” said J.P. Presley, Orange Lutheran’s football coach.It is a carefully applied veneer, one that predated Tyler’s death but has taken on additional importance since. Ryan is discerning about whom he lets in. Behind closed doors, Kelly said, “everyone kind of knows him as this squirrelly, goofy kid,” one who lives to play Fortnite and scarf down McDonald’s and beg Kym to do his laundry. Out in the world, Ryan is the star quarterback, the school figurehead and, now, the most visible representative of an increasingly public-facing family. He believes he no longer has the luxury of acting his age.“After Tyler passed, it’s kind of been like, ‘O.K., now I’m an adult,’” Ryan said. “I’ve got to grow up kind of in a hurry.”The Hilinski boys were always together, always in lock step. Wherever Kelly, 24, went, Tyler, 18 months his junior, would follow. And whenever his older brothers competed in something, Ryan tried to outdo them both. Their parents took to calling them “The Brothers,” not as a statement of fact but as a proper name for an indivisible unit. Before long, they referred to themselves that way, too.So when Kelly quit baseball before his freshman year of high school to play quarterback full time, his brothers inevitably followed suit. Ryan was so young that he cannot recall the first time he put on a helmet, only that it was to help his brothers practice running over a defender.For years, he toiled in their shadows, watching as Kelly left home to play football at Columbia — he would eventually transfer to Weber State — and later when Tyler set off for the Pac-12. Ryan vowed to climb higher and did so by trying to grow into an amalgamation of his brothers’ best qualities. On the field, he has Kelly’s cannon arm and Tyler’s moxie. Away from it, when he is at his best, he blends Kelly’s charisma with what everyone once saw as Tyler’s even keel.“The perfect mix of all of us,” Kelly said.Ryan was the one who tended to Kym when they got the news of Tyler’s death, staying with her as she hyperventilated and ultimately calling an ambulance to take her to a hospital. When Presley, Ryan’s coach, arrived to check on them, he found Ryan in the waiting room, “standing there like a brave warrior while everyone around is emotional.”In the months since, he has learned to cook, taken on extra chores and begun to handle his own media requests. He grits his teeth and stays silent when people mock Tyler’s death on social media. He has dealt with worse in person, like the opposing player who insulted Tyler during a game, or the classmate who waved a flier advertising a suicide awareness event in Ryan’s face and told him, “You should have told your brother to go to this.” Each time, Ryan walked away. Afterward, he would call Kelly to rage about their cruelty and his helplessness.“He can’t defend his brother,” Kelly said. “I can’t stress how hard that is, how tough that is on an 18-year-old boy, to keep that all in.”Football helps him cope, at a cost.On the one hand, the game provides an essential distraction.“When I’m on the field, I forget,” he said. “I say, ‘O.K., I’m going to focus on a slant route rather than: ‘When did it happen? What time of night was it when Tyler passed?’” He added, “Or I’m going to throw a post this time instead of saying, ‘Damn, what could I have done?’”But he can only compartmentalize so much while playing the same position and while dedicating so much of himself to preserving his brother’s memory. Ryan admits he tried to bottle up his grief before the season because he did not want “to let it affect the team.” He and Kelly saw a therapist together in the spring but stopped going because “we didn’t like expressing it.”Ryan instead finds solace in the early mornings, when he’ll wake up at 5:30 and drive to Newport Beach to run by the ocean. Afterward, he retreats to his car and sits alone in the parking lot, talking to Tyler as he watches the waves lap onto shore.The rigors of this season sometimes overwhelmed him. He sobbed so hard after his first touchdown pass that Mark ran down from the stands to embrace him, holding Ryan tight so his son would not collapse. One month later, Orange Lutheran lost after missing what would have been a game-winning field goal. Ryan approached his parents on the sideline. “Tyler would have won that game,” he croaked, using an expletive, before breaking down again.Everything about football now is distressing for the Hilinski family, and most likely always will be. They worry that Ryan could lose sight of where Tyler’s football dreams end and his own begin. “It can’t just be for Tyler,” Kym said.She spent the spring fretting about Ryan’s college decision, wondering whether she would be able to set foot in the same stadiums Tyler played in if Ryan stayed on the West Coast. She and Mark worried even more about whether they could bear sending him more than a short drive away. Most of all, everyone worries whenever Ryan gets hit in a game, none more than when he was concussed in his final high school game. They wonder what those hits could mean now and what they could mean in the future.“If anyone says they’re not, then they’re lying,” Kelly said. “Because every time I hear a smack or see him go down at all, I hold my breath just a little bit. My heart skips.”Ryan said he thinks about C.T.E. in relation to other players more than himself, but he remains wary and knows the risk of a brain injury.“It's one of those things I don't really think about too much during the game,” he said. “I would know, because I got hit last year and everything was blurry and I was like 'Oh man.' I took myself out of the game and said 'Hey, you need to put somebody else in there.' There's definitely a line. If it goes too far, I've got to stop. I won't be some guy out there who doesn't know what sideline to go to.”When Ryan finally decided on a college, he made an unusual choice: He would play for the South Carolina Gamecocks, a middling Southeastern Conference team that had not signed a player out of California since 2015.He said “a big factor” in his decision was to give everyone the hope of a new beginning an entire coast away from heartbreak. Kelly is relocating from Utah and intends to enroll in South Carolina’s medical school. Mark and Kym bought a home in Lake Murray, about 30 minutes from campus. They will settle in sometime this spring.“It would be hard not to be together knowing that we weren’t in Pullman,” Mark said.“And maybe that could have made some kind of difference,” Kym added, completing his sentence.Ryan elected to graduate a semester early, so he will be in South Carolina in a matter of weeks. He adores the food — the fried chicken chain Bojangles’ is a particular favorite — and he is excited to join a new church. He is also looking forward to going home to a new place on the weekends, and doing his part to help the family build their new life. They are planning to adopt a dog and name it Sweet Tea. He has heard plenty about Southern hospitality, and wonders how friendly the new neighbors will be.“I feel like in movies in the South, they’ll come and knock on the door and give you pecan pie,” he said. “I think that’ll be cool.”He is eager to be unpacked. He still carries so much with him."
"When Leslie Smith, a high school senior from Miami, made his official visit to the University of Pittsburgh last month, he got an idea before a photo shoot in which he was to pose wearing the Panthers’ football uniform.He asked his mother, Lucretia Chapple, who was accompanying him on his visit, to put on the jersey.His request was too mild for her.“She decided, ‘I’m going to put on the whole uniform,’” Smith said.The result is a pair of pictures of Smith, who will suit up for Pitt more regularly next season as a freshman linebacker, and Chapple, who in years past played basketball and ran track. Both are clad in the school’s blue and gold colors, head to almost-toe (they did not appear to have cleats that fit Chapple). Long hair flows from the back of her helmet.“She looks pretty good in that uniform,” said Smith’s future coach, Pat Narduzzi. “She looks like a player.”Parents of college-age students have long proudly advertised where their students attend school on sweatshirts, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, etc.But football parents — a special species of sports parent — have a new twist on that this year. As national signing day dawns Wednesday, the trend du jour is parents dressing up in uniforms alongside their talented sons.The resulting shots are, of course, posted to Twitter and Instagram, from which they ricochet across the web.“I had buddies coming up to me being like, ‘You know you’re on Barstool Sports?’” said Steve Snyder, who posed alongside his son, Sam, a tight end, during Sam’s official visit to Missouri.There may be no bigger date on the calendar for college football teams than signing day, since personnel overwhelmingly dictates a team’s ultimate success or failure. For the past two years, players have also been able to sign during a brief window in December, as Smith did, but signing day is still when ultimate judgment about coaches’ recruiting is rendered.“For college football, recruiting is the lifeblood,” said Luke Stampini, a recruiting analyst at 247Sports. “If you’re not recruiting well, you’re probably not going to be around for long.”The uniform photo-op arguably reflects broader currents in child rearing. It could be cast as helicopter-parenting — or perhaps the next generation of helicopter-parenting, in which the parent ropes down from the chopper right after his child.“This is the era of ‘we’ parenting, i.e., ‘We have a midterm. We’ve got a game tomorrow. We’re being recruited by top-tier schools,’” Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former Stanford administrator and the author of “How to Raise an Adult,” said in an email.“If the child is wearing a jersey signaling their recruitment status, the we-speaking parent wants that cool jersey, too,” she said, adding, “But where does this intertwined-ness stop?”What the novelty undeniably reveals is a crucial secret to recruiting nowadays. For all the talk that prognosticators may offer about how well a certain linebacker meshes with a certain coordinator’s defensive philosophy or how successful a college program is at developing players for the N.F.L., much of recruiting comes down to the more basic element of feel. Even for top football players, college football is also college, and that means getting the family to sign on, too.“The recruiting process is not just about the player. They can’t recruit the player. They’ve got to recruit the family,” said Jamal Hill, who posed alongside his older brother, Jeffrey, who got to wear Oregon’s neon green uniform as opposed to Jamal’s black one.“It’s a long-term decision,” Hill added. “You’ve got to trust them. Once you start recruiting the whole family, that makes it go more smoothly.”During their campus visits, recruits typically tour not only football facilities but academic ones. Coaches are as likely to shoot the breeze as to draw Xs and Os on a whiteboard, hoping to make recruits — and their families — feel like their college is a suitable home-away-from-home.Steve Ognenovic — whose son Nikolas, a tight end, posed alongside his father at Pitt and Kentucky before signing with the latter — recalled a long visit with Auburn Coach Gus Malzahn. “We spent 20 minutes talking about football,” Ognenovic said. “The rest was about the new addition on his deck, the truck he bought. He’s a regular guy.”The trend can also be a way for coaches to signal to recruits, present and future, what kind of program they are running. For instance, Florida’s second-year head coach, Dan Mullen, appears intent on reintroducing to Gainesville the kind of whimsy one expects from a team whose fans do a gator-chop on game days.In contrast, a Tennessee assistant coach recently spoke out against the practice, tweeting that one of the things he prays for was “that I NEVER have to outfit someone’s dad in full gear for a photo shoot.” It is not shocking that the assistant first worked with Tennessee’s head coach, Jeremy Pruitt, when both were on the staff of Alabama’s supremely buttoned-up Nick Saban, whose recruits are probably less likely to pose alongside mom or dad.So why do some kids and parents want these photographs, which may be compelling but are also a little bit absurd? And why do they make heavy rotation on social media and in the sports blogosphere?The photos are a reminder of the human dimension in college football’s annual meat market. For all the hoopla over which program has signed the best class (spoiler: yet again, it will probably be Alabama) and which team whiffed on a prized in-state offensive lineman, often overlooked is how big a day this is for the prospects themselves, who, like so many other adolescents who are less gifted on the gridiron, are finally completing the large and much-celebrated process of deciding where to go to college.Steve Snyder said that, when a Missouri coach asked if he wanted to put a jersey on, “I thought to myself, how many opportunities am I ever going to get to have an experience like this with my son?”His son ended up signing with Baylor, and, Snyder said, friends and family had already loaded up on Bears gear. “You’re very proud parents,” he said. “Lot of hard work.”"
"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — If the businessmen had taken an unimpassioned look at the financial fundamentals of the football program at the University of Alabama atBirmingham on a late May day in 2015, they would have left it in the dustbin.Six months earlier, the president of the university, Dr. Ray Watts, had shut down the debt-ridden program. Now, 25 of the region’s business moguls were gathered on the 14th floor of the university’s administration building with Watts. They did what they were not expected to do, pledging $5.2 million to help bring back the program.“It was not a U.A.B. thing, it was a Birmingham thing,” said Hatton Smith, a Birmingham native and one of the businessmen in the room.Now look at U.A.B. football, and Birmingham. In an era when there are routine calls to dismantle expensive, money-losing college football programs and high school students are shying from the game over concerns about safety, the U.A.B. story is the ultimate unicorn. It fits no larger trend, other than football remaining very popular in the South. Still, it is entirely possible this would not have happened at any other university with U.A.B.’s fact pattern.The Blazers returned to action in 2017, going 8-5 and losing to Ohio University in the Bahamas Bowl. They are 10-3 this season, winning Conference USA, and will play Northern Illinois in the Boca Raton Bowl on Tuesday. The Blazers’ coach, Bill Clark, has been offered a five-year contract that will make him the conference’s highest-paid coach. There were 1,400 season-ticket holders when the program folded. There are now 14,000.Where game day around U.A.B. football in 2014 could be humdrum, the scene around Legion Field in 2018 is a sea of green and gold tents for euphoric tailgaters and food trucks galore scattered among revelers. Judges patrol the tailgate area to award prizes for decorations. Players walk through the backslapping throng on their way into the stadium on Blazer Walk.Many of the business leaders in the May 2015 meeting also donated to build a state-of-the-art $22.5 million football headquarters and practice facility. The momentum spurred a joint venture of the university, the City of Birmingham, Jefferson County and the state’s legislature to build a $174 million, 45,000-seat stadium, which is expected to be ready for the 2021 season. It will replace 91-year-old Legion Field.David Ridpath, a sports management associate professor at Ohio who studies college athletics, has wondered since 2015 if Watts made a calculated gamble and won big because of the business community and Birmingham’s pride.“Sometimes saying you are going to drop a sport is the best marketing tool that you have, the scorched-earth strategy,” Ridpath said. “If Watts didn’t plan this, it sure as heck turned out to be a pretty happy accident for people who wanted to save the program. Now they have much more than they would have had before if they had just kept the program.”Given the upside-down story of U.A.B., it figures that the Blazers led Conference USA in scoring defense (17.3 points a game) yet did not have a player named to the league’s first-team defense. The sophomore running back Spencer Brown was a star with 1,149 yards rushing, but many accept that the real star is Clark, the Eddie Robinson National Coach of the Year. He was the coach when the program folded in 2014, and he revived it by furiously recruiting junior college players for immediate help.Smith said many saw the shuttering of U.A.B. football as another failure for Birmingham. The city has scrubbed at the permanent stain left by menacing police dogs and fire hoses turned on civil rights protesters in the 1960s and the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, which killed four girls. Birmingham, once on par with Nashville and Atlanta, fell far behind its rivals in size and economic development.“The city has had a crisis of self-confidence, so the loss of U.A.B. football added to that,” said Smith, 68. “We had a failed football program in the heartland of football fever. It was a total slap in the face of Birmingham. We can do better than run a white flag up.”Birmingham certainly has problems that a college football program cannot fix. The poverty rate is 28.1 percent compared with 12.3 over all in the United States, according to 2017 Census Bureau data. A 2017 school board candidate’s website deplored the statistic that just 8.2 percent of the city’s eighth graders were proficient in reading and math.Watts made it clear in the months after his decision that if sufficient money was raised, he would consider restoring the program, which began in 1991 as part of N.C.A.A. Division III. Watts said he heard the doubts about the validity of a report he used as evidence to shut down the program, so he commissioned a second report, which he said cost U.A.B. about $75,000.“It essentially said the same thing,” Watts said in defending his initial decision.Still, Watts left the door open, and the community barged through.In the first five months of 2015, there was a groundswell of support from alumni and businesses that raised $12 million. That included 84 percent of the 18,000-undergraduate student body voting to raise student fees by $25 a semester.It was not enough, Watts said.Then came the meeting on May 27 and the additional $5.2 million pledged from the business leaders. The accumulated $17.2 million wiped away what Watts said was the athletic department’s operational debt to the university. It put pressure on Watts to restore the football program, which he did June 1, just ahead of a Conference USA deadline that requires its Division I members to have football.Watts said the administration was still the biggest funder of athletics. It provides a $20 million subsidy for an athletics budget of about $30 million. Watts, who graduated from the university in 1976 with an engineering degree, oversees a $1.2 billion campus budget, $3 billion when the U.A.B. health system is included, but he is still not willing to allow football to skate free of debt.The sardonic view is the football fanatics got their team back and the party lights are back on. But in the May 2015 fund-raising meeting, Mike Goodrich, Sr., founder of an engineering and construction company, hushed an animated debate when he stood and said: “You know I’m not a sports fan. I don’t think I’ve been to a U.A.B. football game, but I’ve seen what this has done to our community. I’m in for a million.”“It was a huge moment,” said Mark Ingram, who had become the U.A.B. athletic director just nine days earlier. “Then somebody else says, ‘I can do that’. Then somebody else says ‘I don’t know if I can do a million, but I can do $500,000’. Then somebody else says ‘I can do $250,000.’ ”Many of the millionaires in the meeting with Watts did not attend U.A.B. They were graduates of Auburn, Alabama, Trinity, Birmingham-Southern, Washington & Lee, among others.Ingram played football at the University of Tennessee, where old money, he said, helps makes sure the Vols want for nothing. U.A.B. is just 50 years old, he said, and it does not yet have the legacy families to write checks in times of need.The Birmingham executives decided to try to fill the need. Jimmy Filler, who made his fortune in recycling and attended Samford University in Birmingham, donated $1 million to the new football operations center.Ingram is overseeing a renaissance of U.A.B. athletics on the west side of downtown, which includes a new beach volleyball facility and track, an expanded soccer facility and new women’s basketball locker rooms. He said the athletics department had raised $60 million since June 1, 2015.“It’s a classic case of ‘you don’t know what you got until it’s gone,’ ” he said.For Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham, the story of U.A.B. football is one of redemption — on the football field and off. “What you are seeing in our city is a resurgence,” he said."
"As a child, Michael Thomas never had a visit from an N.F.L. player in his classroom. That is what he was saying recently to a group of seventh graders at the Eagle Academy for Young Men, in West Harlem. He was asked to be there for an hour. He stayed for two.He departed with a message. “Leadership comes with a lot of responsibility,” he told the students. “People look at you differently. They hold you to a higher standard.”A few minutes later, walking down the hallway, he passed a mural of Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists at the 1968 Summer Olympics.“There it is,” the Giants defensive back and special teams player said quietly.Two years ago, Thomas started kneeling on the sidelines during the national anthem, as a member of the Miami Dolphins, to protest police brutality, racism and inequality. Since then, he has been consumed by one word: sustainability, which is to say, promoting the changes that he and his fellow protesters had been pressing for, like criminal justice reform.Thomas is no longer kneeling, and he is trying to thread a small needle: He wants to squelch the critics who say the N.F.L. kneelers are not doing anything productive while making sure those who supported his on-field protests do not view him as backing down in the face of pressure from league executives and even the White House.As part of his continuing education, Thomas, a Houston native, spent three weeks during the off-season as an intern in the office of a Texas congresswoman, Sheila Jackson Lee, learning how to take activism and turn it into law. He also has been named to the N.F.L. Players Association’s 12-member executive committee, a position he feels requires him to represent all players.“I’m doing everything I can in my power, while I have a platform and a voice, to try to make change,” Thomas said. “That’s it.”Thomas has not committed to standing, or kneeling, in the future; an attempt at changing the league’s rules on the protests has been delayed. Los Angeles Chargers offensive lineman Russell Okung, a fellow member of the executive committee, has continued raising a fist, but Thomas said his method of on-field protest would be kneeling only.“It’s the most powerful thing to do,” he said.This winter, Thomas, who led the league in special-teams tackles last season, waited and watched as other, similar players received lucrative contracts. Concerned that his outspokenness might have cost him a future in the league — his friend Eric Reid, a Colin Kaepernick ally, did not sign a contract until this week — Thomas began making preparations to attend law school. (The Giants eventually offered him a two-year deal worth $4 million, although the team can cut him in 2019 without a salary-cap hit.)Thomas grew emotional last season when speaking to reporters after President Trump’s disparaging remarks about N.F.L. players’ protests at a rally in Alabama.Two years ago, Thomas had no clue where the protests would lead. He acted in college at Stanford. The son of two lawyers, he said he loved football enough to think he might pursue a career in coaching. But his off-the-field activism — and the three weeks on Capitol Hill — have widened his outlook. Now, he said, he has considered a run for political office one day.“I’d vote for him,” said Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh, who coached Thomas at Stanford.To most fans, Thomas’s career was born in the fourth quarter of a game on Dec. 15, 2013, when he intercepted New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the end zone, sealing a Dolphins victory.Undrafted out of college, Thomas had been on the practice squad with the San Francisco 49ers the previous week. Despite his positive outlook, he was languishing. But with injuries in their secondary, the Dolphins called his agent, Christina Phillips, to see if they could add him to their active roster immediately.The Dolphins quickly learned what Harbaugh already knew: It is beneficial having Michael Thomas around.“There’s a huge difference in all the locker rooms I’ve ever been in when Michael Thomas is in the locker room versus when he is not,” Harbaugh said.Born in Jeanerette, La., Thomas moved to Houston in 1998 with his parents, both graduates of Southern University, when his eldest sister needed treatment for Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer. By 2001, her cancer was in remission, and Thomas was on his way to football stardom as an option quarterback at Nimitz High School. Undersized but athletic, he attracted interest from colleges as a defensive player.“I don’t care about my size,” said Thomas, who is 5 feet 11 inches and 180 pounds. “I can match up with any tight end or wide receiver, because I’m going to be smart about it.”Thomas was a defensive captain in college and with the Dolphins. At Stanford, his teammates went to see him play Joe Cooper in a student production of “Killer Joe,” a dark Tracy Letts comedy about a hit man.“When he talked, you listened, and you respected what he was voicing,” said Jets defensive lineman Henry Anderson, who played with Thomas at Stanford.The deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, shot by police officers a day apart in July 2016, prompted Thomas and three of his Dolphins teammates — Kenny Stills, Arian Foster and Jelani Jenkins — to kneel during the anthem at the start of the 2016 season. Thomas said he had spoken with Kaepernick, the former 49ers quarterback, about his decision.“I was done with talking about it, hashtag, social media,” Thomas said. “It was time to let people know it ain’t ‘all good.’ Something’s got to be done.”Behind the scenes, Thomas also conferred with the Dolphins’ owner, Stephen Ross, who gave the protesting players his blessing. Thomas was asked to support Ross’s initiatives to improve race relations, and he agreed.Thomas also got involved in a Miami-area community effort called First Step, which sought to bridge the divide between law enforcement personnel and underprivileged neighborhoods in areas like Fort Pierce, Fla. He rode to an event in a St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office helicopter.Then an opportunity arose through the players association to complete an externship with a sitting member of Congress. Thomas jumped at it.“We’re doing what we can as players to use our voice and our platform,” Thomas said. “But this is how the rest of the U.S. creates change. So, O.K., let me learn that game, too.”In the office of Jackson Lee, who has represented Thomas’s Houston district since 1995, he answered phones and handled paperwork. President Trump had just released his budget requests, so Thomas got to sit in on the Democratic budget meeting.“The next day, I’m in the meeting with Democrats and Republicans going at it,” Thomas said. “They’re letting the White House representative have it. I’m like, ‘This is the real deal.’”Thomas said Jackson Lee had encouraged him to keep pushing the envelope and fighting for change. He has been invited back to speak to the Congressional Black Caucus, but for the fall at least, his schedule is a bit tight.“I could see myself in that space,” Thomas said. “And it’s much needed with these perspectives. Taking on the role, which I was voted into, with the N.F.L.P.A., just understanding we need different perspectives, different voices. The time is now for it.”"
"In the N.F.L., where the wait between most games is a long, charged week, tales of eccentric pregame rituals in the final jittery moments before kickoff have become a fabled part of the sport’s lore.If, for example, a team is on a win streak, superstitious players might make sure to put on their uniforms exactly as they had in previous weeks: left sock first, then the right sock; left pant leg before the right pant leg, and so on.Or, a motivational sign above the locker room door could be considered a good-luck charm and be tapped, or slapped, as everyone exits the room. A team might also file onto the field in the same numerical order week after week — all in the search of positive juju.But this is the modern N.F.L., a multibillion dollar enterprise celebrating its centennial next season. Surely, mystical rituals are abating in the analytics era, right?In fact, they are as entrenched as the laces on the football. At best, they are evolving.Philadelphia center Jason Kelce, for instance, likes to listen to Christmas music before games, even in September.Why?“To take the seriousness out of things,” Kelce said. “I want to hear something happy. It lets me go back to childhood memories — happy times.”Kelce did concede he is listening to less pregame music in an effort to cut back on certain repetitive behaviors, although maybe not for the most obvious reasons.“My wife is superstitious enough for both of us,” Kelce said with a laugh. “If we win a game, she’ll do everything the same that she did the week before. Same routine in the morning at home as the week before. Drive the same route to the stadium as the last week. The whole thing.”Giants quarterback Eli Manning at first insisted he had no special pregame ritual. Then he remembered the T-shirt he wears under his equipment. During each of the 16 regular season games, Manning wears the same T-shirt. (It is laundered after each game.)During the preseason, Manning carefully picks out the T-shirt — from dozens of candidates — that will be his “gamer” undergarment.“I get that one ready early, just get the sleeves cut to the length I want and just make sure it’s comfortable and I’m good with it in all kinds of different ways,” Manning said as if he were explaining how he chose which house to buy and live in. “Then that T-shirt is on the loop going forward. All 16 games.”He added: “But I don’t really have any superstitions.”Some players openly acknowledge their devotion to elaborate pregame rituals, including the time-consuming, pedantic left sock/right sock progression that is apparently still in vogue.“Those kinds of rituals are still very common,” said Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie, who like Manning is a 15-year veteran of the N.F.L. “How can you ignore it? Obviously, we’re all professionals and work hard to develop certain skills, but the game is played with a funny shaped ball that takes crazy bounces. All of the athleticism in the world can’t and won’t control those bounces.“So you’re figuratively praying to the football gods, hoping they’ll be on your side that day.”On the other hand, Washington kicker Dustin Hopkins willfully keeps a higher power in mind before games for a different goal. On arrival at the stadium, Hopkins gets adjusted by a chiropractor. He then has the strength and conditioning coach use a rolling pin-like device to loosen his muscles and then takes a shower to make sure he is, as he said, “awake.”Hopkins is also persnickety about double-checking that every helmet chin strap or shoe string is not worn or frayed. He jogs onto the field and warms up with about 30 kicks.And during that entire time — from chiropractor to field goal attempts — he is praying. Among other things, Hopkins prays for the safety of his teammates, his opponents and himself.The veteran Baltimore safety Eric Weddle, meanwhile, is purposefully trying to avoid a different longstanding pregame ritual — the on-field scrum where players jump up and down in a circle and ceremoniously, usually violently, bang into each other.“That’s one of those pregame football things where guys like to butt heads or slap a helmet, but I hate when people hit my helmet,” Weddle said. “I tell them to get away from me.“It’s a ritual but guys know to keep me out of it. If a rookie or a new guy hits my helmet, I tell them right away: ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ I don’t need to get psyched up for the game; I’m already pretty motivated.”Some players’ rituals are pretty straight forward. Before every game, Giants linebacker Alec Ogletree makes sure he munches from a bag of Twizzlers — and only Twizzlers, not some other licorice. Several hours before every game when the grandstands are empty, Washington wide receiver Jamison Crowder methodically walks the length of the stadium field by himself twice. He then sprints across it twice. The goal, he said, is to feel the karma of the place.“Each field and every stadium has its own feel but you’ll never grasp it when the place is full and 70,000 people are screaming at you,” Crowder said. “You have to go out when it’s quiet. Just you and the field.”Baltimore receiver Willie Snead does something almost transcendental as well, carefully making his way around the entire field. It is a ritual he learned from Jerry Rice, who holds most of the league’s pass-catching records.“He went onto the field and visualized himself making plays while running certain pass routes,” Snead said of Rice. “It makes you comfortable in the environment.”There are, however, some players who swear off a pregame routine of any kind.“I’m afraid a pregame ritual could add to the anxiety of the moment,” Redskins defensive end Ryan Kerrigan said. “What if I decided to eat a certain food before every game but one week we’re in Philadelphia and they don’t have that food? What would I do then? I’d be more stressed.”But faith in superstitious customs, something observed in civilizations for many centuries, has a powerful allure. Even the N.F.L.’s game officials are not immune to its pull.Gene Steratore, a longtime referee until his retirement this season, said that a crew of officials will always dress in the same lockers they used the last time they were assigned to work at that stadium.“It’s amazing, because you might not have been in that stadium for a while, but we wouldn’t dare change our habits,” said Steratore, who is now a CBS rules analyst.Steratore recalled that one year at Foxboro Stadium in New England, a new attendant was assigned to the officials’ locker room.“Before we got there, the attendant put name tags on the lockers for the crew,” Steratore said. “We pulled all the tags off the tops of the lockers and arranged them so we were dressing where we always dressed.”But Joe Theismann, the former Washington quarterback and the N.F.L.’s most valuable player in the 1983 season, said that he believes the N.F.L.’s ritualistic habits, while still patently evident, have ebbed slightly. The players of his era, Theismann insisted, were obsessed with pregame rituals and how they could influence the outcome of games.“Everybody had something they did because it’s a way to get ready for the game,” said Theismann, who played in the N.F.L. for 12 years. “I was probably the most superstitious.”Early in his career, Theismann played well after having eaten a banana split the night before the game. For more than 150 N.F.L. games thereafter, he insisted on having a banana split the evening before any contest, even if meant going into hotel kitchens and making the dessert himself.On game days, he also had a meticulous routine for putting on his uniform, and he would then lie on a bed of towels he constructed in front of his locker, where he would always read People Magazine cover to cover.He altered his ritual only once as a pro, in 1985.“We had a Redskins logo near the locker room door and for 12 years on the way out I hit that logo for good luck and never said a word,” Theismann said. “But on the night I got hurt, I hit that logo — and probably because we in the midst of a lousy season — I said: ‘Tonight, your life’s going to change.’ ”In the game that night against the Giants, Theismann broke his leg in two places. He never played football again.“It’s interesting to think about it now,” Theismann said. “Changed the routine and my life really did change completely.”"
"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — In the beginning, there was Notre Dame Stadium, the House That Rockne Built, a concrete cathedral cradling a proud football program with seven national college football championships. Later, Touchdown Jesus appeared, watching over the Fighting Irish and their home field as Notre Dame went on to claim four more national titles.And for decades, those few acres on campus were, at least in the eyes of Notre Dame fans, sacred ground.But progress waits for no one, not even Notre Dame. In October, Garth Brooks performed a concert inside the House That Rockne Built, a first for the stadium. And next week, two N.H.L. teams will play an outdoor hockey game on a rink installed atop its famed field.Just as Knute Rockne’s years as coach catapulted Notre Dame into the nation’s consciousness and the “Word of Life” mural — Touchdown Jesus’s formal name — offered the university a singular television backdrop, the Brooks concert and the hockey game have announced a new direction for an old-school athletic program.Having completed a nine-figure makeover of the stadium and its surrounding environs, and facing a financial landscape in college football that threatens to leave the Fighting Irish behind, Notre Dame is now ready to leverage, very carefully, one of its most valuable assets: a mystique it has spent more than a century cultivating.Brooks, the country music star, was the perfect match for the stadium’s debut as a prestige entertainment site. He has a wide following and a wholesome image, and he even claimed to have had a poster of the former Fighting Irish quarterback Joe Montana in his dorm room at Oklahoma State. This month, his concert was broadcast on network television on the same day that the Fighting Irish (12-0) earned a spot in the College Football Playoff. Notre Dame will face Clemson (13-0) in the first semifinal, at the Cotton Bowl on Saturday.A few days later, on New Year’s Day, the N.H.L.’s annual open-air Winter Classic game will be held at Notre Dame Stadium. Coming soon, perhaps, will be a summer soccer match featuring two of Europe’s marquee clubs.Will modernizing its athletic business plan help deliver a 12th national title? Not even Notre Dame can guarantee that. But a willingness to embrace a new financial strategy, university officials said, is vital in helping Notre Dame keep up in the increasingly rich world of college athletics.The retrofitting of Notre Dame Stadium was just the first step. After years of pushback from tradition-loving alumni, the stadium now has new premium seating, event spaces and even a five-story video board. To get those amenities — now standard for almost every major college football stadium — roughly two-thirds of the $400 million set aside for the university’s construction project was first spent on classrooms and facilities for the music, anthropology and psychology departments, as well as state-of-the-art student recreation and multimedia centers.“Everything we do here is threading that needle of: How can athletics do what it needs to do to compete, but also serve the broader community?” Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick said. “It’s an interesting balance, and what dictates our ability to do any of it depends on those cultural underpinnings.”Swarbrick knows better than most how expensive it is to keep up with the Alabamas, the Oklahomas and the other universities in the so-called Power Five conferences, with their billion-dollar television contracts and — in the case of the Big Ten, the Southeastern Conference and the Pacific-12 — their own cash-generating television networks. In addition, most of the Power Five universities have significantly larger enrollments than Notre Dame has; that produces vast alumni bases that can earmark tens of millions of dollars in donations to their sports teams, widening an already sizable wealth gap in college sports.There was a time when Notre Dame’s tradition produced structural advantages of its own. Notre Dame’s contract with NBC Sports to televise its home games used to be the envy of college football, allowing the university to remain an independent and free from the constraints of a conference schedule. But the reported $16 million annually it received looks quaint amid today’s economics.Now, the football program is Notre Dame’s only sport that consistently makes money, but that revenue — a tiny part of an operating budget of more than $1.4 billion — goes to a general fund that nonathletic officials allocate.Embracing the financial realities of modern college football — multimillion-dollar salaries for assistant coaches, luxury suites for top donors and corporate sponsorships to pay for it all — has been part of Notre Dame’s fiscal awakening. But it is also at the heart of its new push to monetize one of America’s most iconic brands in ways that once might have been unthinkable.Among the upgrades at Notre Dame Stadium, for example, is a ballroom overlooking the field that can host events like weddings and banquets — except, of course, on game days, when the stadium retains its tradition-thick vibe, a throwback to college football’s leather helmet era. On game day afternoons, only game highlights are allowed on the video board, and there are still no sponsor signs in sight.All that purity is great for aesthetics, but it can be tough on the bottom line.Inside Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium, by contrast, national sponsors pay $80,000 to have their logos rotate on the scoreboard during Crimson Tide football games and more than $100,000 to place their names on the tunnels and corner boards. Anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000 buys one minute of pregame advertising and two minutes of in-game ads on the LED scroll, a direct pitch to the crowds that regularly exceed 100,000.In Tuscaloosa, where dozens of companies are eager to be part of Alabama football, that Saturday-only revenue can surpass $5 million a game in a hurry.But Ryan Brewer, an assistant professor of finance at Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus, said the Fighting Irish’s restraint and commitment to the past had paid off. Brewer analyzes a variety of factors to determine what college teams would be worth on the open market if they could be bought and sold like professional franchises.In his most recent valuations, Notre Dame’s price tag was $856 million, good enough to be ranked No. 7. Ohio State topped his list, at $1.5 billion, trailed by Texas and two of the teams in this year’s College Football Playoff, Alabama and Oklahoma.“Notre Dame football has a mystique that they developed through success in the beginning and continues to inspire respect,” Brewer said, “and part of that is their fundamental alignment with the academic side of the house.”For much of its history, Notre Dame was considered a true national university and a prime destination for blue-chip football players. Today, enormous recruiting budgets, private planes and social media make it easy for Alabama, Oklahoma and Clemson to seek out prospects anywhere. Big media deals mean live telecasts and streams of nearly every game in tens of millions of households on network television, cable TV and conference-owned networks.The Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dame’s president, acknowledged that most people still view his university as a football powerhouse rather than academic one. But he has been among the most vocal opponents of proposals to abandon the amateur model in college athletics for a semiprofessional structure in which universities would pay their athletes. He said Notre Dame would leave the N.C.A.A. if that day came.“Our relationship to these young people is to educate them, to help them grow,” he told The Times. “Not to be their agent for financial gain.”To that end, athletes at Notre Dame abide by some old-school customs: Athletes must live on campus for three years alongside their classmates, instead of in segregated dormitories as is common elsewhere. They are expected to be solid students as well, and according to at least one nationwide metric, they have been: In each of the past 13 years, Notre Dame has had either the most or the second-most teams with perfect scores in the N.C.A.A.’s annual set of academic progress rate statistics.Still, Notre Dame must compete in a college football marketplace in which universities from Oregon to Florida, all of them flush with television riches through their conferences, are erecting multimillion-dollar weight rooms, practice sites and academic centers to attract the finest players in the country.“You can look around the college landscape, and it’s happening everywhere,” said Bob Vecchione, the executive director of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. “Everyone is trying to raise the student-athlete experience. It is expensive, and it works. Just look at the facilities the four teams in the playoffs have. That’s the bar.”There is no substitute for winning, though. Notre Dame’s last national championship came in 1988. In 2012, the Irish went undefeated and reached the national championship game opposite a one-loss Alabama team. The Irish lost, 42-14.Whether or not another title is at hand, it is important for the Fighting Irish that they at least remain in the hunt — and do so without devaluing what the university holds most dear. For Swarbrick, all of those imperatives — on-field success, financial reality and high academic standards — can coexist without abandoning a culture that values tradition over revenue.“First and most important, it offers a rebuttal a growing chorus of people who say we can’t do things the way we do and be successful,” he said. “We can and we will continue to do so.”"
"Football coaches across New Jersey, which has packed lineups with N.F.L. stars for decades, are asking the same question this fall: Where have all the players gone?Rich Hansen, the football coach and athletic director for 31 years at perennial power St. Peter’s Prep in Jersey City, began listing off the schools he knew of that had struggled to field a team in a state that has long been a college recruiting hotbed.“Glen Ridge, Marist, Montclair Immaculate, Montclair Kimberley, Morris Catholic, Dickinson — it’s an epidemic,” Hansen said. The latest active participation numbers, which were released in August, showed a drastic statewide decline for the second consecutive year: The 2017 high school football season featured nearly 1,700 fewer players than the year before, a downturn of 6.8 percent. Only three other states, Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma, had steeper drops.The primary reason New Jersey’s proud high school football tradition is plunging toward irrelevancy is the growing concern about head injuries, many coaches and administrators said. That aligns with national data collected by Roger Pielke Jr., director of the Sports Governance Center at the University of Colorado, who has been studying the decline in football participation.Football remains the nation’s most popular sport for boys ages 14 to 17. But since 2009, when a record 1.14 million athletes participated in 11-player high school football, interest has fallen. The sport drew 1.03 million participants in 2017. Though Pielke is careful about ascribing direct causation, he notes that the biggest drops occurred after the 2012 suicide of Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau (who was later found to have C.T.E., the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head) and the release of the movie “Concussion” in 2015.“You always want to be careful calling something a ‘peak,’” Pielke said. “But it is robust enough now that I’m writing up all this data.”Mike Warnock, the head football coach and a math teacher at Metuchen High School, does not need national numbers to understand what is happening at his school. Metuchen recently forfeited a game for the first time in its program’s nine-decade history. The reason? Not enough players.In his math class for the past 16 years, Warnock has handed out a questionnaire at the start of the school year to try to learn more about his students’ interests. Now he studies those forms, tracks down students who are not playing sports and pitches them on high school football.“I’m like, ‘Hey, you don’t play any sports in the fall,’” Warnock said. “‘You can play football. What’s keeping you from playing?’”The drop in football participation in New Jersey last year was far greater than for other sports. Girls’ soccer had the second-biggest decline, losing 577 players from 2016 to 2017, or 3.8 percent. Boys’ soccer participation dropped by 979 players, or 0.6 percent. It appears the outlook for football is even bleaker in 2018. Multiple schools, including Roselle Park, a three-time section state champion, recently suspended their programs or dropped down to a junior varsity schedule because of low turnout. Others, like Metuchen, were barely hanging on.“The numbers don’t lie,” said Ken Mason, athletic director at West Windsor-Plainsboro, whose two high schools, North and South, merged football teams this season to account for a decline in players.“Since we’ve done it,” Mason added, “I’ve gotten a million phone calls asking how.”In interviews, coaches and administrators across the state largely agreed about causes, but they had few solutions. Town demographics are changing, they said, and students’ interests are shifting toward activities like soccer and basketball, the fastest-growing sport in the state. Others point to the increasingly year-round demands of football, which cut deeper and deeper into summer vacation.But safety concerns remain the primary cause of the shift, coaches said. Pielke said New Jersey’s statistics jumped out at him, in part because of its history as one of the Northeast’s gridiron strongholds.Joe Theismann played football in the state, as did Franco Harris, Bill Parcells and Victor Cruz. Minkah Fitzpatrick, the No. 11 pick in the 2018 N.F.L. draft, hailed from Old Bridge. Tom Lemming, a football recruiting analyst for CBS Sports Network, puts New Jersey’s Catholic schools at the top in the nation as feeders for programs like Alabama, Michigan, Penn State and Notre Dame. New Jersey is also the first state in the nation to begin using video review extensively, even in regular-season games.But there has been an erosion of players at the smaller schools, particularly ones that populate Group I and Group II — the smallest schools — in the state’s athletics classification system. That includes Metuchen.The trend has drawn enough concern that the North Jersey Super Football Conference, a 115-team megaleague formed in 2016, is discussing creating a developmental division for schools struggling to field a team, affording them a less competitive schedule as they rebuild, according to Hansen, a conference vice president.He said he was also in favor of restricting off-season activity for teams that now routinely meet throughout the summer, which drains vacation time for students and families.“Football is no longer just mid-August through late October,” said Ryan Horan, the athletic director at Immaculate Conception High School in Montclair. Though football was the only sport offered to boys in the fall, the team was down to 16 players four years ago. Horan said that the program had since bounced back to 40 players this year, but it had taken great effort. “It’s sadly become almost year-round,” he said of the sport.He recalled pleading with a parent to let her son play, even as she worried about head injuries. Horan eventually convinced her that playing football would help him improve at his better sport, track. “If I can win over the mother,” he said, “it’s pretty easy after that.”Efforts to make football safer and more inviting include less hitting in practices and the use of soft-shell helmet covers called Guardian Caps, which are intended to decrease the risk of head injuries. Yet despite those changes, coaches like Warnock are still devoting considerable energy to maintaining or expanding rosters.A week into the season, Metuchen’s longtime rival, Highland Park, forfeited the remainder of its games, including the annual Thanksgiving Day game against Warnock’s Bulldogs. He noted that Highland Park folded with 19 players on its roster; his team has only a handful more.“We’re not walking away,” Warnock said. He told his players “we’re not going to do that. Everybody needs to step up and contribute.”Three days after the forfeit, Vincent Caputo, the superintendent of the Metuchen School District, tried to dismiss the school’s struggle, suggesting the team had been unlucky with injuries.“I’m not sure it’s a thing,” Caputo said. “It might be just a couple years.”Others were less sure. Bruce Peragallo, the principal at Metuchen High School, was an assistant coach for the football team in the late 1980s. In those days, he said, the town had a special connection with football, which won a state section title in 1985. Even a few years ago, the football team had 55 members. Today, the local flag football program is thriving, with about 300 members, while the high school team drops games. “It never crossed my mind then that we would ever not have enough kids to play a game,” Peragallo said. “But it’s a different time.”A week earlier, the Bulldogs’ roster had been reduced to 17 active players after three were injured in a game, including one player who was whisked away in an ambulance. That prompted the principal to huddle with his superintendent over the weekend to discuss whether playing another game with such a short roster was a responsible thing to do.“We talked three or four times,” Caputo said. “He finally called me Sunday and said, ‘I hate to do it, it’s my last choice, but I want to cancel the game.’”Metuchen’s athletic director, John Cathcart, was so taken aback by the request that he had to look up the forfeiting procedures.“I didn’t even know how to do it,” Cathcart said. “It just never really occurred to me that this would ever happen to us.”Warnock signed up four freshmen the next week right from the hallways. He has tried to maintain a sense of humor in his second season as coach.“I can talk anytime,” he said as he jogged out to a sparsely filled field, “except when I need to play offensive line.”"
"Something was wrong. He could sense it.The feeling had been stalking him for months. The lights were off in his bedroom, and the darkness closed in on him.Isaiah Renfro, a top freshman wide receiver at the University of Washington, was at his home in South Los Angeles. He had to leave in the morning for spring practice, which was about to start in Seattle. But he could tell: Another storm was coming, a gale of anxiety and depression.He slammed his suitcase shut and stood near his bed, steeling for a struggle that he was never sure he could win. He breathed hard, and tried to stay on his feet. Now the tempest was upon him. All the pressure. The worries. Football. Family. The feeling that he could never measure up.He saw only one way out.He went to the kitchen, careful not to wake his mother or little sister. From the refrigerator, he took a bottle of vodka. In a medicine cabinet, he found some Dilaudid, a powerful opioid painkiller he had used after an injury. He poured the pills into one hand. With the other he drank the vodka. He washed down one pill after another, pill after pill after pill.He typed a note on his iPhone: “If I die before I wake, I pray to the Lord my momma straight, there is always food on my sister’s plate.”Back in his bedroom, he lay his head against a pillow and waited.“It is time,” he said to himself. “It is time to leave this world. It is time. It is time.”Maybe you have never heard of Isaiah Renfro. He did not start at the University of Washington, nor did he play in the N.F.L. But you should know his struggle. There are scores like him, young athletes on college campuses grappling with mental illness — a crisis that is only now getting serious attention.What experts know is this: Recent studies place suicide as the third leading cause of death for college athletes, behind motor vehicle accidents and medical issues.And nearly 25 percent of college athletes who participated in a widely touted 2016 study led by researchers at Drexel University displayed signs of depressive symptoms.Since that percentage is roughly in line with the general college population, the findings countered a long-held belief that athletes are less likely than their peers to become depressed — largely because they benefit from regular, emotion-lifting exercise.As the stigma of mental illness has eased, the reporting of cases has increased. But experts also believe that young athletes now face more stress, which contributes to mental illness, than ever before.“Performance and parental pressure, social media, more games on TV, more players who think they can go to the pros,” said Timothy Neal, the director of athletic training education at Concordia University in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a nationally recognized expert on mental health and college sports.The N.C.A.A. is playing catch-up.“We are still so young in addressing this,” said Brian Hainline, a neurologist who in 2013 became the N.C.A.A.’s first chief medical officer. He cited increasing concern not only about depression, but also about bipolar, eating, anxiety and attention deficit disorders, as well as addiction. “Mental health is our single most important priority.”What happened to Isaiah Renfro seemed to be a result of this combustible mix, where brain chemistry meets the burdens of reaching success and then maintaining it. He was hardly alone in his struggle. Isaiah was fast and strong. Bush Hamdan, Washington’s offensive coordinator, said he marveled at the sight of the young wide receiver sprinting across the field as a freshman. “Size, speed, physicality, he checked off all the boxes.”If everything had gone according to plan, Isaiah would have been a senior for the Huskies this season. Hamdan could imagine him in a leading role on the current team, which is ranked among the best in college football. “Even when I look at our roster now,” he said, “there is a big hole there, a great big hole. Because Isaiah was that talented.”He had been one of Coach Chris Petersen’s first recruits, and the Huskies awarded him a full athletic scholarship. But from his initial moment on campus, in the summer of 2015, he did not feel right.Part of the reason was the grueling slog of practice: the long hours, the intense workouts and the interminable team meetings — day after day, week after week. He had little time to gain a sense of his surroundings. From his dorm to Husky Stadium, he walked a slightly uphill path. He was so sore it felt as if he were climbing a mountain.“Culture shock,” he told friends back in Los Angeles.He knew he would be playing elite college football. “But all of a sudden,” he said, he was “part of this big machine.”It made him feel like a cog.He nonetheless cast aside his growing anguish and melancholy and showed striking prowess for an 18-year-old. Instead of holding him out for a season, a common approach for freshmen so they can learn the rigors of major-college football, the coaches played him right away.He had a breakout performance in a victory against Arizona. On his second catch, he broke three tackles and picked up 10 extra yards.“Isaiah Renfro in the red zone! Impressive!” Petersen told reporters.Winter approached. Isaiah joked and smiled to hide his darkening mood. He feared his coaches and teammates would think he was weak. He had always been a good student, and among the smartest players on any of his teams. But now he did not let on that while studying he often found himself sitting frozen in front of his laptop, his head spinning with so many thoughts he could not hold on to any of them. Or that on the field there were times when he would run to the line of scrimmage, unable to recall what his quarterback had just told him to do. He confided to his mother that he felt awful. Her response, thinking he was merely homesick, was: Buck up.He could not.While in Tempe, for a game against Arizona State, a sense of deep fear, anguish and guilt seized him. He locked himself in his hotel bathroom. He punched a mirror with all his strength, to see how much he could feel.He would remember feeling nothing.The next afternoon, he caught three passes for 30 yards.A week later, the Huskies took a five-hour bus ride to Corvallis, Ore., to play Oregon State. He and his girlfriend had argued, and he felt as if his blood were ablaze. On the bus, he felt dizzy. He closed his eyes and blacked out, he said. Nobody noticed. He woke up just as the Huskies reached their hotel.Over the phone to his mother, his voice sounded flat and distant. It had been that way for too long, and she realized Isaiah’s problem had to be more than homesickness. Worried, she reached out to a sports psychologist in Washington’s athletic department.Isaiah began meeting with her. He told her about his deepest emotions. Together, they focused on why he was playing football. Was he doing it for himself? Or because excelling on the gridiron was something others expected and wanted of him?Once, he went into a private room near her office and cried.The therapy helped. He told his mother that the sessions were keeping his life from crumbling. What he didn’t tell her was that he had begun to have suicidal thoughts. Hamdan recalled December of that season, the weeks before a bowl game against Southern Mississippi, when he first began to realize how badly Isaiah was struggling.“You’d look at him,” Hamdan said, “and he just seemed vacant.”Still, neither Hamdan nor any of the other coaches knew the depths of Isaiah’s despair. One morning, walking in the wet, gloomy darkness, Isaiah saw a city bus across from Husky Stadium.What if he threw himself in front of it? he recalled thinking.Would he die?He hoped so. Named for the Old Testament prophet of salvation, Isaiah was born and raised in Los Angeles. His parents, Chieko Woods and Barry Renfro, split up when he was 18 months old. For the rest of his childhood, he bounced between them, living in neighborhoods that ranged from the middle-class suburbs of north L.A. to the city’s more impoverished south. Football steadied him.His father remembered teaching 2-year-old Isaiah hand-eye coordination by tossing miniature footballs to him and backing up a step every time he caught one with confidence. By junior high, he was the fastest, the toughest and the most coordinated player in his youth football league.Yet he was also sensitive and anxious.He suffered terrible night terrors into his years as a toddler. In junior high, he bit his fingernails to the nub. By the start of high school, he battled a constant upset stomach, which worsened whenever he felt the pressure of a looming game.“If he wasn’t playing well, or if he played well and the team lost,” Chieko Woods recalled, “he took everything just so hard.”That included his relationship with his hard-charging father.“My dad was a football coach first with me,” Isaiah would say when he tried to understand his anguish. “Anything he didn’t accomplish, he wanted me to accomplish. He played football and didn’t make it to the N.F.L., so my football was basically his life.”At first, his father said, he did not want Isaiah to play tackle football at all. But after Isaiah announced he wanted to make it to Division I football in college and then move to the pros, he supported his son with extra coaching and prodding, running his boy through drills and spending what little extra money he had on tutors to hone Isaiah’s skills.“You’ve got to get some kind of pressure, some kind of push, if you want to play D-I football or pro football,” said Barry Renfro, who played at Miami of Ohio in the 1990s. “I had visions of me playing in the N.F.L. I didn’t make it to the Promised Land, but I know how to get there and I know what it takes. He got pushed to a degree, but it was hardly nothing tyrannical or nothing crazy.”By the time he was a high school senior, Isaiah had come to pride himself on being strong: The kid without a weakness, the savior of others. Zay, as he became known, was smart and witty. He was 6-foot-2 and had a wide, expressive face. He loved art and fashion. His friends were diverse: white and black, Asian and Latino, rich and poor. “The guy just had it all,” Brock Bell, one of his football teammates, said. “On the outside, always so happy. Carefree. It looked like he was so comfortable in his own skin.”Yet there were cracks.Few knew that his charisma could fade when he was alone. Sometimes he fled to his room, silent and sad to the marrow.At the time, he was living with his father. They argued bitterly, prompting Isaiah to move in with classmates. His sadness became more intense. He vowed never to speak to his father again. He vowed, too, that one day he would play in the N.F.L. and have the means to move his mother and half sister out of the blighted neighborhood they lived in as they struggled financially.His drive resulted in injuries. He ripped a meniscus and wrenched his back. During the first half of one game, he rammed his head so hard into a tackler’s knee that he had trouble remembering the rest of the night.A friend urged him to sit out for a while. But he refused. “Who else is going to play my part?” he said. “Who else is going to carry the team? Who else?”Mark Serve, the offensive coordinator for Sierra Canyon School, where Isaiah played high school ball, recalled an outburst the normally unruffled wide receiver had after an opposing team taunted him with racial insults in a game. At halftime, he fell apart, blaming himself for letting his teammates down and raging at the opposing players.“Did you hear what they’re saying?” Isaiah shouted, tears flowing, when Serve confronted him. “Did you hear? Why are they calling me that? Why? I’m not going to take it anymore!”Serve, who is black and Latino, understood Isaiah’s anger. But because of Isaiah’s usual composure, the response seemed outsized, frenetic, unhinged. “Looking back on it now,” Serve said, “I wonder about that moment. Was that a sign? What, exactly, did we miss?”Isaiah first tried to kill himself shortly after Christmas in 2015. He swallowed leftover pills that University of Washington Medical Center records show were Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication. They were not strong enough to do the job. He felt dizzy and sick to his stomach, but somehow, a few hours later, he trudged somberly off to practice. That day, he crossed a threshold that psychologists say is dangerous: Going from thinking about suicide to actually attempting it increased the chances that another, more lethal attempt would follow.Isaiah soldiered through the Seattle winter. In March, during a break, he went home to his mother’s house in Los Angeles. It was there that he drank the vodka, there that he swallowed the Dilaudid, there that he lay on his bed and told himself it was finally time to leave this world.“It is time. It is time.”But hours later, he woke up.He wrote on his cellphone: “You’re alive. “I’m not supposed to be here.”He told no one what he had done. He still felt a duty to his team. He returned to Seattle, determined to endure. But there were signs he would not make it.Rob Scheidegger, head trainer for the Huskies, noticed. “This wasn’t the happy-go-lucky-seeming kid who I had met earlier in the year.”He decided to visit Isaiah in his dorm room. There was nothing on the walls. No photos. No posters. The curtains were closed. The room reminded Scheidegger of a cave.Isaiah stood near the door. He moved and spoke slowly. Scheidegger told him to reach out to the athletic department psychologist.He did.But by dawn, another storm seized him.“I need to go to the hospital,” he remembered telling the psychologist over the phone. “I need to go now.” At the hospital, a doctor wrote on his intake form: “Suicidal ideation, worsened recently by life stressors.” Isaiah had “a plan, along with means to carry out this plan (prescription anxiety and depression medications).”He was assigned a room in the psychiatric unit. “In there by myself, cut off from the world, I felt like a crazy person,’’ Isaiah recalled. “I mean, I had to face it: I was really in a psych ward.”His days were filled with rest, contemplation and therapy. Doctors told him that the mental illness he struggled against was not his fault, that depression and anxiety had deep biological roots, which probably were affecting his brain chemistry.Isaiah barely communicated with his parents. His emotions toward both, he said, were too raw. He also did not want his teammates to know where he was. He had long been able to keep his troubles from his coaches.But by now Coach Petersen knew. Through a spokesman, Petersen declined to be interviewed for this article, but several people said he had begun meeting regularly with his staff to discuss Isaiah and to make sure he was getting the help he needed.As much as he respected Petersen, Isaiah did not want to talk to him. Doing so would have reminded him of football — which he was trying to get away from.“Inside the hospital, I could think,” Isaiah said. “I just finally had the space to do what I needed to do to heal.”Sometimes he ambled along a tree-lined path on the hospital grounds. Husky Stadium loomed across the street.Spring practice was in full swing. He could hear the air horns that signaled drills. With each blast, he flinched. What he thought of most was quitting college and football, for good.Isaiah was back in Los Angeles with friends when he tweeted his decision. The tweet was from his heart and to the point.We met at Du-Par’s, a venerable diner at the Original Farmers Market in Los Angeles. It was late February, just over two years since Isaiah Renfro had last stepped onto a football field.His smile was open and hopeful. He told me that he wanted to tell his story to ease the stigma of mental illness, especially for young black athletes like himself. Helping others soothed him. He still needed that. He recalled the jolt he had felt upon hearing the news that Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski had committed suicide just a few weeks previously. Isaiah had known Hilinski, who was also from Southern California. They had played in some of the same summer football leagues.Even though he was taking an antidepressant, he told me that coming home to Los Angeles had not unfolded the way he had hoped.A few weeks after returning, a judge granted Isaiah’s petition to change his surname to Woods, his mother’s maiden name, from Renfro. Meant to signal a fresh start, the change provided a boost, however short-lived. “I had no confidence in myself,” Isaiah said. “I was just shattered. No self-belief to start moving forward.”He endured weeks and months of rudderless inactivity and doubts.He lived with his mother, but that, too, became a source of stress at times. It was hard not to feel he had let her down.There were long walks in the Los Angeles foothills and a job in an ice cream shop near Venice Beach, which forced him to be around people.A big part of surviving was Madison Bickel, whom he met when she came to Los Angeles on a visit from college in Portland, Ore. Bright, ambitious and empathetic, she centered him.He told me they had begun talking about his future. Aside from catching a few televised minutes of the 2016 national championship semifinal between Washington and the University of Alabama, he had not paid attention to any sports since leaving Seattle. But football, he had come to realize, was still deeply a part of him. He missed the camaraderie. Missed the competition. Missed lining up against a defensive back, matching wits and physical skill. What if he went back to the game? He decided it would not be wise to return to the bright lights and the grind of a big-time school like Washington.Maybe Portland State, a team that played home games in front of a few thousand fans and had just gone winless for an entire season. Portland State, which occasionally played the best-known schools but was in a conference stocked with unheralded teams like the Southern Utah Thunderbirds. He loved the idea. He could join Madison. Maybe he could get back into the game he still loved, but with less stress.Before long, he was back at Sierra Canyon, practicing under Coach Serve’s watchful eye. At first, he felt tentative, but he also felt something good: He finally realized he needed to prove that he could handle stress and succeed.For himself. For no one else.He sat on a leather chair in the small office of Bruce Barnum, the head coach at Portland State. He looked Barnum in the eye and unspooled his story.“He didn’t hold back,” Barnum said. “He told me about all the dark closets, all the difficulty he had experienced. His willingness to confront this stood out in a way that I’ll never forget.”Barnum had a keen sensitivity to the emotions of his players after two of them died in 2016: one from an overdose and another from a complication after a tonsillectomy. That same year, a player’s child was killed in a car accident.The losses had cast a cloud over the team. But even apart from those terrible deaths, Barnum said he had seen an increase in concern about mental illness among his players.“It used to be that kids never came to me about this stuff,” he said. “It did exist, but nobody wanted to talk about it. Now they are coming to me all the time with things that are serious — a handful in just the last few months.”To Barnum, Isaiah was not just a significant talent; he was also someone who could be a beacon, proof to his team that mental illness could be tamed.“I will be paying attention if you come here,” Barnum told Isaiah. “But I can’t know everything. Come to me if you need help. I know where to get it.”Isaiah accepted a full scholarship. He started college in time for three weeks of spring practice in March.I watched a lot of those practices. After two years off and all that he had gone through, he was not what he was at Washington, but there were flickers of it when he would acrobatically snatch the ball amid a thicket of defenders.Isaiah told me there were still times when he could feel stress gathering. But so far there had been no full-blown storms.“Progress,” he said. “Yep, progress.”He emerged as a leader. His fun-loving side was starting to show. He led his teammates in a music video. There he was, shirtless, dancing in the Portland State locker room, holding a boom box that blared the rap hit “I Bet You Won’t” as other players leapt around him.Word spread about what he had been through and his willingness to discuss it. It was not long before teammates came to him for advice on dealing with their own emotional and mental troubles, as Barnum had hoped. “Isaiah is so easy to talk to about stuff I normally wouldn’t tell anybody,” said one player, who confided to me his own struggles with depression. “It’s easy because he will just listen and then come up with some wisdom.’’Yet one day over the summer, the tempest holding just off shore rumbled in.It came after his girlfriend’s car broke down during a trip they took to Crater Lake. They were stranded for a while and got a hotel room, where panic suddenly tore through him.“Oh, my God, I thought I was doing better than this,” he said, moaning. Madison tried holding him as he trembled. “I thought I was past this part,” he told her. “I will never be able to beat it. I’ll never beat it. It’s just too much.”Finally, he slept. When he awoke, his mind was blank, as if it were trying to push away the pain.A few days later, I asked Isaiah and Madison what had caused the panic attack. Isaiah said he could not be sure. Just as he could not be sure what had caused his underlying depression and anxiety in the first place.Madison chimed in, pointing out recent studies linking depression to concussions and the blows to the head common in football. It was something she worried about. But Isaiah said he did not. He said the studies were too new, too inconclusive. Besides, he figured, wide receivers get hit in the head far less than linemen or linebackers.What about Hilinski, the Washington State quarterback who had killed himself, the young player Isaiah had known? The autopsy showed signs of early-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the condition that many researchers have linked to a host of health issues, including deep depression.Isaiah said he did not know about Hilinski’s brain-study results. And he was resolute. “It is not going to stop me,” he said.In August, weak and thin from a virus that had kept him from working out for nearly a month, he worked his way in once more with the team.A few practices in, he strained a ligament in his knee and was forced to the sideline for days more. He grew gloomy, convinced he was letting down his teammates, letting down the coaches who had given him a second chance. Saddled with growing despair, he began having trouble getting out of bed for morning treatments on his knee.Barnum noticed. He met with Isaiah in his office again. “There is no pressure here,” Barnum recalled saying. “Even if you never play a snap for us, just having you here and seeing you graduate, seeing you keep learning about yourself, that’ll be enough.”He made sure Isaiah connected with counselors. It was an important step. Since leaving Seattle, Isaiah had refused to visit a psychologist. He had insisted he was strong enough to forge past tough times with willpower and a daily antidepressant. Now he began seeing a therapist again. “I’ll have to manage it for the rest of my life,” he said of his mental illness. “You see, it doesn’t just go away like most people think.” He paused and gathered his thoughts.“That doesn’t mean I can’t live my life. It doesn’t mean I can’t go for my goals.”The season was about to begin. There was one big goal ahead. He had to achieve it to prove to himself that he was on the right path.He had to take the field for a game.Isaiah slammed his helmet to the ground. He crouched for a while behind a low barrier, as if he did not want to be seen.Nothing was going right for him. Portland State was playing its third game of the 2018 season, but its first at home, at Hillsboro Stadium, in front of a few thousand fans. By the middle of the third quarter, he had been on the field for a handful of snaps. Not a single pass had been thrown his way. He put a towel over his head and sat glumly on the bench. Sensing despair, a stream of teammates sidled beside him, reminding him to stay positive.But staying positive had not been easy. Just before the season opener, the team’s trainers ruled that his knee had not healed. So he stayed home when the Vikings bused to Reno to play Nevada.The next week, his team had gone to Eugene to play Oregon. Isaiah suited up, but because he had missed so much practice, he sat on the bench for the entire 62-14 loss. On the bus ride home, he barely spoke.Now it was Sept. 15, and his Vikings were playing the College of Idaho. Madison was there with her parents. His mother had flown to the game from Los Angeles. He imagined starring in front of them, scoring at least once.“I just want to show I can play,” he told me, days before, his voice both full of hope and doleful.But by the third quarter, the Vikings were dominating — only he still wasn’t much a part of the mix.Then Barnum shouted across the sideline, “We’re going to get Isaiah the ball!”The Vikings roared.Isaiah leapt from the bench.He fastened his helmet and sprinted on the field.At the snap, he took a single step back, caught a spiral, and tore toward the goal line, stiff-arming a defender as his teammates on the sideline erupted in joy. Fourteen yards later, he was pushed out of bounds.It wasn’t a touchdown. There would be no touchdown for him on this day. He wasn’t happy with that. But this much Isaiah knew: He was back.Isaiah Woods ended up playing in most of Portland State’s games this season. He did not emerge as a starter and had only a handful of catches. His best performance came on Friday, in the final game of 2018 for his four-win team. He had three receptions for 24 yards in a 74-23 loss to Eastern Washington. Throughout much of the season, his performance and playing time wore heavily on him. But therapy sessions with a campus counselor helped him gain an increasingly mature perspective, as did regular chats and his growing bond with Bruce Barnum, his coach, who plans for Isaiah to have a major role on the team next year. “Maybe not playing as much as I wanted when I came back to the game was a good thing,” Isaiah told me this week. “I am not a patient person, and this season taught me patience. It taught me that I need to remind myself to slow down, enjoy my surroundings, the people around me, the process I am on. And most of all, enjoy my life.”If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.

"PARIS — Brazilian soccer legend Pele was discharged from a French hospital on Monday after recovering from a urinary infection, media in France reported.Pele, 78, was admitted to the hospital in Paris last Wednesday with a strong fever, after attending an event in the city with France's World Cup-winning player Kylian Mbappe.Pele, considered by many as soccer's best-ever player and the winner of three World Cups with the Brazilian national team, was treated with antibiotics and said on Friday he was feeling much better.There was no immediate confirmation of the discharge from Pele's press office in Brazil.

"As is tradition, President Trump hosted the champions of college football, the Clemson Tigers, for a celebration of their athletic achievement at the White House on Monday.The food he offered them was far less traditional.Piles of burgers and fish sandwiches from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King, still in their boxes and wrappers, were served on trays in the candlelit dining room. Tubs of dipping sauces were stacked in silver gravy boats. On another table, heat lamps kept French fries and Domino’s pizzas warm. Salads were available, too.It was an opulent setting for fast-food fare. Visiting players are typically offered a meal from the White House kitchen, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the government shutdown necessitated a new menu.“Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed — so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone’s favorite fast foods,” she said.The substitution didn’t seem to bother Mr. Trump, and perhaps even delighted him.“I like it all,” he told reporters before the players arrived. “It’s all good stuff. Great American food.”Mr. Trump has long professed a love for fast food. He values its efficiency and consistency, and as a self-professed “germaphobe,” has said uniform health standards make him more confident in its cleanliness. He used to eat it several times per week.He’s far from alone in loving fast food. About one-third of American adults eat fast food on any given day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, the sight of the fast-food cartons inside the stately White House dining room struck some observers on social media as incongruous — or lacking in hospitality for a celebration. (No players looked particularly dissatisfied as cameras rolled.)It also promoted cuisine that nutritionists warn is high in calories, fat and sodium, and that increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases.Such events, ostensibly a tribute to championship teams, are unavoidably political. Mr. Trump abruptly disinvited the N.F.L. champion Philadelphia Eagles last year after most of the players and coaches said they would boycott the visit. The Golden State Warriors declined to visit after winning the N.B.A. championship last year.With reporters gathered before the players arrived, on a day he stayed inside the White House, Mr. Trump was eager to drive the discussion back to the weekslong government shutdown. After showing off the food spread, he pivoted to making his case for Republican unity and the need for the border wall.“It should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it’s going to happen now, it’s going to happen now,” he said.Without missing a beat, he continued: “Thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy your food.”"
"The 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way."

"MELBOURNE, Australia — As Mason Cox sprinted toward the football, one thought ran through his mind: attack it.He leapt up onto the back of the defender in front of him, using him as a stepladder to bring himself closer to the dropping ball. He timed his leap to perfection, turning his 6-foot-11 body into a long crane, and plucked the yellow, oval-shaped ball out of the night sky.It was a clean and pivotal mark, or catch, 25 meters (27 yards) out from goal in an Australian rules football match. Cox would finish that game with eight contested marks — the second-highest ever in an Australian Football League playoff game — and three goals. His team, Collingwood Football Club of Melbourne, won that playoff game but lost in the grand final — Australia’s Super Bowl — the next week.Yet Cox stood out for another reason: He is an American, from Highland Village north of Dallas. In the last five years, a handful of Americans, generally tall men performing a specialized role, have been contracted by A.F.L. clubs. By the beginning of the 2018 season in March, Cox was the only one still left in the league.He has become a bit of a sensation in Australia, a fan favorite whose goals are often met with chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” He has been welcomed in part because Australians would love to see more global recognition for their homegrown sport. He has also shown a playful embrace of the country, wearing a “Crocodile Dundee” outfit to a team party and joking on Instagram, “I think I qualify for citizenship now.” (Cox intends on beginning the process of becoming an Australian citizen in December.)“Footy’s something I take very seriously in my life,” Cox said in an interview, using the Australian nickname for the sport. “I put a lot of effort and time into it and it’s something that this city is so crazy for. You can’t get away from it sometimes, because you go down the street and people want to talk about the last game you played.”With the exception of Irishmen — Gaelic football is similar to Australian rules football — foreigners are a rare sight in the A.F.L.But Cox, 27, who now speaks with a healthy dose of Australian accent, could be the perfect brand builder, giving international cachet to a domestic sport that began as a means of keeping cricketers fit during their off-season in the winter.The A.F.L. has long craved international expansion and recognition — the league started playing an international rules series against Ireland in 1984 and, in the past decade, it has played exhibition games in Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and London.Still, Cox may well be the last American to make it in the A.F.L. In March, the league announced that it would be shelving its combine in the United States — which it had been holding annually since 2012 — for at least a year as it made Ireland the priority in its search for international talent.An earlier edition of that combine changed Cox’s life.In the spring of 2014, a few months before graduating from Oklahoma State University, where he walked onto the basketball team, he received an invitation to attend a combine for the A.F.L. in Los Angeles. He had never heard of the league.But the league had a shortage of people capable of performing the specialized role of ruckman/center-half-forward, which requires someone at least 6 feet 6 inches tall, mobile, athletic and well coordinated with both their hands and their feet.In an island nation of about 25 million people, there just aren’t many who fit that bill. But there are plenty of American college basketball players who do.Cox was one of them, and he killed it at the combine.After a visit with several teams in Australia, he received four contract offers. Cox had already accepted a job as an engineer with Exxon Mobil in Houston, figuring his athletic career was over, but backed out of it to sign with Collingwood in Melbourne in 2014.Upon arriving at the football club in late August 2014, he and Craig McRae, the club’s then head of development, went to work. “We just got into the everyday grind of getting it all done and really locked into it,” Cox recalled with a smile.Initially, like many a novice, Cox dropped the Australian football onto his foot with two hands. This was problematic, McRae explained, because “the ball’s going to be dropped — particularly a 7-foot guy — the ball’s going to be dropped from a long way above the ground, so then there’s so much room for error.”Therefore, “our game requires you to guide the ball” onto the boot with “one hand.”Cox’s progression was rapid. Less than two weeks after he first picked up an A.F.L. ball at Collingwood’s facility, he hit McRae in stride with a laces-out, 45-meter, or 49-yard, low drop punt.Four weeks later, Cox was consistently dropping the ball onto his foot with a one-handed guide.For the specialized skill of contested marking, or catching the ball in a crowd, McRae took Cox to see Anthony Rocca, Collingwood’s then development coach, once a week. “His hands were really clean,” McRae recalled, taking note of Cox’s big hands. “He just wouldn’t fumble.”By the end of his three-month, intensive course in Australian rules football with McRae and Rocca, Cox was able to join the rest of Collingwood’s professional footballers in preseason training. He then played for Collingwood’s minor league team for just over a season before making his big league debut in April 2016.He scored a goal with his very first kick. By the beginning of this season’s finals — the Australian term for playoffs — he had firmly established himself as a solid role player.But Cox’s breakout performance in the preliminary final two weeks ago suggested that he might be on the cusp of becoming a transcendent star. His strong performance — two goals and a deft assist — in Collingwood’s nail-biting grand final loss to the West Coast Eagles a week later reinforced that tantalizing notion.Rocca, who still coaches Cox, believes that the American has only just started scratching the surface of his enormous potential, saying that his scope for future improvement “is absolutely huge.”Cox has embraced Australia’s culture, values, lifestyle and even language. He said that he especially likes Melbourne, his adopted hometown.“Something that I’ve loved since I’ve been here is it’s a multicultural melting pot,” he said.He eats pho on Victoria Street; he enjoys Greek and Italian food and culture in Melbourne’s northern suburbs; and he has befriended people from many different ethnic backgrounds: His best friends include a Vietnamese-Australian whose family came to Australia as refugees, a Filipino-Australian and a recently arrived Swede.Cox’s speech is peppered with Australian vernacular. He speaks of “university,” not “college,” and expresses his full agreement with something another person says with the ubiquitous Australianism “a hundred percent.”And he has picked up a distinct Australian accent. Even his family has noticed. “When he gets home, we put him right back into place very quickly,” his oldest brother Nolan said, with a laugh."
"SPARKILL, N.Y. — In much of the United States, this is an era of disappearing tackle football programs. Tightening budgets and concerns about safety and liability have combined to spell the end of football at colleges like Hofstra in Hempstead, N.Y., and St. Mary’s College of California.Then there is St. Thomas Aquinas, a 65-year-old college founded by Dominican nuns, which is currently running a counter play. It started a football program this season instead of ending one. The move, part of a strategy to increase male enrollment, not really one to compete for gridiron glory, came with a wrinkle: At St. Thomas Aquinas, students would compete in sprint football, in which the players cannot weigh more than 178 pounds. There is blocking and tackling, and players wear helmets and shoulder pads, and the game has plenty of opportunity for injury. But in sprint football, punishing collisions between 300-pound linemen and 190-pound tailbacks cannot occur. The game is more about speed and swing plays out wide than about pounding runs into the line and passes over the middle.Given that, administrators at St. Thomas Aquinas, a private liberal arts college of roughly 2,200 students 15 miles north of New York City, said the benefits of fielding a squad outweighed the costs. They also saw sprint football as a safer alternative to conventional football, amid worries about brain injuries from repeated blows to the head. As insurance, the college’s athletic director, Gerry Oswald, also bought helmets equipped with sensors to alert trainers on the sideline when a player absorbed a big blow.“So far, knock on wood, we haven’t had any really serious injuries,” Oswald said in a recent interview. “It’s a very competitive game, but within a reasonable weight limit on the field.”That weight limit carries its own requirements and regimens. One morning in August, Lori Rahaim, the head athletic trainer, walked into the college library, set up equipment and addressed 63 members of the team. It was training camp, and Rahaim had to explain what she expected from them regarding everything from hygiene to hydration. When done, she issued an order.“I need you to strip down to as little clothing as possible,” she said. “Sneakers, shoes come off; socks stay on, and some kind of short apparel stays on.”“In the library?” wideout James Hanigan said.“We have three already-calibrated digital scales,” she said. “We’re not messing around.”The weigh-ins happen twice per week in season. “Mama’s cooking, mama’s cooking,” the team’s head coach, Matt Barry, said that day. “You got to stay off it if you want to make it. We’ve got starters at 150 pounds. There are no hogs here.”The Spartans finished their first season with a 2-4 record. It was capped by a 33-12 loss to Mansfield University of Pennsylvania last Friday. It was a long way from four years ago, when Oswald raised the idea of bringing football to the college, where 54 percent of the students are female. Administrators considered the proposal, then set it aside. Margaret Fitzpatrick, the college’s president, later conferred with her colleagues at Chestnut Hill College, in Philadelphia, and Caldwell University, in New Jersey. Like St. Thomas, they compete at the Division II level in other sports. Fitzpatrick learned about their experiences with sprint football, and then gave Oswald the green light last year.“I had a program before I even had a football,” Oswald said.The Spartans gained admission to the Collegiate Sprint Football League, which governs the sport, in January. Barry, who was hired a few months earlier, hit the recruiting trail. His sprint football practices were conducted in nearby Tallman Mountain State Park while land was cleared on college property to make way for a 60-yard practice field across the street from a convent. Only one goal post was raised because if balls were kicked on the other end of the field, they would fly into electrical wires. Barry adjusted to the role of building from rock bottom.“My own mother called this spring football,” he said. “She’s 91. She goes, ‘Tell me why again you’re playing in the spring?’ I said, ‘Mom, it’s sprint!’ My sister made a big sign: SPRINT FOOTBALL. My buddies ask, ‘Is it flag?’”Barry, who had coached conventional football at several high schools, never watched a sprint game before taking the job. Games can be hard to find. There are only 10 teams that play sprint football at the college level. The College Sprint Football League traces its roots to the Eastern 150-Pound Football League, which was founded in 1938 in response to the increasing size of college football players at the time. Army, Navy, Cornell, Penn and Princeton were the original members, but the league, which doubled in size over the last decade, has gradually increased the allowable weight.It took one college dropping out for St. Thomas to enter the fraternity. In 2016, Princeton, which continues to play conventional football in the Ivy League, ended its sprint football program after 106 consecutive losses. University officials announced that a committee “concluded that maintaining the program in its current form creates an unacceptably high risk of injury and does not permit the team to aspire to the level of success that Princeton expects.”In stepped the Spartans. Players came from Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Rhode Island to join teammates mostly from New York. Over the course of a few months, Joe Frias, a 6-foot lineman from Washington Heights, dropped from 260 pounds to 183 pounds and finally reached the required goal before the third game. Rahaim and Barry implored players to be healthy. To guard against players trying to sweat off extra pounds or purging, urine samples are taken and body fat percentages are examined. When Barry walked through the cafeteria during a recent lunch hour, players held up plates with chicken and broccoli.“I used to use a Lombardi saying: ‘You’ve got to pay the price,’” he said. “Now it is: ‘You’ve got to lose the weight!’”Some of the players said they came to the college specifically for the chance to play football, so one might say the program has already improved enrollment. “We’ve seen an immediate effect,” said Michael DiBartolomeo, the university’s vice president for enrollment. “Overall numbers are up. More males on campus and in residence halls.”Barry’s Spartans proved to be quick learners, or else they were simply good at football despite their size. In the opening game, at a home field 19 miles from campus, they rushed out to a 30-0 lead over Post University, of Waterbury, Conn., and won, 30-7, in front of 1,300 fans. Afterward, bagpipers from the Emerald Society serenaded Barry in the parking lot as his players stripped off gear inside a practice bubble that doubled as a locker room. The director of football operations ordered 90 pizzas to celebrate. When the pizza arrived, players debated whether to eat it. They knew they would have to weigh in again three days later.“Is there a healthier option?” quarterback Luke Sullivan said."
"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Ed Hobson stood up in the bleachers along the first-base line at Field 7 in the Mets’ spring training facility Saturday morning, having driven 300 miles to monitor one man.“Hoping to meet St. Timothy,” said Hobson, an assistant chief at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “We even have a four-foot alligator in front of our house. We named him Tebow because he’s the greatest Gator of all time.”He was referring, of course, to Tim Tebow, the former football player and current Mets farmhand. Hobson, a University of Florida alumnus like Tebow, had never seen him in the flesh, but he wore a T-shirt emblazoned “Team Tebow.” Hobson’s 6-year-old son, Liam, wore a replica of Tebow’s old No. 15 Florida football jersey.They were on a family pilgrimage. The night before, they hopped in a Honda Odyssey at their home near the Georgia coast to observe the latest stop on Tebow’s baseball journey. Father and son moved closer to the chain-link fence as Tebow made the first steps in his transition from a Class AA All-Star to training for the Syracuse Mets in Class AAA.Tebow, 31, strode into this third spring training with a confident gait, intent on not repeating past missteps. Last February, Tebow failed to make it past a sprinkler head during drill work and sprained his ankle. The injury worsened as a result of Tebow’s refusal to rest, and he collected just one hit in 18 at-bats, all as a designated hitter, in seven spring games.“I didn’t play one snap of outfield,” he said Saturday before catching his slip into football vernacular.Forgive Tebow. In the gig economy, he has remained on the go. During the fall and winter, he returned to work as a college football analyst for ESPN. Still, he swung in batting cages on college campuses between on-camera appearances. On the day of the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, he performed his television duties in the morning, went to Tulane University for batting practice and then returned to the stadium for the game. In a suite, he discussed his swing with his hitting coach, Jay Gibbons, the former Dodger and Oriole who travels with Tebow.“When you give me enough time, I’m going to just make up that ground, those tiny inches every day,” Tebow said. “That’s my mind-set: Just keep working; get a little bit better.”Though Tebow has been out of the N.F.L. since 2015 — and had not appeared in a regular-season game since 2012 — football still calls. In recent weeks, Tebow turned down an offer to play for Coach Steve Spurrier’s Orlando Apollos in the Alliance of American Football, a nascent league populated with former N.F.L. players like Tebow, who played three seasons. Before reporting to Mets camp, Tebow also walked down the red carpet at the premiere of “Run the Race,” a faith-based movie he co-produced with his brother, Robby.He maintained, though, that neither film nor football could lure him away from the diamond now.“No way could I stop and not give this the chance after everything I’ve worked for,” he said. “This is what I’m in now, and I’m all in.”Tebow commenced his latest campaign in the batting cage. He then ran down fly balls in the outfield, backpedaling and making over-the-shoulder catches. When he walked to home plate with his bat, he received hugs from Omar Minaya, the special assistant to the general manager; Brodie Van Wagenen, the general manager; and Fred Wilpon, the team owner. On pitch after pitch, Tebow, who batted .273 with the Class AA Binghamton Rumble Ponies last summer, turned his hips and connected with the ball. Seven of his hits cleared the right-field fence.“It’s raw power,” Manager Mickey Callaway said. “It’s real. The bat moves through the zone pretty swiftly. He’s got to continue to work on handling certain zones, but he puts the barrel on the ball, and it goes a long way.”Tebow also could not help but weigh in on the recent story that transcended both of his sports. While on assignment for ESPN, he met Kyler Murray, the Oklahoma quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy last season after being picked by Oakland in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft. Murray recently announced his decision to play football professionally, instead of baseball. Tebow, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, understood his position better than most.“I think this was a really tough decision for him,” Tebow said. “He loves two sports, and I can really relate to that. And he went with something that he’s been really good at lately and dominating in. When we talked about it, and we did talk about that, I just gave him the advice to follow your heart. Whatever you’re passionate about.”He recalled telling Murray: “You know what? Don’t do it for your agents, or your friends and sometimes necessarily even your family. Do it for what’s on your heart, and don’t let other people define you. You’re going to have all these coaches that you look up to and everybody else that’s going to tell you what they think, but what’s most important is following your heart and your passion.”Reminders of Tebow’s past life greeted him on the other side of the fence after his first workout. One spectator held up a photo of him celebrating with football teammates at Florida. Another held out a Jets jersey with his No. 15 stitched into it. Tebow scrawled his signature for children as he tucked his yellow birch bat with “John 16:33” — a Scripture passage about taking heart and finding peace — marked on the barrel beneath his arm.Anticipation grew for Donna Taaffee, a fan, as she watched him approach.“He’s getting closer!” she said. “Oh my goodness, he’s getting closer!”Tebow smiled as he passed. He then shook the hand of Hobson, whose son held out a baseball and pen for Tebow to sign. Tebow obliged.Hobson joked about catching up later on with Tebow, who recently got engaged to Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, the 2017 Miss Universe pageant winner.“My co-worker and I are going to crash his wedding,” he said."
"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Let’s consider for a moment what could have been.A prizefight of a college football game, with the No. 1 ranked offense (Oklahoma) slugging it out with the No. 2 offense (Alabama) nearly score for score in a College Football Playoff semifinal that would send the winner to the national championship game on Jan. 7.[2019 National Championship: Follow our live coverage of Clemson vs. Alabama]That was true of the second half of the Orange Bowl on Saturday, played at Hard Rock Stadium, in which Oklahoma outscored Alabama, 24-14.But that’s not what the scoreboard said at the end. It read 45-34 in Alabama’s favor, sending the Tide rolling to the national championship game for the fourth consecutive season, this time against Clemson in a rematch of the 2017 title match that Alabama lost to the Tigers.But, oh, to replay that second half and realize that Oklahoma had a formula good enough to go toe-to-toe with Alabama, if only it could have gotten a head of steam from the start. What the final score doesn’t tell you is that Alabama led, 28-0, in the first half.“It was a grudge match. We were throwing pound for pound. They were throwing blows at us, and we were throwing blows at them,” said Xavier McKinney, the Alabama defensive back. “It was a hard-fought game.”Anybody who tuned out the game at halftime, when Alabama held a 31-10 lead and it looked like another chapter on the Crimson Tide’s inevitability and invincibility was being drafted early, missed the real Oklahoma.Alabama Coach Nick Saban knew it was lurking. He threw down his headset in frustration when Alabama settled for a field goal late in the second quarter, stymied by penalties.The gesture seemed over the top, a perfectionist coach frustrated that he could not run the score up on a weaker team. But even if the game plan had allowed for slowing the pace with a commanding lead, going into the game, Saban had warned of Oklahoma’s arsenal and its knack for close wins.“We had a great drive there,” he said at the half. “We took six minutes off the clock, but we didn’t finish.”At halftime, Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley exhorted his players to do what they had done in those close wins: fight and not accept the inevitable.“We’ve been fighting all year,” said Oklahoma receiver Marquise Brown, who was hobbled by a pulled muscle in his left foot. “Our record doesn’t say all the games that we fought. A win is a win, and we had a lot of tough victories. That’s what our team is built around, fighting to the end.”It is also built around the winner of the Heisman Trophy, Kyler Murray, at quarterback.He went 19 for 37 with 308 yards and two touchdowns, both in the second half. One was a 49-yard bomb to Charleston Rambo. Murray also rushed for 109 yards, increasing the scrambling he is known for in the second half.“Kyler Murray is really fast, so chasing him down was a battle,” said linebacker Dylan Moses.Still, even Murray knew the lackluster start was a crippling blow against a team like Alabama.“We started off too slow, and they are a good team,” he said. “We outplayed them the rest of the game, but you can’t go down 21-0” — the score at the end of the first quarter — “against teams like that.”Oklahoma went home with a lot of questions.Murray, a junior, has signed a contract to play baseball with the Oakland Athletics, but he also has not ruled out the possibility of playing in the N.F.L. Riley’s name pops up for the N.F.L. head-coaching jobs likely to open up next week in the annual season-ending round of firings.And the Sooners almost certainly will take stock of their defense, which ranked toward the bottom of the 130 top-level teams in college football. Its potent offense always made up for it — except when it didn’t, on nights like Saturday.As in the N.B.A. and the N.F.L., the balance of power in college football may be shifting to offense-heavy teams. That may be true in general, but not when you are going up against Saban, whose defense and offense are both top-ranked.“When you’re playing against an explosive offensive team who can score very quickly, all parts of your team — special teams, offense, defense, everybody — has got to continue to play well in the game,” Saban said. He added, “It was no surprise to me at all that they were able to make some plays that got them back in the game.”Still, how long can Oklahoma tolerate being a bridesmaid?It has now had back-to-back Heisman winners (Baker Mayfield, now on the Cleveland Browns, won in 2017), has played in the Big 12 Conference championship game almost every year since 2000, and has been in the College Football Playoff three of the last four years.While several of his players and members of their families wept in frustration in and outside the locker room, Riley tried to remain upbeat and bent on assuring them that the national championship trophy was almost in their grasp.“We’ve still got a bunch of Big 12 trophies,” he said. “We’re going to hold that tall skinny one here in a couple years, and we’re going to hold it in a large part because of the fight from these seniors in this program, all the players, the staff.“We’ve had some really good teams here the last four years,” he added, “but I don’t know that we’ve ever had a team — and I just told them that in the locker room — that has had the fight in them that this team has, and that’s going to do wonders for our program. That’s going to make us a better program.”Players, though, dwelled on the sting of the now.“I wanted to win a national championship,” Murray said, with the pain of the loss etched on his face. “And I just fell short.”"
"PASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”"
"A 15-year-old high school football player made a play and was tackled. He walked off the field and didn’t recognize his own mother, who snapped his photo. “I thought he was looking tough,” Kim Gavigan said of her son David, “but he didn’t really know who I was.” It was the second concussion of his short career (the first was at age 8); soon after, he quit the sport. As football season gets underway in high schools and youth leagues across the United States, communities are gathering in their stadiums to cheer and enjoy the sense of togetherness.But overshadowing it all is the threat of brain injury (and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E.) linked to taking hits during football and the angst many parents feel about deciding whether their children should participate. We asked parents, via an unscientific survey, to tell us where they stand on the subject of youth tackle football and heard from dozens. Most said that the research on or personal experience with head injuries had compelled them to forbid their children to play. But the pressure to participate can be intense, especially on boys who are big for their age and even on those who are small. Here is a selection of submissions from parents reflecting on how their boys’ sizes, norms of masculinity and tradition affected their decision. They have been condensed and edited.Please use the comments to tell us about your experiences with the pressures boys face to play tackle football and whether you think the risk is worth it. Children who play football before the age of 12 have a higher rate of cognitive and behavioral problems later in life, according to a study by researchers at Boston University. A study in the journal Brain found evidence of the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., in teenage athletes who sustained head impact injuries. I have a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old boy and I finally let my 13-year-old play last year. He is big for his age and about the size of a high school student. I’m more comfortable with him playing, though it still bothers me. But my 11-year-old is only 85 pounds and would play positions that I have seen get clobbered the most — running back and receiver. I don’t know that I will ever be comfortable letting him play tackle.The real difference between playing tackle football versus flag football is not the skills learned, but the social issues. My kids have repeatedly been called wimps and not “real men” over the years because they have played flag versus tackle.I think safety for our kids dictates they shouldn’t play tackle until at least age 13 or 14. But it will be a very hard sell because of the social bias in our country that “real men” are tough and play tackle football. — Vicki Froslee, Andover, Minn.I am the mother of four sons; we live in Oklahoma, football country. Three of our boys love football and ask to play tackle. In our town they can start at 5 years old. We have opted to play flag football only, due to the risks of concussion. We face a lot of ridicule from friends and relatives, but we cannot in good conscience let our boys play a game so inherently dangerous. The scientific evidence of the damage done by C.T.E. is too strong to ignore. We will never let our children play tackle ball. — Amanda Bryant, Norman, Okla.C.T.E. can develop years after an athlete stops taking knocks to the head. It can cause memory loss, cognitive problems and dementia. But under pressure from a persistent coach who pursues their sons even when they discourage the sport, some parents relent. Other parents embrace football without giving the risk a second thought.My 17-year-old son has participated in team activities since elementary school, but things like the chess team and debate team. Never did I think in a million years that he would join the football team in his senior year in high school. The coach reached out to him over the summer and asked him to join, and I have to believe it was because of his size — 6-3 and just over 200 pounds — but I also wonder if it’s because of low participation due to the risk of injury. I expressed my concern about injury to him and basically begged him not to join the team, but ultimately let him make the decision for himself. He started in his first-ever game last week and I was on edge the entire time. I have to hope that nine football games over the course of his life won’t have a negative impact on his health, but I can’t deny the absolute fear that I’ll have every minute that he’s on the field. — Amy Harkins, Columbus, OhioMy son didn’t ask to play football. I made him. He is a freshman, and I insisted that he play a fall sport in order to make his transition to high school easier. He is a big kid, not built for speed, so he is not cross-country or soccer material. He is built for football. His pediatrician believed, given today’s focus on head safety, football was no more dangerous than any other contact sport at this level — soccer, basketball, etc. And I agreed with him that football carried no more risk of injuries than soccer or lacrosse. — Carla Dauphin, Wilmington, Del. Concussions are a major concern and have kept my son out of playing tackle football. I’ve told him that if he were larger relative to his peers, I don’t think I would have the same problem with it. The last two years, I’ve been telling him to eat more and try to bulk up or get taller, but it hasn’t worked. — John Pisnanont, Ridgewood, N.J. The sport remains America’s most popular, but fewer children are turning out to play it, with participation falling nearly 5 percent since 2008, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. My 8-year-old is the tallest, strongest and most powerful kid in his class and on his soccer and baseball teams. If ever a kid were “built for football,” it is my son. My wife is a pediatric nurse who has worked in pediatric intensive care units, emergency departments, special procedure, and surgical units. She has seen the devastation a head injury can cause to a child, and to his or her parents. The fact that our son already struggles with dyslexia and mood disorders makes her even more fearful of what a brain injury could do to him. She is adamant that he will not play football. I view it as inevitable that he likely will, but we have agreed that we will not begin to entertain the discussion until he is at least 14 years old. We both kind of hope in the next few years he will develop different interests.I have loved watching football for years, but never played. It is something that my son and I enjoy doing together, rooting for the Packers and the Utah Utes. My love of the game has caused some conflict in terms of why he isn’t allowed to play. He doesn’t understand how I can love a game so much that I won’t let him play. — Matt Palmer, Salt Lake City My son, who has always excelled at soccer, has realized he’d also excel at football. His friends and physical education teachers have been trying to convince him to switch to football, and he wants to. He’d be an awesome wide receiver with his speed and athleticism. I have given him the option to be a field goal kicker, since it’s not unheard-of for them to be selected from the soccer team, but he wants touchdown glory. I had been considering wavering on my anti-football resolve, but the brain studies shut the door on that. I remind him that his brain is the best thing he has going for him. It has been difficult for me to tell my son that he can’t play football because he displays great talent for the sport. He’ll be a huge asset to the soccer team, but soccer games don’t fill the stands. I have to keep convincing myself I’m making the best decision I can. — Karen Kelly, Camillus, N.Y. Some states would like to suppress youth participation in tackle football even more. Five states have introduced legislation, with one bill — in New Jersey — remaining active. The first few weeks of youth football are spent just learning how to properly tackle to avoid head injury. Helmets are replaced every year. Coaches take concussion training. As long as my son enjoys being out there for any of his sports, he will do them. I read the studies, but it’s just a risk and a risk doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. We take risks every day. All fall we spend at the football fields; my 8-year-old plays and my two daughters cheer. It’s a family day at the fields. The organization is a feeling of community and it’s sad how many fewer kids we have playing every year. — Alaina Kenney, Mount Airy, Md. My 13-year-old will move on to high school football next year. He’s wanted to play as soon as he was 8 years old. You know your son loves to play football when he wakes up on Sundays and says, “Who am I going to crush today?”My son plays both ways on the line and he gets knocked around, but he’s been taught how to tackle the right way and I trust in his coaches and other coaches that they are teaching these kids the proper football techniques for less or no injury. — Amy Pennella, Greenwich, Conn.Correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this story misidentified the city where Amy Pennella lives. It’s Greenwich, Conn., not Saint Paul, Minn."
"When the four-team field for the College Football Playoff is determined, three programs will have had an outsize influence on the bracket: Louisiana State, Oklahoma State and Purdue.That might be appear to be a surprising list: None of those teams will make the playoff, their combined record is 21-15, and this past weekend — the final games before conference championships — the three teams went 1-2.Yet the final selection process — in which a committee considers several dozen teams from five major conferences (and five other ones seemingly, if unofficially, discounted from inclusion) and chooses four teams to play in the national semifinals on Dec. 29 — means that the fortunes of those three teams will be crucial in determining the field.When the selection committee releases its penultimate rankings Tuesday night, they will probably go like this: No. 1 Alabama (12-0), followed by Clemson (12-0), Notre Dame (12-0), Georgia (11-1), Oklahoma (11-1) and No. 6 Ohio State (11-1), which demolished Michigan (10-2) on Saturday.Notre Dame, which does not belong to a conference, is idle next weekend. It is almost impossible to believe one of college football’s most storied teams, after an undefeated season that included victories over four ranked teams, will be left out. Clemson, which has not played a close game since September, seems equally unlikely to lose to a Pittsburgh team that is 7-5 and was just throttled by Miami (7-5). And Alabama and Georgia will meet for the Southeastern Conference title, making it effectively a play-in game.That leaves one spot for as many as three teams: Oklahoma, which will meet Texas (9-3) in the Big 12 title game; Ohio State, which will face Northwestern (8-4) in the Big Ten title game; and the loser of Alabama-Georgia.And that is where L.S.U., Oklahoma State and Purdue come in.• L.S.U. gave Georgia its loss, 36-16 in Baton Rouge last month.• Oklahoma State has been the Big 12’s signature spoiler, defeating West Virginia (8-3) and Texas, and falling to Oklahoma by one point.• And Purdue dealt Ohio State its defeat, a 49-20 drubbing in West Lafayette, Ind., last month.The committee has said it looks at not only the number but also the quality of a team’s wins. It has slotted one-loss teams above an undefeated one (2014) and conference also-rans over conference champions (2016 and 2017).So this year, the committee will note that Purdue defeated just two other teams with winning records, and lost to Eastern Michigan, which finished 2-10 — and it may question what that says about Ohio State.It will have to consider Oklahoma State’s loss at home to Texas Tech (5-7) and wonder why Oklahoma struggled to beat the Cowboys.And it will ponder why Georgia lost by 20 to L.S.U., which was shut out by Alabama in Baton Rouge — and which just lost to Texas A&M (8-4).It is all a little absurd, though. Take L.S.U.: On Saturday night, the Tigers lost to Texas A&M at Kyle Field, dropping to 9-3. However — and leaving aside several questionable officiating decisions, such as an extremely generous pivotal ball spot that led to a first down — the fact is that the game required seven overtimes, ending 74-72. That technically made it the highest-scoring game in major college football history — in the same way, you might say, that the Aggies technically won. Had L.S.U.  managed to win that game in seven overtimes instead, the playoff makeup might look very different.The madness truly began Friday night, with two matchups that featured one of just a few remaining one-loss teams, as Oklahoma played West Virginia and Washington faced Washington State (10-1 entering Friday).The split-screen was striking. In Morgantown, W.Va., the Sooners and the Mountaineers were playing what might be termed Peak Big 12 football: The first four possessions ended in touchdowns, and the halftime score was 35-28. In the end, West Virginia quarterback Will Grier made too many mistakes, and Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray bolstered his Heisman Trophy argument with a 55-yard scamper to the end zone.At the same time, in Pullman, snowflakes fell onto the field, turning into large clumps of powder by the fourth quarter. Huskies running back Myles Gaskin gashed the Cougars’ defense for 170 yards and three touchdowns and Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew was kept in check as Washington won, 28-15.The starkly different styles in the two games — almost two different sports — made one wistful for the days when there was no organized attempt to tame college football’s intrinsic sprawl. Teams tried to win their conference, and if they did, they played in a corresponding bowl game. If they won that one, too, maybe they could tell their fans they had won the national title, and so could a couple of other teams.But college football, or at least its postseason, has been homogenized. The playoff attempts to corral these disparate teams, with their divergent styles and players, into a single bracket that can declare one champion to rule them all. It makes for great television and fun arguments.With one weekend left, it is almost over but the shouting. But the shouting is likely to last after it is over."

"With all of the trade drama surrounding Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis, the N.B.A. intruded on the N.F.L.’s run-up to the Super Bowl as we have not seen since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on football’s so-called Championship Sunday in 2006.Now that the Super Bowl is over and even more of North America’s sporting consciousness is there to be seized by professional basketball’s tireless headline-makers, here is our best advice: Buckle up.What follows is a by-the-numbers look at what the N.B.A.’s 73rd season has served up so far — and what the next five months hold.Through Sunday’s games, only the Milwaukee Bucks were on a 60-win pace. The Bucks’ Eastern Conference-leading record of 38-13 projects to a 61-win campaign — which could keep this season from being the league’s first since 2000-1 without a 60-win club.There are realistically 11 teams battling for the Western Conference’s eight playoff spots, after the new calendar year began with 14 teams in the conference — all but Phoenix — in the race. Dallas, New Orleans and Memphis have dropped off in January, prompting all three teams to focus more on trades than the standings.The consensus top three in the Most Valuable Player Award race coming out of Super Bowl weekend are Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Houston’s James Harden and Denver’s Nikola Jokic. According to the Basketball-Reference.com M.V.P. Award Tracker, Antetokounmpo awoke Sunday with a 37.8 percent chance of winning — far ahead of Harden’s 21.1 percent.Harden has scored at least 30 points in 26 consecutive games, good for the third-longest such streak in N.B.A. annals behind Wilt Chamberlain’s streaks of 65 and 31.The league’s trade deadline (Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern) is three days away. This is the second season since 1978-79 (as far back as reliable N.B.A. record-keeping goes) that the deadline falls before the All-Star Game.The New Orleans Pelicans have made two trips to the playoffs — winning only one series — in Davis’s first six seasons with the team. Davis requested a trade on Jan. 28.It took 54 days for the Minnesota Timberwolves to find a trade they liked for Jimmy Butler after Butler’s request to be dealt became public Sept. 18. Butler was snubbed by East coaches in All-Star voting, but the potential ceiling for Philadelphia’s rugged new star threesome was evident Thursday night at Golden State, when Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Butler and Company brought a halt to the longest winning streak of the season — after the Warriors had won 11 in a row.Minnesota is 21-18 since the trade that sent Butler and Justin Patton to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 — and 6-6 since firing Tom Thibodeau, the coach/team president who made it, on Jan. 6. Ryan Saunders, Thibodeau’s 32-year-old replacement, has many admirers around the league, but the Wolves are a long way from convincing skeptics that the deal (to bring in Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick) was sufficient for a player of Butler’s caliber.Thibodeau is one of three coaches to be fired this season — after nine coaching changes in the off-season. The other coaches to lose their jobs since opening night: Cleveland’s Tyronn Lue and Chicago’s Fred Hoiberg.There were 20 teams, entering Sunday’s play, attempting at least 30 3-pointers a game. This is poised to become the first season in N.B.A. history that the leaguewide average per game (31.4) will finish in the 30s.With coaches calling for more 3-pointers than ever before and greenlighting shots earlier and earlier in the 24-second shot clock — along with a new rule that resets the shot clock at 14 seconds on offensive rebounds — teams are averaging 100.0 possessions per 48 minutes leaguewide. The last N.B.A. season in which that figure finished in triple digits was 1988-89 (100.6).Milwaukee’s Khris Middleton, Orlando’s Nikola Vucevic, Philadelphia’s Simmons and Denver’s Jokic will make their All-Star Game debuts Feb. 17 in Charlotte, N.C. The All-Star player draft, in which the captains LeBron James and Antetokounmpo will fill out 13-man rosters by picking players playground-style, is Thursday at 7 p.m. — just four hours after the trade deadline passes. (D’Angelo Russell of the Nets, who was named later as a replacement for Indiana’s Victor Oladipo, who is injured, will also be making his All-Star debut this year.)Four teams are in contention for the league’s worst record: Phoenix (11-43), Cleveland (11-42), Chicago (12-41) and, of course, the Knicks (10-42). The teams that finish in the bottom three will share a 14 percent chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in June in the first year of the league’s revised lottery system.San Antonio sits a surprising fifth in the West, at 32-22, in its first season since trading Kawhi Leonard to Toronto in July. The Spurs are bidding for a record 22nd consecutive playoff berth, a streak that began in Gregg Popovich’s first full season as Spurs coach in 1997-98.At 27-25, Sacramento is on course to post its first winning record since the 2005-6 season. But the Kings will have to leapfrog at least two teams to stop the league’s longest playoff drought (12 seasons). The Suns (nine seasons) and the Orlando Magic (seven) are on course to extend their own playoff droughts.The Lakers’ playoff drought will hit a hard-to-believe six seasons in a row if James cannot save Los Angeles over its final 29 games. James just missed 17 consecutive games with a strained groin — the longest injury absence of his pro career — and is at risk for missing the postseason for the first time since his second N.B.A. season, in 2004-5.Carmelo Anthony finally became an unrestricted free agent on Sunday after clearing waivers nearly three months after the Houston Rockets sent him away in November after just 10 games together. The Rockets traded Anthony to Chicago on Jan. 21; the Bulls, who needed a roster spot, waived him Friday without him spending a single second with the team.In the seven games Golden State has deployed a lineup of DeMarcus Cousins, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, that group is averaging 127.1 points per 100 possessions in 54 minutes. Call it a small but ominous sample size.Oddsmakers in Las Vegas have the Warriors as overwhelming favorites to win their third consecutive championship and fourth in five seasons. According to ActionNetwork.com, Golden State is -225 to win it all, meaning that you would have to bet $225 to win $100. Boston, Milwaukee and Toronto are next in line at +1,000, meaning that a $100 bet would win $1,000 if any of those teams won the title.One scribe’s ranking of the top 10 players who could be unrestricted free agents July 1: Durant, Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Thompson, Butler, Kemba Walker, Cousins, Middleton, Marc Gasol and Tobias Harris.The N.B.A. playoffs start April 13."
"All five major conferences hold their championship games this weekend, setting the stage for Sunday, when the College Football Playoff selection committee will release its final rankings and determine the four-team playoff bracket.[College Football Playoff: Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Oklahoma are in.]Two of those games don’t really matter in terms of the committee’s decision. The Pacific-12 championship on Friday night between No. 10 Washington (9-3) and No. 17 Utah (9-3) does not feature a team with a realistic shot of making the national semifinals. The Atlantic Coast Conference game Saturday night, between No. 2 Clemson (12-0) and Pittsburgh (7-5), has in the Tigers a virtually assured winner and playoff shoo-in.Undefeated Notre Dame, which is an independent and idle this weekend, is also effectively a playoff lock.That leaves three games being played on Saturday whose outcomes will probably determine who else plays in the national semifinals, which this year will be contested in the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl on Saturday, Dec. 29. Here is a preview of each. (All times Eastern.)Noon, ABCThe Sooners have won several very tight games, including by 3 points at No. 15 West Virginia (8-3) last weekend and by 1 point versus Oklahoma State (6-6) last month. But with Heisman Trophy hopeful Kyler Murray leading the country’s top scoring offense (averaging more than 50 points per game), the Sooners have put up enough points to give themselves one of college football’s best records and a solid chance to make the playoff, in whose rankings they are currently fifth.[Read about Sooners quarterback Kyler Murray, whose future is in baseball.]First, though, they must win Saturday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex. They face the Longhorns, who, yes, are the team that handed Oklahoma its sole defeat this season, back in the Red River game in early October. Oklahoma’s defense will do its darnedest to stop Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger and his offensive weapons. But, like the first game — a 45-45 draw until the Longhorns kicked a field goal with seconds to spare — expect a shootout.Big 12 officials have said that Oklahoma players who taunt their opponents with a “horns down” hand gesture — an inversion of the pro-Texas “hook ‘em, horns” — may be flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. But although its referees are expected to strive for neutrality, conference officials may be rooting privately for the Sooners. Oklahoma must win for a shot at making the playoff; otherwise, the conference will be locked out of the bracket for the third time in five seasons.4 p.m., CBSThis is the second championship game that the Crimson Tide and the Bulldogs will contest in Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium in 2018. The first was for the national title, last January, when Alabama was shut out through the first half, until Coach Nick Saban made the momentous decision to bench his two-year starting quarterback in favor of a freshman backup.The rookie brought the Tide back and won the game in overtime with a dramatic, 41-yard touchdown pass. Neither Alabama nor that quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, has looked back. The Tide have won their games this season by an average of more than five touchdowns; their closest win was a 45-23 squeaker over No. 22 Texas A&M (8-4). Tagovailoa has thrown deep bombs to Alabama’s speedy receivers in a Heisman-worthy campaign.Georgia, coached by the former Saban defensive coordinator Kirby Smart, has looked nearly as dominant, with its sole loss a 36-16 defeat at No. 12 Louisiana State (9-3) in October. This will be the toughest defense Tagovailoa has faced, and therefore an opportunity to see if he is, in fact, mortal.Alabama’s presence in the game is largely academic: The Tide would most likely qualify for the playoff even with a loss. The Bulldogs, by contrast, could sure use a win to stay at No. 4 in the playoff rankings — although, were they to lose a close game to the theoretical best team in the country at a neutral site, might that be a good argument for them staying put?8 p.m., FoxAh, the Buckeyes and October road upsets. Last year, it was a drubbing at Iowa that kept them out of the playoff, despite victory in the annual conference title game in Indianapolis. This year, if the Buckeyes defeat the Wildcats at Lucas Oil Stadium and still fail to make the playoff, blame will fall on their 49-20 loss at Purdue (6-6) several weeks ago.This Buckeyes team actually might be worse than last year’s, as evidenced by razor-thin wins over mediocre teams like Nebraska and Maryland (which took its November game against Ohio State to overtime and might have won had the Terrapins quarterback not missed an open 2-point conversion pass). This despite the fact that under the sophomore quarterback Dwayne Haskins, Ohio State’s offense has been as explosive as ever, averaging more yards per game than any team other than Oklahoma.Ranked sixth by the selection committee, Ohio State, which played its first three games without suspended coach Urban Meyer, is not guaranteed a playoff spot if it wins; it is guaranteed not to get a playoff spot if it loses. Northwestern has nothing to lose and are on a comparative hot streak: after losing three of its first four — including at home to Akron — it won the rest of its games, minus a 31-21 defeat to Notre Dame.By the way, Northwestern also won its season opener … on the road at Purdue."
"MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — As a high school quarterback, Will Grier “fell in love” with Will Muschamp, then the coach at Florida. “He was a player’s coach, is what some people called it,” Grier said recently.Grier spurned other attractive offers — from Auburn, Arkansas and Tennessee — to commit to the Gators, and he enrolled early, in January 2014. He redshirted his first season. Then Muschamp was fired near the end of a 7-5 campaign.Grier persisted, and the next season he beat out Treon Harris for the starting job after the first game of the season. But in October 2015, Florida announced that Grier had tested positive for a banned substance; Grier, who said it had been in an over-the-counter supplement, was suspended for a year.The new Florida coach, Jim McElwain, told Grier that a change of scenery might benefit him. Grier agreed — particularly since the suggestion came from the new head coach.Three years later, Grier seems to have found a happy ending on the banks of the Monongahela River. He transferred to West Virginia, where he is in his second season as starting quarterback. The No. 12 Mountaineers (6-1) are College Football Playoff contenders, with a crucial Big 12 matchup at No. 15 Texas (6-2) on Saturday. And Grier, in his final year of college eligibility, could well be a first-round N.F.L. draft pick next spring.In college football’s highest tier, there are more and more transfers among quarterbacks, who — unlike offensive linemen, wide receivers or cornerbacks — have little opportunity to improve and virtually no hope of showing off their talents if they are not the starter.“People found an element in the system where they can kind of restart their careers,” said Yogi Roth, a Pac-12 Networks analyst and a former quarterbacks coach at Southern California.More than a dozen starting quarterbacks in the five power conferences have transferred. They include the Heisman Trophy contender Kyler Murray at Oklahoma and Joe Burrow, who will lead No. 4 Louisiana State (7-1) against No. 1 Alabama (8-0) on Saturday night. Four teams in the top 10 of the Associated Press poll, and seven of the top 25, are led by quarterbacks who transferred to those teams.In recent years, transfer quarterbacks have won the Heisman (Cam Newton, Baker Mayfield) and the national championship (Jake Coker). They have been No. 1 overall draft picks (Newton and Mayfield) and gone on to win a Super Bowl (Russell Wilson).Some have transferred as graduate students, exploiting a loophole that enables them to play immediately; others have sat out a year — N.C.A.A. rules require it for most football players who have not graduated — and still made productive use of their college careers.Other trends, such as early enrollment and year-round classes, mean that a quarterback can redshirt his first year, graduate in three years and then transfer and play immediately with two more seasons of eligibility.“It’s kind of like a free-agent market at this point,” said Ryan Willis, who transferred from Kansas to Virginia Tech, where he is now the starter.These transferred signal-callers have poked even more holes in the pretense that, for top players, college football is more than just pre-professional training.Grier, 23, is married, with a young daughter. He does not spend much time doing typical college-student activities or exploring Morgantown, he said. When he is not being a husband and father, he is working on football.“I treat this like my job,” he said. “I think it’s preparing me for the next day.”Coaches have largely embraced the trend — not that they have much choice.“I think it’s good when I get the good player,” said L.S.U. Coach Ed Orgeron, whose quarterback came from Ohio State. “When I lose the good player, I don’t like it.”Two rule changes in effect this season are likely to lead to more transfers, particularly at quarterback. Previously, transfers had to request a release from their team and were barred from direct contact with other coaches until they received it, creating a murky system of back-channel communication and uncertainty. Starting Oct. 15, they merely had to notify their team of their intention to transfer, after which their name would be put into a database and other coaches could reach out to them.Another new rule permits players to compete in up to four games and still redshirt that season. Clemson’s Kelly Bryant announced that he would transfer after this season’s fourth game — and after Coach Dabo Swinney announced that the freshman Trevor Lawrence would be the starter. Bryant, a senior, will be able to count 2018 as his redshirt year, even though he played substantial numbers of snaps in the Tigers’ first four games, and to play all of 2019.“This model of amateurism forces kids to take any means necessary to get noticed for the next level, because that’s the only way you can monetize that skill,” said Joel Klatt, a Fox Sports analyst and former college quarterback who outspokenly defended Bryant’s decision.Take Shea Patterson. He was recruited to Mississippi before the 2016 season, but his coach, Hugh Freeze, resigned amid scandal the following year, and the N.C.A.A. imposed sanctions on the Rebels near the end of 2017. “Some things were promised that didn’t happen,” Patterson said. As a result of the sanctions, the N.C.A.A. allowed players to transfer without having to sit out a season. After a visit from Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh in Oxford, Patterson now starts for the No. 5 Wolverines (7-1).Or take Grier. After Muschamp was fired, Grier seemed tied to McElwain, who had not recruited him and who generally uses run-first offenses. Instead, Grier was re-recruited by West Virginia Coach Dana Holgorsen, an offensive guru. Holgorsen and Jake Spavital, the offensive coordinator, have between them coached the future pro quarterbacks Case Keenum, Geno Smith and Johnny Manziel. They run a pass-happy Air Raid-style offense similar to those that produced the current N.F.L. starters Jared Goff, Patrick Mahomes and Mayfield.“I wanted to play in an offense where I could throw the ball a little bit and highlight my skills,” said Grier, who is among the leaders in completion percentage, touchdowns and quarterback rating this season.Transferring can be a touchy subject, because it appears to run counter to football’s ingrained team-first mentality and college athletics’ facade of sport mingled with, and subservient to, education.But more than one quarterback transfer noted that head and assistant coaches move between programs constantly, willingly and unwillingly, and without having to sit out a year.“The fact that coaches can come and go as they please and you get a whole new staff that you weren’t expecting and is trying to go in a different direction — you should have the ability to transfer,” Grier said.McElwain, for instance, was fired before the end of last season, meaning that if Grier had stayed put, he would have had three head coaches at one university.Bailey Hockman was recruited to play at Florida State under Jimbo Fisher, who had tutored Jameis Winston into winning a Heisman and being drafted with the No. 1 overall pick. But last off-season Fisher signed a $75 million contract with Texas A&M, and Hockman elected to transfer to a junior college with reported plans to play at North Carolina State.“Whether it’s college or the N.F.L., you have to make the right decision for yourself,” Patterson said. “Sometimes, you have to be selfish.”"
"Les Miles, the colorful former Louisiana State coach who led the Tigers to a national title in the 2007 season, will be the next coach at Kansas.It is a high-profile hire for Kansas’ football team, one of the rare power-conference programs overshadowed by its university’s men’s basketball team. While the Jayhawks basketball team — started by the sport’s founder, James Naismith — is a perennial power with three N.C.A.A. tournament championships, the football program has languished, averaging about 1.9 wins a season over the previous eight years.Miles’s “national reputation as a great recruiter and as a coach who student-athletes love playing for will enable us to break the cycle and return a winning tradition to the Kansas Jayhawks,” the athletic director, Jeff Long, said in a statement announcing the hiring on Sunday.This month, Long, who started at Kansas this year after 10 years at Arkansas, announced that the fourth-year coach David Beaty would not return after this season. The Jayhawks are 3-8 with one game remaining — a marked improvement over the last three seasons, in which they had a combined three wins.Miles, 65, had been considered the front-runner since the job opened up, especially after L.S.U. announced last week that it had settled a buyout of his contract. Long and Miles overlapped for three years at Michigan 30 years ago, when Long was a graduate assistant and administrator and Miles was an assistant under Bo Schembechler.Kansas made a similarly splashy football hire in 2012 with Charlie Weis, a former Notre Dame coach. But the team went 6-22 before he was fired early in his third season.In Miles, Kansas is again getting a known commodity — for better and for worse. Miles was hugely successful at L.S.U., going 114-34 with a national title in the 2007 season and a second title-game appearance four years later, but was let go after four games during the 2016 season. He was also Oklahoma State’s coach for four seasons.His colorful personality — known as the Mad Hatter because of his affinity for hats, he would pluck grass from Tiger Stadium’s turf and chomp on it during tense moments — endeared him to fans. However, Miles has been criticized for unorthodox game management and a stubborn refusal to adapt his conservative, Schembechler-esque offense for the current era of spread, pass-happy concepts. He recruited extraordinarily well, though L.S.U.’s status as a national power surely helped.Ultimately, Miles lost a few too many games to Alabama and Nick Saban, the Crimson Tide coach who had revived the Tigers as Miles’s immediate predecessor in Baton Rouge.Miles’s contract with Kansas, which could contain bonuses, is for five years with a base annual salary of $2.775 million, making him the lowest-paid coach in the Big 12 Conference.“We will bring Jayhawk Football back,” Miles said in a statement, “and we will do it with outstanding coaches, tremendous student-athletes of character and ability, and an unrelenting drive for excellence.”Aside from an Orange Bowl victory under Coach Mark Mangino after the 2007 season, though, the Jayhawks do not have much football tradition. The basketball team’s success largely compensated for many years of football woes, but the economics of college sports today make fielding a competitive football team all but imperative for even the biggest basketball universities.As a member of the Big 12, which lost several members to other leagues in the latest round of conference realignment, Kansas may feel a special burden to ramp up its fortunes in the most lucrative college sport. In the middle of the next decade, several college sports media contracts will expire, creating circumstances ripe for further realignment."
"Like the light glinting off his hundred-carat smile, Taye Diggs’s career has bounced all over the place: the loathsome yuppie landlord in “Rent,” his Broadway breakthrough; the pulse-quickening young Jamaican in “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” his film debut; and a succession of charismatic television professionals — most recently his Obama-esque mayoral candidate in “Empire,” who was killed off last season.“I go between wanting to put on a nice suit and talk a lot of words and then roll around and shoot guns and scream,” Mr. Diggs said.These days he’s taking on a national pastime, one with the power to both unite and divide.In “All American,” airing Wednesdays on CW, Mr. Diggs plays Billy Baker, a varsity football coach who lures Spencer James (Daniel Ezra), a star athlete and ace student from South Central Los Angeles onto his flailing Beverly Hills high school team. (The series is inspired by the life of the former N.F.L. linebacker Spencer Paysinger.)It’s a risky trade-off: In exchange for a gun-free zone and superior education, Spencer must jostle for position on a roster filled with resentment — not least from Billy’s son, Jordan (Michael Evans Behling).“All American” won’t duck the admiration and fury spurred by Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, and his protestation of police brutality and social injustice by kneeling during the national anthem, Mr. Diggs surmised.“The writers haven’t been shying away from that type of fodder when it comes to telling these stories,” he said. “Sports is something that usually brings people together, being the catalyst for thought and conversation. The fact that we’re dealing with all that, I think, bodes well for the show.”During a call from Los Angeles as he was driving Walker, his 9-year-old son with his ex-wife, his “Rent” co-star Idina Menzel, to basketball practice, Mr. Diggs, 47, talked about struggles with identity and lessons he might pass on to his child.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why “All American”?This one was very specifically poignant to what is happening today in this country, in society and also in my life. It deals with socioeconomics and race, sexuality and identities. Spencer moves in with my family, and I’m married to a white woman and have two biracial children. So everybody’s challenged when it comes to how they identify themselves and how other people identify them. And that’s something I’ve had to deal with being an African-American young man with an education, and people stereotyping me. There’s one line where in the show my son asks me if I think he’s black enough. And that really hit me hard because there were times in my life when I’ve asked myself and my mother that.Is football in your background?Just lightly, but I’ve always wanted the excuse to get a role that forced me to train. And for a cat at my age, coaching fits perfectly, because from watching these practices there’s no way I could get in those pads and do what these kids do.What are your thoughts about the player protest movement?At the end of the day, everything that’s happening is healthy for our United States of America, because it forces us to look at how united, if at all, we really are. And I think these are growing pains. I have my own opinions, but at the same time I want to make sure that I try really, really hard to listen to the other side and kind of empathize. So I think that’s going to be the lesson, that’s going to be the pill that we have to swallow, because that seems to be the thing that we need the most work on as a country regardless of who believes what.And Mr. Kaepernick’s Nike ad? It didn’t even hit me at first. I mean, I thought it was cool because I’ve been a fan of his from before all this, so I was like, “Great, I guess he’s not hurting for dough.” And then at the gym something was on TV where there was a controversy, and it forced me to actually think, “Oh wait, I’m forgetting what this cat represents to a lot of people.” I have no idea if Nike [executives] knew that it would be controversial, and they did it more for their attention to the money. But no matter how you cut it, for me it’s awesome.You’ve just directed a workshop of Keenan Scott II’s play “Thoughts of a Colored Man on a Day When the Sun Set Too Early.”I’ve choreographed, but as far as actually wielding the title of director, this is the first time and I’m having a ball. It’s inspired by the play “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf” by Ntozake Shange. So it’s a bunch of different perspectives of different kinds of African-American men from different walks of life, different upbringings, different backgrounds.You’ve said that you wondered as a young man whether you were black enough. Is that a discussion you anticipate having with your own son?I don’t know. He’s growing up in a different time. Everything that I got made fun of, he gets rewarded for. I was watching “2 Dope Queens,” two beautiful black women standing up for all things female and black, and they both had no issue talking about their white boyfriends. And in the time that I grew up, they would have gotten booed off the stage. But we’re in a day and age where it rolls off their tongues, and the audience laughs at the jokes, and that’s awesome. That’s the climate in which Walker is being raised in, and it’s all right with me. He’s in a classroom where a lot of the kids look like him; everybody is mixed with a little something. He’s going to have to deal with other issues — but he’s not going to deal with a lot of what I had to deal with."
"COLLEGE PARK, Md. — The University of Maryland football team burst onto the field before Saturday’s game against Michigan State and sprinted to the opposite end. Then the players knelt around a large “79” painted on the ground behind one end zone.It is a ritual they have repeated before each home game this season. In June, Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman who wore No. 79, died two weeks after collapsing during a team workout.But everything else about the past week was different: the conclusion of two separate investigations, one into McNair’s death and one into the football program’s culture under Coach D.J. Durkin; the reluctant decision on Tuesday by Wallace D. Loh, the university president — under heavy pressure from the Board of Regents — to reinstate Durkin from 80 days of administrative leave; and the near-universal condemnation from students, the news media and state lawmakers of that decision.Then came Loh’s reversal and firing of Durkin on Wednesday, and the resignation of James T. Brady, the board chairman, on Thursday.On Saturday, Maryland looked like a football team suffering under the weight of the previous week. It looked like a football team whose head coach had been reinstated, led a day of practices, and then been fired, all within 24 hours. It looked like a team whose players were compelled to spend the week ensuring some measure of justice for their dead friend and teammate.Michigan State scored on its first two drives of the game and went ahead, 10-0, on its way to an easy 24-3 victory. Maryland gained only 8 yards in the first quarter and 100 in the game. Its standout player was punter Wade Lees, who averaged 45 yards on eight punts. But as more evidence of the program’s rough stretch, he had been involved in a scuffle involving teammates after practice during the week that resulted in a call to the police.Maryland’s last, best chance at a victory on Saturday came with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter, down, 17-3. Maryland defensive lineman Byron Cowart intercepted Rocky Lombardi’s pass and was rumbling toward a touchdown, but just before the end zone, the ball was chopped out of his arms for a touchback.On the next play, Michigan State scored on an 80-yard run.“We are right there playing one of the top programs in the nation, certainly one of the top programs in our league, and we’re that far away from it being 17-10,” Maryland’s interim head coach, Matt Canada, said after the game.Canada blamed himself for the loss, repeatedly saying he needed to coach better, and acknowledged it had been a tough week. “This week was a challenging week,” he said. “That is a fact. You guys all know that.”Because of the tumult, the Maryland players were offered the option of bypassing a customary postgame availability with the news media, Dustin Semonavick, an assistant athletic director said, and they chose to wait until after Tuesday’s practice to speak.The mood on campus was muted before the game, though that could have been because of the cold November wind whipping through College Park.A few hundred students dutifully carried bags of beer cans to the Greek life tailgate, and a smattering of fans lined the entrance to the west gate two hours before kickoff to welcome the Terrapins’ team bus. Besides some vigorous clapping directed at the interim head coach, there was little to suggest anything other than a typical Maryland football game.The 51,802 capacity Maryland Stadium was two-thirds full — the team’s regular attendance this season — and the small student section seemed to evaporate as the Maryland offense sputtered and the Spartans ran away with the game.Many students in attendance supported Loh’s decision to fire Durkin, if not the convoluted process that led to it.“There is basically a general consensus among students that it was a good decision to fire the coach,” said the freshman Arno Babcock, 18. “Everybody loves President Loh.”Babcock’s friend Benjamin Horton, also an 18-year-old freshman, concurred, and said he hoped that the scrutiny of Maryland’s football program would both ensure the safety of its players going forward and perhaps that of football players at other colleges, too.“It is a good wake-up call to show across the whole United States the culture behind football practices and coaches and how they treat their players,” Horton said.Allison Kinzer, a 23-year-old student, said Durkin’s firing forestalled campus protests, and she questioned why he was reinstated in the first place.“They should’ve never hired him back,” she said. “If they would’ve kept him, it would’ve been a disaster.”Maryland opened the season with an impressive victory over then-No. 23 Texas, but as has been the norm since it joined the Big Ten five years ago, the team has struggled in conference play. Saturday’s loss dropped Maryland’s conference record to 3-3, with games against ranked Ohio State and Penn State to come.Maryland last had a winning record in 2013, its final season in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Traditionally a basketball school, Maryland was a member of the basketball-mad A.C.C. for 60 years.Joining the football-heavy Big Ten has been blamed in part for the hard-charging culture that led to McNair’s death and the reluctance of the Board of Regents to recommend that Loh fire Durkin, despite a pedestrian 10-15 record in his first two seasons.Reminders of the Big Ten are almost as ubiquitous in Maryland Stadium as the logo of Under Armour, the sports apparel manufacturer founded by an alumnus, the football booster Kevin A. Plank. The conference logo is painted on the field — just yards away from two smaller “79” reminders of McNair. And over the west gate, Big Ten flags fly just below those of the state of Maryland."
"At modern American universities, it is not unusual that the head football coach is the most powerful, and the highest-paid, individual.That has rarely been more clear than it was on Tuesday, when the governing board at the University of Maryland looking into the death of a football player allowed the head coach and athletic director to keep their jobs, while accepting the unexpected retirement of the school’s president, Wallace D. Loh.The decision was an attempt to put an end to a controversy that began on May 29 when the player, Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman, suffered heatstroke in a hard-charging practice. He died two weeks later.Mr. McNair’s death spurred two investigations, an ESPN report that revealed a “toxic culture” of bullying and humiliating players, and a decision to put the football coach and members of his staff on administrative leave.The announcement that the head football coach, D. J. Durkin, and the athletic director, Damon Evans, would keep their jobs immediately raised the question of whether the university was putting its quest to succeed in big-time football ahead of accountability for its players’ well-being.At a news conference Tuesday, Mr. McNair’s father, Marty McNair, said of the decision, “I feel like I’ve been punched in the stomach and somebody spit in my face.”The head of the Board of Regents, James T. Brady, defended the program on Tuesday, but he did say that problems had festered because “too many players feared speaking out.”That was also the conclusion of a report commissioned by the university to look into the athletic department. But, Mr. Brady said, the report found “no direct link between the administrative dysfunction” and Mr. McNair’s death.In a statement released by the university, Mr. Durkin said he was “grateful for the opportunity to rejoin the team and very much appreciate having the support of the Board of Regents.”“As we move forward, I am confident that our team will successfully represent the entire University in a positive way both on and off the field,” the statement added.The board recommended that Mr. Durkin and Mr. Evans remain on staff because, Mr. Brady said, they deserved a chance to fix the department. In August, Mr. Loh said he accepted “legal and moral responsibility” for Mr. McNair’s death.For months, it had seemed that Mr. Durkin’s job was in jeopardy; he was put on administrative leave in August, though Mr. Evans was not.On Tuesday, Mr. Brady called Mr. Durkin a “good man” and a “good coach” who had been “unfairly blamed.”The decision to keep Mr. Durkin underlined the importance of a top football program at a university like Maryland, which decided in 2012 to move from the Atlantic Coast Conference to the Big Ten, among the most competitive and highest-profile conferences in the country for football.The move allowed Maryland — traditionally a basketball university — to significantly increase the amount of money it takes in from the sale of its media rights and to experience annual football showdowns with powerhouse teams like Michigan and Ohio State.Mr. Loh, 72, who became president in 2010, enthusiastically pursued the move to the Big Ten. After the football team struggled during its first two seasons in the conference, in 2014 and 2015, the administration set out to find an outstanding young coach to build a program that could compete with the best teams in the country.It landed on Mr. Durkin, now 40, who had quickly risen through college football’s coaching ranks. Before his 30th birthday, he had been an assistant at Stanford under Jim Harbaugh. He then worked at Florida under Urban Meyer, the current Ohio State coach, then reunited with Mr. Harbaugh at Michigan, where, as the defensive coordinator, he oversaw one of the country’s best units.In December 2015, Mr. Durkin signed a five-year, $12.5 million contract with Maryland. His task was not a simple one: to make Maryland competitive after decades of mediocrity and structural disadvantages. He had Mr. Loh’s full support — until the months after Mr. McNair’s death.When Mr. McNair died in June, Mr. Evans was the interim athletic director; he assumed the job as the permanent athletic director later that month. Mr. Durkin, now in his third full season, is still relatively new in the job. According to the board and the report, those were factors in the decision to allow both men to keep their jobs, Mr. Brady said.Some local and state politicians were quick to assail the board’s decision.In a statement, Rushern L. Baker, III, the Prince George’s County Executive, noted that he and Mr. Loh had begun their tenures as top officials around the same time, and said Mr. Loh had “done more to unite the University with the County in his eight years than his predecessors over the preceding decades.”“Today’s decision by the University System of Maryland Regents was very disappointing,” the statement continued. “It is a shame that they appear to have put the short-term interest of building the university’s football program ahead of continuing the progress of Maryland’s flagship university.”In a telephone interview, Mr. Baker went further, calling the board’s action “appalling.”“The one person that’s leaving the university is the only person who stood up and took responsibility” for Mr. McNair’s death, Mr. Baker said. Mr. Loh, he added, “showed the moral courage that we want a leader to have.”Some Maryland football players also weighed in via social media. On Twitter, offensive lineman Ellis McKennie issued a veiled criticism “of people do not have the courage to hold anyone accountable” for his teammate’s death. Linebacker Tre Watson quoted McKennie’s tweet and added that “Accountability is something people apparently struggle too much with and yet it doesn’t hurt them.”For his part, Mr. Loh deflected questions regarding his feelings about the decision to keep both men in their jobs. He declined even to name Mr. Durkin, only indirectly confirming that the coach and Mr. Evans would keep their jobs by saying that he had accepted the board’s recommendations. In his resignation letter, he reiterated his acceptance of responsibility and said “the past several months have been exceedingly difficult for the university, Maryland football, and all who support the Terps following the tragic death of Jordan McNair.”Mr. Loh added, “We need to have a football culture that is healthy, that has the well-being and the welfare of student athletes foremost, a culture that reflects the values of this institution, respect for human dignity, for the success of student-athletes, and they can be motivated to perform at the highest levels, but do it in a way that ensures their success and respects their dignity.”The report, conducted by a commission of eight appointees — three picked by Mr. Loh, five chosen by the board — with the aid of the law firm DLA Piper, was cast as a broader look into the culture under Mr. Durkin.It also rejected the ESPN report’s characterization of the program, which also mentioned Rick Court, the strength and conditioning coach under Mr. Durkin.“If the culture had been ‘malicious or harmful,’” the report stated, citing a definition of the word “toxic,” “Mr. Durkin would not have earned the loyalty and respect of many of his student-athletes and coaches. Many players interviewed by the commission felt Mr. Durkin’s and Mr. Court’s coaching tactics reflected those of a ‘big-time football program.’”But the commission did characterize Mr. Durkin as essentially in over his head. He is a first-time head coach at a program that is attempting to bolster its status and compete with the best teams in college football without the proper support.“The Athletics Department provided little education around, or support to handle, the myriad administrative responsibilities of a head coach, tasks Mr. Durkin had not been delegated in previous jobs as a coordinator or position coach,” the board’s report stated.He was put on administrative leave nearly two months after Mr. McNair’s death, after the publication of the ESPN article on Aug. 10. Mr. Court resigned in August.The commission blamed Mr. Court for inappropriate behavior that included “challenging a player’s manhood and hurling homophobic slurs (which Mr. Court denies but was recounted by many),” as well as “throwing food, weights, and on one occasion a trash can full of vomit” at players, while others watched.Finally, the commission criticized the university leadership, up to and including Mr. Loh, for not creating a sturdy organizational flowchart — it was never clear to whom Mr. Court reported — and for allowing a rift between Mr. Evans and the previous athletic director, Kevin Anderson, to dominate the athletic department and contribute to its descent into chaos.“There was no formal mechanism to assess coaching performance,” the report said. “There was not a single performance review for Mr. Court during his tenure at Maryland. The Athletics Department’s compliance office lacked a system to track complaints.”An earlier report conducted by an outside consultant focused on the medical circumstances surrounding Mr. McNair’s death. It found that more than an hour had elapsed between when Mr. McNair began showing symptoms of heatstroke and when 911 was called. It added that cold-water immersion, a standard treatment, was not used.That report appeared to place greater blame for the death on the training staff than on the coaching staff. Two members of that staff have been placed on leave, in addition to Mr. Court’s resigning.The Terrapins went 10-15 the past two seasons, with a conference record of 5-13.This season, with offensive coordinator Matt Canada as the interim head coach, Maryland is 5-3 over all and 3-2 in the conference. Mr. Durkin returned to practice Tuesday and is expected to coach the team on Saturday against Michigan State — a decision Mr. Loh said would be up to Mr. Evans."
"Led by a second-year head coach with a lot to prove, Texas entered the annual Red River game in Dallas as a decided underdog against undefeated Oklahoma. The Longhorns proceeded to eke out victory, prompting the hopeful thought among those who wear orange that, after several years in the college football wilderness, Texas finally was back.Sound familiar? It’s a description of the 2015 rivalry game, in which Charlie Strong’s players carried him off the field after the 24-17 win. Thirteen months and a couple weeks later, Strong was out, replaced by Tom Herman. Saturday he coached Texas to a thrilling 48-45 victory over the Sooners.The situations are different. The 2015 win improved Texas’s record to just 2-4; the game remained the high point of a forgettable year. This year’s Longhorns are 5-1, undefeated in conference play and ranked ninth in the latest Associated Press poll. (Oklahoma dropped to 5-1, and from seventh to 11th).But the parallels should serve as a good reminder, as we approach this season’s midpoint: opening weeks can be deceptive.Texas, which started the season slow — losing to Maryland and defeating Tulsa unconvincingly — may be ill-equipped to survive the rest of its season unscathed, since it still has a road game at Texas Tech (3-2). Oklahoma’s offense, meanwhile, led by quarterback Kyler Murray, remains amply functional, while the defense that surrendered 45 points is about to get an overhaul with the reported firing of defensive coordinator Mike Stoops. Don’t count out the Sooners yet.Then there is Florida. With a 27-19 home win over formerly undefeated Louisiana State (which fell from No. 5 to No. 13), the Gators are 5-1 and ranked 14th. Maybe Florida is for real. Or maybe this will be like recent years, all of which saw Florida ranked highly at one point (eighth, 10th, 17th) only to end considerably lower (25th, 14th, unranked). It is probably reasonable to expect Florida to struggle in its first year under new head coach Dan Mullen, even if Saturday’s performance is a case for longer-term optimism.In Gainesville the Gator faithful are excited, though, and why not? The period from September into mid-October, thick with springing hope and irrational exuberance, has its charms. In fact, it is reminiscent of college football’s decades before the unified postseason inevitably pivoted each season’s narrative toward its endgame.That may have been a more innocent time, when fans could be unequivocally happy for teams that merely had surprising starts, or surprising but imperfect seasons, or even mediocre seasons in which they nonetheless beat their rivals.For instance, the mood in Lexington was most likely muted this week after Kentucky ruined its 5-0 start — its best in a decade — in an overtime loss at No. 22 Texas A&M (4-2). But fans of the No. 18 Wildcats should thrill to its meaningful October game under Kyle Field’s lights. They can hope for the best when they host No. 2 Georgia (6-0) next month and otherwise do what they always do: invest their national title hopes in the men’s basketball team.Similarly, when No. 19 Colorado, which is 5-0 against teams that are a combined 5-17 (plus lower-tier New Hampshire), sustains its first loss — — the feeling in Boulder will probably be similar. That loss could happen next week at Southern California (3-2), or the week after at No. 7 Washington (5-1).But perhaps that is the wrong approach. Colorado already has as many wins as it did all of last season. And yet fans are trained now to think playoff or bust.In terms of the four-team College Football Playoff, this season looks really tricky right now, with No. 5 Notre Dame (6-0) and even No. 10 Central Florida (5-0) threatening to occupy precious spots. For the teams that maintain realistic playoff aspirations, what are the big upcoming contests? Here is one for each remaining week of the season (and one week with two).Oct. 13: No. 15 Wisconsin (5-1) vs. No. 12 Michigan (5-1). Even though the Badgers are likely to make their third straight Big Ten title game no matter the outcome, neither contender can afford a second loss.Oct. 20: No. 20 North Carolina State (5-0) vs. No. 4 Clemson (6-0). This game is the last best hope for Clemson to lose before the playoff, which could substantially change the overall picture in December. —.Oct. 27: No. 2 Georgia (6-0) vs. No. 14 Florida (5-1). The Bulldogs and the Gators will, as always, play their annual game (known as the World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party) in Jacksonville. But this year features one of the more exciting recent seasons for the Southeastern Conference’s East Division. The loser — particularly if it is Florida, which has already lost to Kentucky — could be shut out of the conference championship game and the playoff.Nov. 3: No. 6 West Virginia (5-0) vs. No. 9 Texas (5-1). The Big 12 rematches its two best contenders in its conference title game. But teams without a date against the titans Georgia, Clemson, No. 3 Ohio State (6-0) or No. 1 Alabama (6-0) probably cannot survive so much as one late-season loss.Nov. 3: No. 1 Alabama (6-0) vs. No. 13 Louisiana State (5-1). Yes, these two. It is slightly incredible to think that, as Alabama’s head coach, Nick Saban had a losing record against Louisiana State — 2-3 — before the 2011 national championship game. Including the Crimson Tide’s 21-0 win there, Alabama has won the last seven. As insurance against another juggernaut Georgia team, Alabama should really try for an undefeated regular season.Nov. 10: No. 8 Penn State (4-1) vs. No. 15 Wisconsin (5-1). The Nittany Lions’ postseason prospects are contingent on running the table as impressively as possible after last month’s near win against Ohio State. Particularly if the Badgers win at Michigan this Saturday, their trip to Madison will be crucial.Nov. 17: No. 25 Cincinnati (6-0) vs. No. 10 Central Florida (5-0). Last season, Central Florida notoriously declared itself “national champion” after going 12-0 and then defeating Auburn in the Peach Bowl. But if this season the Knights want people outside the Orlando-Kissimmee metropolitan area to agree, they will need luck, probably a Notre Dame loss, the playoff committee’s dispensation and, most of all, no losses. Along with the following week’s game at No. 23 South Florida (5-0), this will be their toughest test.Nov. 23: No. 7 Washington (5-1) vs. Washington State (5-1). After Stanford’s second loss, the final chance for the Pacific-12 not to be locked out of the playoff for a second consecutive year — and three of five — is for the Huskies to win all their remaining games. This very much includes the post-Thanksgiving Apple Cup, which this season is in Pullman against Coach Mike Leach’s curiously unranked Cougars.Dec. 1 (potentially): No. 1 Alabama (6-0) vs. No. 2 Georgia (6-0) How consequential will this SEC conference championship game be? It’s a potential rematch of last season’s national title game (in the same Atlanta stadium to boot), featuring the current top-two teams.Actually, if both the Bulldogs and the Crimson Tide enter December undefeated, their game may matter not very much — they may both be shoo-ins. But if it features a clear favorite and a clear underdog, and the favorite wins, that could make room for one more spot in the final bracket — a spot that undefeated Notre Dame, undefeated Central Florida or the Big 12 champion would be glad to have for itself."
"Jason Witten, the ironman Dallas Cowboys tight end who retired from the N.F.L. and joined “Monday Night Football” last year, announced Thursday that he would return to the team. By the time the season starts, he will be 37.“The fire inside of me to compete and play this game is just burning too strong,” Witten said in a statement. “This team has a great group of rising young stars, and I want to help them make a run at a championship. This was completely my decision, and I am very comfortable with it. I’m looking forward to getting back in the dirt.”The Cowboys were 10-6 last season with a wild-card playoff win. But their top tight end, Blake Jarwin, had only 307 receiving yards. Dallas missed the playoffs in Witten’s last season.When Witten retired in May, he said of his decision, “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.”He made 11 Pro Bowls, including the one in his final season, and caught 1,152 passes for 12,448 yards, both Cowboys records. He ranks fourth in the N.F.L. in career catches behind Jerry Rice, Tony Gonzalez and Larry Fitzgerald. He was also known as a strong run blocker.Though he played 16 games in every season except his first, his statistics dipped in his final years. In his last season, he had 63 catches and 560 yards receiving, the lowest figures since his rookie season.Witten signed a four-year, $29.6 million contract extension with the Cowboys in 2017 but retired just one year later and joined a reimagined “Monday Night Football” booth on ESPN. He worked alongside Joe Tessitore, the play-by-play voice; Anthony McFarland, an analyst; and Lisa Salters, who reported from the sidelines.ESPN had hoped to replicate the magic happening at CBS. A year earlier, CBS had hired Witten’s quarterback with the Cowboys, Tony Romo, and made him the network’s lead football analyst. Romo was an instant hit and received near-universal praise for his ability to predict plays.But from the start, the Tessitore, McFarland and Witten booth struggled. Witten often stumbled over his lines — his most notable moment was when he said that the N.F.L. had gone “left wing” in its protection of quarterbacks — and sometimes spoke in platitudes. McFarland, instead of sitting in the broadcast booth, provided commentary from an odd cranelike contraption on the sideline that ESPN called the Booger Mobile.Witten’s performance was savaged by sports media critics, who wondered how long ESPN would keep the booth together. “‘Monday Night Football’ has a big problem: Jason Witten,” read one Boston Globe headline. Witten and Jay Rothman, the show’s producer, asked for patience, and Rothman insisted Witten’s job was safe.In a statement Thursday, ESPN thanked Witten for his contributions and said, “We understand Jason’s desire to return to the Dallas Cowboys.”ESPN said its plans for the 2019 “Monday Night Football” booth had not been determined."
"Brett Kavanaugh’s page in his high school yearbook offers a glimpse of the teenage years of the man who is now President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee: lots of football, plenty of drinking, parties at the beach. Among the reminiscences about sports and booze is a mysterious entry: “Renate Alumnius.”The word “Renate” appears at least 14 times in Georgetown Preparatory School’s 1983 yearbook, on individuals’ pages and in a group photo of nine football players, including Judge Kavanaugh, who were described as the “Renate Alumni.” It is a reference to Renate Schroeder, then a student at a nearby Catholic girls’ school.Two of Judge Kavanaugh’s classmates say the mentions of Renate were part of the football players’ unsubstantiated boasting about their conquests.“They were very disrespectful, at least verbally, with Renate,” said Sean Hagan, a Georgetown Prep student at the time, referring to Judge Kavanaugh and his teammates. “I can’t express how disgusted I am with them, then and now.”Judge Kavanaugh’s years at Georgetown Prep, in a Maryland suburb of Washington, are under intense scrutiny because of allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her during high school. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. He and Dr. Blasey are scheduled to testify Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[Read our story debunking 5 viral rumors about Kavanaugh’s accusers.]Judge Kavanaugh’s peers have given different accounts of what he was like. But his yearbook provides a contemporaneous glimpse of the elite Catholic school’s hard-drinking atmosphere — Judge Kavanaugh’s personal page boasts, “100 kegs or bust” — and a culture that some describe as disrespectful to women.This month, Renate Schroeder Dolphin joined 64 other women who, saying they knew Judge Kavanaugh during their high school years, signed a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is weighing Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. The letter stated that “he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect.”When Ms. Dolphin signed the Sept. 14 letter, she wasn’t aware of the “Renate” yearbook references on the pages of Judge Kavanaugh and his football teammates.“I learned about these yearbook pages only a few days ago,” Ms. Dolphin said in a statement to The New York Times. “I don’t know what ‘Renate Alumnus’ actually means. I can’t begin to comprehend what goes through the minds of 17-year-old boys who write such things, but the insinuation is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue. I pray their daughters are never treated this way. I will have no further comment.”Alexandra Walsh, a lawyer for Judge Kavanaugh, said in a statement: “Judge Kavanaugh was friends with Renate Dolphin in high school. He admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day.“Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event,” the statement continued. “They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.”Ms. Dolphin said she had never kissed Judge Kavanaugh. “I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,” she said through her lawyer.In an interview on Fox News on Monday, Judge Kavanaugh defended his high school behavior in general terms. “People might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school — I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit,” he said.[Read more about the Fox New interview on Monday.]A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, declined to comment beyond the statement from Judge Kavanaugh’s lawyer.Four of the men who were pictured with Judge Kavanaugh in a photo captioned “Renate Alumni” said it was simply a reference to their dating or going to dances with Ms. Dolphin.An elite Catholic boys’ high school founded in 1789, Georgetown Prep has many alumni who have gone into public service. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch of the Supreme Court is a graduate, as is Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.Judge Kavanaugh, a member of the football team and the captain of the basketball team, played a prominent role in Georgetown Prep’s firmament in the early 1980s. The school’s culture was one of heavy drinking and at times insensitivity.The 1983 yearbook, for example, includes multiple apparent references to the Ku Klux Klan (but not on Judge Kavanaugh’s page). His page, in addition to the “Alumnius” entry, mentions his role as “treasurer” of the “Keg City Club.”“The vast majority of the time I spent in high school was studying or focused on sports and being a good friend to the boys and the girls that I was friends with,” he told Fox News on Monday.Some of Judge Kavanaugh’s high school peers said there was a widespread culture at the time of objectifying women.“People claiming that they had sex with other people was not terribly unusual, and it was not terribly believable,” said William Fishburne, who was in Judge Kavanaugh’s graduating class and was a manager for the football team. “Not just Brett Kavanaugh and his particular group, but all the classmates in general. People would claim things they hadn’t done to sort of seem bigger than they were, older than they were.”Bill Barbot, who was a freshman at Georgetown Prep when Judge Kavanaugh was a senior, said Judge Kavanaugh and his clique were part of the school’s “fratty” culture. “There was a lot of talk and presumably a lot of action about sexual conquest with girls,” Mr. Barbot said.Ms. Dolphin was a subject of that braggadocio, according to Mr. Hagan and another classmate, who requested anonymity because he fears retribution. They said Judge Kavanaugh and his friends were seeking to memorialize their supposed conquests with the “Renate” yearbook references.“She should be offended,” Mr. Hagan said of Ms. Dolphin. “I was completely astounded when I saw she signed that letter” on Judge Kavanaugh’s behalf.Some women who knew Judge Kavanaugh at the time defended his conduct.“These guys weren’t any different than other boys high schools across the country,” said Suzanne Matan, a friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s from their high school days. “And I chose to hang out with those boys and many other girls did, too, because they were fun, and they were safe, and they were respectful.”The Georgetown Prep yearbook’s personal pages were designed and written by the individual students, according to alumni. A faculty adviser reviewed the pages.Judge Kavanaugh was one of 13 graduating seniors who referred to Ms. Dolphin in some way on their personal pages. Some gave themselves titles — DeLancey Davis, for example, listed himself as “chairman of the Bored” of the “Renate Club.” Another football player, Tom Kane, mentioned on his page “Renate’s Suicide Squad.”The group photo, with Judge Kavanaugh and eight fellow football players in pads and uniform, grinning, was captioned “Renate Alumni.” Mark Judge, the commentator and author who has written about his alcohol-fueled years at Georgetown Prep, stands next to Judge Kavanaugh in the photo.Barbara Van Gelder, a lawyer for Mr. Judge, declined to comment.Four of the players in the “Renate Alumni” photo — Mr. Davis, Mr. Kane, Tim Gaudette and Don Urgo Jr. — said in a statement that they had “never bragged about” sexual contact or anything like that with Ms. Dolphin. The statement, issued by Jim McCarthy, a public-relations representative, said the yearbook’s “Renate” references “were intended to allude to innocent dates or dance partners and were generally known within the community of people involved for over 35 years.”“These comments,” the statement continued, “were never controversial and did not impact ongoing relationships until The Times twisted and forced an untrue narrative. This shabby journalism is causing egregious harm to all involved, particularly our friend, and is simply beneath contempt.”Michael Walsh, another Georgetown Prep alumnus, also listed himself on his personal yearbook page as a “Renate Alumnus.” Alongside some song lyrics, he included a short poem: “You need a date / and it’s getting late / so don’t hesitate / to call Renate.”Mr. Walsh, a bank executive in Virginia, was one of scores of Georgetown Prep alumni who signed a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee leaders vouching for Judge Kavanaugh’s “sharp intellectual ability, affable nature, and a practical and fair approach devoid of partisan purpose.” He did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Dolphin was aware that members of Judge Kavanaugh’s clique were reciting that poem, according to a person familiar with her thinking. She told the football players that she found it offensive, believing it made her seem like a cheap date, and she asked them to stop.Some of Judge Kavanaugh’s peers said they doubted that the yearbook notations were good-natured. “Those guys weren’t big on crushes,” Mr. Fishburne said. “I think they felt that if a girl didn’t want to date them, then they must be gay. I’m serious.”A high school friend of Ms. Dolphin’s, who also signed the letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that while she stood by the letter’s contents, as a friend of Ms. Dolphin’s she was “sickened” by the yearbook’s “Renate” references. She and a second friend of Ms. Dolphin’s denied that there was any sexual contact between Ms. Dolphin and Judge Kavanaugh or anyone else in his circle."
"The chairman of the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents announced his resignation Thursday, a stunning turnabout barely 48 hours after the board recommended that the University of Maryland’s head football coach D. J. Durkin be retained — a decision that the university’s president overturned a day later.The board came under heavy and widespread criticism after the chairman, James T. Brady, and the university’s president, Wallace D. Loh, announced on Tuesday that Mr. Durkin would stay on despite the death of one of his players, who experienced heatstroke during a practice in the spring, and a report detailing cultural problems in the football program.In a statement, Mr. Brady said that he had become an untenable distraction. “I have become the public face of both the board and its decisions related to these matters,” he said.In a separate statement, the board acknowledged that Mr. Loh had ultimately rejected its recommendation to retain Mr. Durkin when he fired him on Wednesday. At the news conference on Tuesday announcing that the coach would stay, Mr. Loh said he accepted the board’s recommendation, but he was visibly unenthusiastic about the decision. Mr. Loh also announced that he would retire at the end of the academic year.A day later, Mr. Loh reversed course and fired Mr. Durkin.“Last night, President Loh informed the chancellor of his plan to terminate Mr. Durkin’s contract,” the board’s statement on Thursday said. “The board acknowledges and accepts his decision and his authority to make it.”Mr. Brady’s resignation deepened the fallout from the death of Jordan McNair, 19, in June and the board’s recommendation that Mr. Durkin be retained. A report commissioned by the university, published this week, partially blamed Mr. Durkin for a dysfunctional culture at the Maryland football program, but it found “no direct link between the administrative dysfunction and Mr. McNair’s death.”The initial decision to retain Mr. Durkin drew condemnation from politicians, students and others across the country and in College Park, Md., where many saw the decision as an example of the prioritizing of big-time athletics over students’ safety. Among those urging the board to reconsider were Maryland’s governor and his opponent in next week’s election; the former Maryland university system chancellor and the former Board of Regents chairman; and the current undergraduate student government president.Campus academic leaders signed a letter Thursday expressing their “dismay and deep concern” for what they characterized as the board’s inappropriate interference in campus affairs.In his statement, Mr. Brady acknowledged how the initial decision to retain Mr. Durkin had been received.“I respect the many people — including elected leaders, members of the public and members of the board — who disagreed with the recommendations a majority of this board ultimately made,” he said.He added: “I understand that reasonable people could come to other conclusions. And even among our board, some did.”"
"TERRE HAUTE, Ind. — Jake Bain’s dorm room is a typical college crash pad, right down to the rumpled bedsheets and hampers overflowing with dirty laundry. Less common, for a space shared by two Division I football players, is the photo collage taped above his bed: Jake and his boyfriend kissing at their high school graduation; a romantic selfie of Jake resting his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder; the young couple holding hands at sunset.The Indiana State University athlete’s very public coming out last fall — during a 13-minute speech inside an auditorium to his entire Missouri high school — was an act that continues to shape his life in ways he could not have imagined back then.“If a future Division 1 football player can be openly gay,” Jake, at the time the popular square-jawed captain of the John Burroughs high school football team, said to those who had assembled, “then so can you.”With that speech, in which he implored his classmates to be themselves, Jake became an accidental activist determined to change the national conversation about gay youths. His sharpest weapon? Social media, where he receives as many as 50 messages a week from as far away as Australia and from teenagers in countries where it is illegal to be gay.His life, as it unfolds on the football field and before nearly 13,500 Instagram followers, has inspired many others to come out, their own stories often left in comments on his page. It also has been the focus of taunts and protests, as recently as this month. But Jake’s narrative, at turns harrowing and triumphant, is playing out in heartland towns and conservative state universities across the country, as gay and transgender teenagers emboldened by the power of social media are stepping into the limelight and demanding acceptance and equality.“Show everyone that it is O.K. to be who you want to be, to love who you want to love,” Jake said in the speech that elicited a standing ovation, wide news media coverage and its own hashtag, #StandWithJake. “Nothing ever changes without people showing that it is O.K. to be different.”Declaring his difference, though, came at a painful cost. He received anonymous and hateful texts. Ugly insults piled up on Instagram and on the high school football field, with opponents shouting slurs during games. And members of the virulently homophobic Westboro Baptist Church traveled to Ladue, Mo., to picket outside his high school.In the end, Indiana State University offered him a full scholarship to play football, and gay rights activists joined friends and strangers at a counterprotest that vastly outnumbered those from the Westboro group. Admiring messages began to pour into his social media accounts, eventually exceeding the taunts. And last spring, he attended his senior prom with his boyfriend, both of them wearing tuxedos with matching pink bow ties.Still, Jake and others like him face formidable headwinds from activists invigorated by the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back transgender and gay rights and a Supreme Court newly dominated by conservatives. Three months ago, the parents of a Division 1 cross-country and track runner on a partial athletic scholarship to Canisius College in Buffalo told her that they would no longer support her after they found photos of her and her girlfriend online. More than 2,400 people donated money to a GoFundMe account, approved by the NCAA, raising nearly $100,000 for Emily Scheck, a sophomore, so that she could stay in school. And earlier this month, the Westboro Baptist Church targeted Jake again, this time on the campus of Western Illinois University as that school’s football team played against Indiana State in their final game of the season. And again, counterprotesters significantly outnumbered them, with more than 100 of Jake’s supporters to the five or so Westboro members.At 19, Jake has already accomplished a lot. In high school, he scored 41 touchdowns, rushed more than 3,400 yards, led his team to a district championship and one state championship, and was named offensive player of the year for the state of Missouri.Jake was born and raised in St. Louis, the son of a white mother and black father. They divorced when he was 2, but football was always part of his family. His grandfather was the head football coach at his high school for more than three decades, and his two older brothers also played the sport there.As he was growing up, America was changing around him. When Michael Sam, an All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri, came out publicly in 2014, Jake’s football coach shared the news as an opportunity to tell his players that he would always have their backs, regardless of their sexuality.“I was really young when I heard that speech, but I thought if I ever come out, he’d be a good person to talk to,” recalled Jake, who is thinking of becoming a clinical psychologist for teenagers and their families.But he continued to struggle with his sexuality for years, telling himself it was just a phase. “Had I not have been an athlete, I think I would have come out a lot sooner,” he said. Instead, he hid behind the persona of a stereotypical jock. He dated girls and began going to therapy and taking antidepressants.“I spent so long acting overly macho, trying to mask who I was, knowing I was living a lie,” he said.In the summer before his junior year, his secret weighing on him, he quietly told a few close friends, then his family, his coach and teammates. Their support gave him the courage to ask out a red-haired, rosy-cheeked varsity swimmer named Hunter Sigmund, who is now a freshman at the University of North Carolina.They are still a couple, despite the nearly 700 miles between them. Their shared struggle of coming-of-age as young gay men has motivated Jake to stand up for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.Across the country, a record seven current college football players are openly gay or bisexual, according to Outsports, a website that showcases L.G.B.T. athletes. Yet Jake almost failed to make that roster, and his experience may help explain why so few college football players are out. When he was a sophomore, Jake was named Class 3 offensive player of the year in Missouri, the same year his high school won the state title. The following season he became the team captain. College coaches had flocked to Ladue to watch him play.“After I came out,” he said, “everything kind of went radio silent.”He said he tried reaching out to the coaches but never heard back, and when his own coach sought to get answers, he was told they had decided to go in a different direction.Indiana State, though, still wanted him to play. During a campus visit in the summer of 2017, he met with the head coach, Curt Mallory, accompanied by his mother and grandparents. “I told him I’m openly gay and that before I committed, I needed to know if that was an issue,” he recalled. Mr. Mallory told him he would do everything in his power to make sure Jake was accepted.“We just treat him like everybody else,” Mr. Mallory said in an interview. “He fit right in. I never thought twice about it.”The traumatic ordeal of publicly coming out made it easier for Jake to be open with his teammates. He sent his future roommate his Instagram profile, which spotlights a mosaic of romantic photos, football game snapshots and gay pride flags. He told the rest of the team over a group chat.“Jake wrote ‘hey guys I’m gay,’” said Chris Childers, 18, a running back from Chicago. “We didn’t believe it at first. It was definitely new for me, but nothing about him being gay will ever affect us being friends or teammates.”A redshirt this year, like most freshman players on his team, Jake appeared in four games, and recently switched from defense to wide receiver. Over the season, which ended after the team’s victory against Western Illinois, he befriended several of his teammates. They bonded during grueling football practices and over nachos at Applebee’s, where Jake didn’t hesitate to share stories about his boyfriend.Still, in some ways his sexuality has made him an outsider in the testosterone-infused world of college football and in the middle of conservative Indiana. He avoided showering with his teammates out of concern for what they might think, and he kept his gay pride tees on a shelf and quit wearing his rainbow-splashed “love is love” hat on campus because, he said, “you get stared at.” He won’t take off two bracelets, though, a rainbow one he got on the day of the first Westboro protest, and geographic coordinates engraved in metal that mark the exact location where he and Hunter officially became a couple. Taking them off, he said, would make him feel like he is hiding a part of himself, and that would be “hypocritical.”For now, Jake said he has found solace in helping the closeted gay teenagers who contact him on Instagram.In April, he received a message from a closeted Irish teenager who described the relentless bullying he experienced at his Catholic all-boys school. “I just admire your bravery and I need someone to guide me on what to do,” the boy wrote.Jake offered some advice and months later, he received a new message: “Jake, one week ago I came out to my family,” wrote the boy, who explained that he had shared Jake’s story with his religious parents, which ultimately helped them accept him for who he is.“Thank you so much,” the boy wrote. “You were the reason I decided to come out.”"
"There may not be any college football players in 2018 who were alive when Arkansas was not in the Southeastern Conference. Most probably do not know there even was such a time.Since joining the SEC in 1991, the Razorbacks have had just one top-10 finish, in 2011, when their two losses came to the two teams that played for the national championship: Alabama and Louisiana State. Those are two extraordinarily formidable programs that, as a member of the SEC West, Arkansas now plays — and often loses to — every year.But before 1991, it was a charter member of the Southwest Conference, and for most of the 20th century the only member of the league from outside Texas. Its biggest rival was the University of Texas, and the Razorbacks had several glorious seasons through the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s under Frank Broyles and Lou Holtz. In 25 years under those coaches, Arkansas had 12 finishes in the Associated Press poll’s top 10 and won the national championship in 1964 with two guys named Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones on the roster.Now Arkansas has a problem that seems all too common among teams that have switched conferences in college football’s modern era, usually with money as a prime motivator: It may just be in the wrong league. Rutgers, Maryland, Boston College — are you listening?“Would it be easier in the Big 12?” said Houston Nutt, the CBS analyst and Little Rock native who played for and later coached the Razorbacks. “Yes. No question. Would it be easier in the Southwest Conference? Yes. No question.“But that wasn’t the way it was,” he added. “So we embraced it.”In college football’s modern era, no fewer than 14 football programs have made lateral moves, from one power conference to another, and several more have been promoted from what were effectively midmajors.The odd configurations created by realignment are familiar to anyone who has heard college football fans’ bellyaches. The Big 12 has 10 teams; the Big Ten, 14. West Virginia and Texas Tech are in the same conference. Michigan now plays Rutgers every year, but Texas and Texas A&M do not meet at all.Arkansas helped set the template: It severed ancient rivalries and forsook geographical proximity to gain stability and the riches of huge television contracts (the SEC added Arkansas and South Carolina partly to stage a lucrative conference championship game).From most perspectives, Arkansas’s conference change has proved prescient. As a member of the world-beating, ultraprominent SEC, Arkansas reaped around $7 million more last year in conference payouts than did members of the Big 12, which does not have its own cable network and which will be the most vulnerable conference should another bout of realignment hit in the middle of the next decade, when conference television contracts are set to expire.As for the Southwest Conference, it disappeared in 1996 after years of scandals, with four of its members joining the former Big Eight in the new Big 12 while others dropped to lower leagues. Arkansas might have still had a good claim to inclusion in a Power 5 league back then, had it not left the Southwest early. Or it might have gone the way of its old league rival Houston, which was left out of the Big 12 initially and then two years ago desperately tried to join it but, despite making a strong case, found itself behind the velvet rope.Teams that changed leagues to stay in a power conference “made a decision to get themselves protected politically, financially and institutionally,” said Mike Tranghese, a former Big East commissioner, who now advises the SEC on men’s basketball.While running the Big East in the 1990s and 2000s, Tranghese added football powers like Miami, West Virginia and Virginia Tech. But the league later imploded as a football conference, with several members leaving for other leagues, mainly the Atlantic Coast Conference.“The schools that left the Big East for the A.C.C. and, in Rutgers’s case, the Big Ten did not go to those leagues thinking they were going to win the national championship,” Tranghese said.In other words: Competition isn’t everything.Or is it?Nutt led the Razorbacks to four divisional titles during his tenure from 1998 to 2007, but they resulted in three conference title-game losses. The Bobby Petrino era, featuring that No. 5 finish in 2011, flamed out in scandal. Bret Bielema’s attempt to install a kind of Big Ten South — stout defense, plodding offense — led to a 29-34 record over the last five seasons, including an 11-29 record in SEC play.This year, the Razorbacks are staring down a particularly bleak stretch. Under a new coach, they are 1-2, with the losses coming to unheralded Colorado State and North Texas. Their next three games are Saturday at No. 9 Auburn; then versus No. 22 Texas A&M in Arlington, Tex.; and then hosting, yes, No. 1 Alabama. A loss in that game would be the 12th in a row to the Crimson Tide.To be sure, there is not yet a grand unifying theory of the competitive effect of realignment. Rutgers had several strong seasons in the Big East roughly a decade ago, and its overall Big Ten record is 7-28. Maryland was not terrible in the A.C.C. but has yet to have a winning season in Big Ten play.But then there is Texas A&M, which won nine more games in its first six seasons in the fearsome SEC West than it did in its last six seasons in the Big 12. Even Nebraska, commonly perceived as a former giant whose power died with the old Big Eight, has fared deceptively well in the Big Ten compared with its final years in the Big 12.Colorado’s move to the Pacific-12 from the Big 12 is difficult to examine dispassionately, given the Buffaloes’ more generally putrid 2000s. They have a division championship in the Pac-12. Could they have done more in the Big 12? Utah’s graduation to the Pac-12 from the Mountain West has hurt the Utes’ win-loss records only slightly, against superior competition.Arkansas, because its switch came so long ago, is an underexamined case study.Nutt, a player and assistant while Arkansas was in the Southwest, looked around the SEC after he took over as coach before the 1998 season. “I could tell it was a very, very difficult league,” he said. “There’s no off Saturdays.”As a smaller state, Arkansas for decades fed off the talent of neighboring Texas, considered the country’s top recruiting state. All of its major rivals were based there, and nearly half of its games were played there — an obvious lift for recruiting.But these days, Arkansas typically plays just one game in the Lone Star State each year, as the annual matchup versus Texas A&M, a former Southwest rival now in the SEC, is staged at AT&T Stadium outside Dallas. The convenience is doubtlessly greased by the Cowboys owner Jones’s love for Arkansas, where he was a captain for the 1964 national champion.Nutt said recruiting for Arkansas was “definitely going to be harder” without playing frequently in Texas. SEC powers like Alabama, L.S.U. and Georgia are flagships of states with larger populations and recruiting bases.“What does that mean?” Nutt said. “You’ve got to be better at recruiting and evaluating.”Nevertheless, Tranghese insisted that how realignment affected competitiveness was nearly beside the point.For many programs, changing leagues “put them in one of the Power 5 conferences, which protected them both politically and institutionally,” Tranghese said. “Anything good that came about regarding competition was a bonus.”He added, “There’s nothing wrong with that.”Fans of Arkansas, Rutgers and a few other programs might beg to differ."
"ATLANTA — The Oklahoma Sooners (12-1) received the final slot in the four-team College Football Playoff on Sunday over primary contenders Ohio State (12-1) and Georgia (11-2), a move that sidestepped the most controversial possible decision in the playoff’s fifth season.The other three teams chosen for the playoff are No. 1 Alabama (13-0), No. 2 Clemson (13-0) and No. 3 Notre Dame (12-0).In the national semifinals, Clemson will play Notre Dame at the Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Tex., on the afternoon of Dec. 29, and Alabama will play Oklahoma at the Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla. in the evening. The winners will play for the national championship on Jan. 7 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.Georgia was ranked fifth in the selection committee’s final rankings, while Ohio State was ranked sixth. Due to a separate contract, the Buckeyes will play the Pacific-12 champion, Washington, in the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day.The Sooners had been ranked fifth before Saturday’s games, just below the Bulldogs at fourth. Ohio State had been sixth. Georgia nearly toppled Alabama in the Southeastern Conference title game here, but the Crimson Tide, behind the starter-turned-backup quarterback Jalen Hurts, came from behind to win, 35-28. Meanwhile, Oklahoma decisively defeated Texas, which in October was the sole team to hand the Sooners a loss this season.In an interview on ESPN shortly after the rankings were released, Rob Mullens, the Oregon athletic director who is the selection committee chairman, said that there was no consensus that any of Oklahoma, Georgia or Ohio State was “unequivocally” better than the other two. At that point, he said, the committee deferred to the protocol it is supposed to use to break ties, which includes conference championships. On Saturday, Oklahoma had won its conference championship, while Georgia had failed to.“No one was unequivocally better than the other,” Mullens said, “so then we leaned on the protocol.”Yet the ranking of Georgia above Ohio State — which, like Oklahoma, won its conference on Saturday — essentially indicated that the room did feel Georgia was unequivocally better than Ohio State, as the tiebreaker would have led Ohio State to be ranked higher.Ohio State fans were able to claim a modicum of redemption, though. If the Buckeyes’ 49-20 loss to Purdue (6-6) in October was one of the two most consequential defeats of the season, the other was Georgia’s 36-16 loss at Louisiana State (9-3) in October. Louisiana State’s quarterback, Joe Burrow, who threw for 200 yards against Georgia, had transferred from Ohio State.Several observers on social media and even on ESPN claimed that Las Vegas point-spreads are proof that Georgia, not Oklahoma, was the best of the three teams.Mullens said there was “strong debate, even division in the room.”Central Florida (12-0), the final undefeated team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, was apparently not considered for the playoff. U.C.F. was No. 8 in the committee’s last rankings and defeated Memphis, 56-41, to win its second straight American Athletic Conference title. The Knights have a 25-game winning streak and last year self-claimed a national title alongside the one Alabama won. But yet again the committee indicated that teams from the so-called Group of Five conferences are unlikely to receive serious playoff consideration.From its official Twitter feed, Central Florida suggested it might be able to find a way to claim a national title again.As the highest-ranked Group of Five champion, Central Florida, which was No. 8 in the final rankings, was guaranteed a spot in a prominent bowl. The Knights will play No. 11 Louisiana State (9-3) in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year’s Day, and Georgia will face Texas in the Sugar Bowl, also on New Year’s Day. No. 7 Michigan (10-2) will play No. 10 Florida (9-3) in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 29.In selecting the Sooners over the Bulldogs, the committee, and the playoff itself, avoided alienating at least one of its patrons. Had it chosen Georgia instead, the committee would have for the first time left three of the five major conferences — the Big 12, the Big Ten and the Pacific-12 — outside the playoff (Notre Dame is independent). And it would have further devalued the importance of conference titles, since it would have had to reject three major-conference champions in favor of the Bulldogs.Alabama, as the top seed, has the right to home-field advantage, and indicated that it did not wish to play Oklahoma at the Dallas Cowboys’ stadium, a few hours down Interstate-35 from its campus in Norman, according to ESPN, the network that broadcasts the playoff.The Crimson Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, a Heisman Trophy hopeful, is expected to be out with an ankle injury for roughly two weeks, Alabama Coach Nick Saban said on ESPN.It is the third year that the Big 12 has been included in the playoff. It has been represented by Oklahoma all three times. And it is the second year in a row that the Big Ten has been excluded despite a strong champion in Ohio State.The Pacific-12, which staged its championship game Friday night between two three-loss teams, was widely understood to have no shot at the playoff. It is the third year in five that the league is not represented.It is Clemson’s fourth straight year in the playoff. And Alabama, the dominant dynasty of its era, has never missed it."
"ATLANTA — After the N.F.L.’s best season in years, Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, got his chance to crow on Wednesday afternoon ahead of its showcase event.“This season has demonstrated that there has never been a better time to be a part of the N.F.L.,” Goodell said. “Our game is getting better and better, and our engagement and popularity is unmatched in today’s media landscape.”Under Goodell, the N.F.L. has tried to be everywhere all the time. The combine, the draft and the minicamps have become manufactured events unto themselves; there are now games on Thursday nights and some, played in London, early on Sunday mornings; and most games have remained on network television even as other sports have largely moved their games to cable and now streaming.A year ago, the strategy was under stress. Then the emergence of a new crop of young stars and a largely controversy-free season combined to drive up television ratings and produce a spectacular weekend of conference championships, capping a winning streak that began with a surprisingly fervent auction for rights to the league’s least popular slate of games.Coming off the 2017 season, after television ratings had dropped 17 percent over the previous two years, the league entered the media market trying to sell the rights to “Thursday Night Football.” CBS and NBC had both said they lost money showing Thursday games, and they weren’t willing to pay much more than the $450 million combined they were paying each year.Then, as in 1993, when an audacious bid for N.F.L. rights ignited a scramble that sent their value soaring, Rupert Murdoch came to the rescue. Fox agreed to pay $660 million annually to show “Thursday Night Football.”Murdoch’s market-resetting bid came shortly after he agreed to sell the vast majority of his empire to Disney, leaving him with a significant need for marquee programming on his network. Also, there was real competition from a tech company.Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s chief media and business officer, said in an interview in September that Fox did not submit the highest bid. A tech company did, he said, though he would not reveal which one.“We turned down higher bids,” he said. “When you put a game exclusively on digital, are you growing the distribution and availability, or are you limiting it, and to the extent how much? And for us, we weren’t sure we wanted to do that yet.”In other words, the N.F.L. stuck to its foundational game plan to be everywhere and accessible. After two seasons of turmoil, the league opted not to break away from its longstanding strategy, but instead doubled down on it.Plenty of dangers still lurk. Football’s concussion crisis threatens the viability of youth football. Colin Kaepernick’s collusion case against the league drags on, suggesting he has a chance to win, and attendance was down to its lowest level in eight seasons. Instead of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady or Rams Coach Sean McVay, the biggest topic ahead of the Super Bowl remains atrocious officiating. The league’s collective bargaining agreement with its players expires in two years, and negotiations will be tough.But Rolapp’s big bet paid off. Every time slot for N.F.L. games, including Thursday night’s, earned higher television ratings this season, a total gain of 5 percent.Incidents of violence against women continued to plague the league. The Kansas City Chiefs cut the Pro Bowl running back Kareem Hunt during the season after video showed him shoving and kicking a woman. The New York Times later reported that the N.F.L. failed to question Hunt about the incident during an interview earlier in the year.The San Francisco 49ers cut Reuben Foster after his second arrest on domestic violence charges in 2018, and three days later he was claimed by Washington, a move that garnered substantial criticism. TMZ also published video of Washington safety Montae Nicholson punching out a man.But Goodell and the N.F.L. limited their unforced errors. There was nothing like the drawn-out legal battle over deflated footballs in 2015 and 2016. And once the N.F.L. realized the opposition it would face if it pushed ahead with a rule mandating players on the field to stand during the national anthem, the league backed off.Young players like Patrick Mahomes, Baker Mayfield, Mitchell Trubisky and Saquon Barkley became stars in 2018, pointing the way to a post-Brady world. High-profile quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck returned to form. High-octane passing offenses took over the league.It all came together in the conference championship games, which featured the four highest seeds and the four highest-scoring teams. Two veteran quarterbacks, Drew Brees and Brady, took on the best young quarterbacks, Jared Goff and Mahomes, in high-scoring shootouts that went to overtime.David Berson, the president of CBS Sports, which will televise the Super Bowl on Sunday, said fewer off-the-field stories were getting attention “because the on-field product is so compelling.” Whether Berson is correct or whether the league simply had a year with fewer controversies ultimately does not matter all that much to the league’s media partners because, as Berson put it, “The focus is on the football, and the football is really exciting.”There were blown calls and rules controversies, of course. The N.F.C. championship game hinged on an egregious no-call, and Brady and the Patriots also benefited from a questionable ruling and a rule that did not allow Mahomes — probably the league’s most valuable player — to get his hands on the football in overtime. But the arguments garnered more attention for the game, which was just what the league wanted.The question now is whether this fundamentally violent sport can be made safer. Before the season, the N.F.L. introduced a rule barring players from using their helmets as weapons when tackling. Six weeks into the season, its enforcement was essentially abandoned, underscoring how difficult it is to legislate between acceptable and unacceptable levels of violence.According to league statistics, concussions were down 29 percent in 2018, to 0.5 per game from 0.7. Jeff Miller, the N.F.L.’s executive vice president for health and safety, cautioned on a recent conference call that “there is no finishing line” when it comes to player safety, but touted the work being done to get players to wear better helmets and to present teams with targeted interventions to prevent concussions.The league’s own concussion data show that the number of concussions each year fluctuates, and that previous reductions were reversed in following seasons. The N.F.L. has also not been able to reduce the instances of A.C.L. and M.C.L. tears, ligament injuries that commonly end players’ seasons.The youth tackle football participation rate has been dropping for a decade, and now the high school tackle football participation rate is declining, too. Just one insurance company is willing to cover professional football leagues for head trauma, according to ESPN, and youth football leagues and school districts are facing insurance premiums that they are struggling to afford.In the off-season, the N.F.L. is likely to receive a ruling in the Kaepernick collusion case. His grievance, which was filed 15 months ago, still hasn’t been heard. It remains difficult for collusion to be proven, but if Kaepernick wins, he could be awarded tens of millions of dollars, and evidence uncovered in discovery and depositions could become public.Attendance in 2018 fell to its lowest level since 2011. This drop will be rectified in part in 2020 when the Los Angeles Chargers move from a 27,000-capacity soccer stadium to a 70,000-capacity football stadium, but Washington, Tampa Bay and Cincinnati all suffered big drops.The N.F.L. operates on two planes: the day-to-day of small crises and opportunities, and the issues that could take a bite out of the $15 billion-a-year league. Most things fall into the first bucket, with no chance of harming a league whose revenue inches upward each season because of television contracts signed earlier in this decade.Over the next decade, the N.F.L.’s ability to handle the changing media and technology environment and the mounting health and safety challenges is likely to determine whether it reaches its goal of $25 billion a year in revenue by 2027 and remains at the pinnacle of American sports.Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons, is confident the league will continue to prosper. He believes the N.F.L. will receive even more money when contracts to telecast Sunday and Monday games expire after the 2021 and 2022 seasons because of “the number of ways the product is distributed these days,” he said.But the root of Blank’s confidence is the league’s longstanding strategy. “The core of it is still going to be over-the-air free television,” he said. “That’s not going to change.”"
"ORLANDO, Fla. — Josh Heupel, the head football coach at the University of Central Florida, was on a recruiting trip several months ago when his wife called and asked when his next flight was.There was no flight. He was simply driving to Jacksonville, a couple of hours from Central Florida’s Orlando campus.“Last year during recruiting, I got on maybe four flights total,” said Heupel, who put in years as a recruiting road warrior when he was an assistant at Oklahoma and Missouri.Florida, after all, has the highest percentage of high school players who are recruited by Division I teams, the most blue-chip recruits of any state, and is by many other metrics the best state in the country in which to set up a college football team. And that makes U.C.F. the current definition of disruption in college football.Still, undefeated U.C.F. is probably the fourth- or fifth-best-known team in the state, a directional university celebrating its 50th anniversary, whose football program has played in college sports’ top tier for barely two decades. Its league, the American Athletic Conference, distributes to its members a small fraction of the windfall from media deals compared with what the biggest conferences deliver to their schools.Three years ago, U.C.F. went 0-12. Yet the No. 10 Knights are, for a second year in a row, the best team in the state and one of the best anywhere else. In the last five years, they have won two New Year’s Day bowl games. They hold the longest active winning streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision, at 19 games.Last year, after the Knights went undefeated, they won the A.A.C. and then beat Auburn in the Peach Bowl. They claimed a national championship, even though they were left out of the four-team College Football Playoff and were ranked sixth in the final Associated Press poll. The N.C.A.A. has formally recognized U.C.F.’s title alongside Alabama’s.This year the offense is ranked third in Division I in yards and seventh in points per game. It is worth noting that a game at North Carolina was called off after Hurricane Florence, and the Knights have trounced mostly weak competition (including one Power 5 team, Pitt) and barely survived Memphis last weekend.“I often say that reputation lags reality,” said Dale Whittaker, the U.C.F. president. He was referring to the university as a whole, but it might apply to the football team especially.Originally Florida Technological University, and founded several miles east of downtown Orlando in connection with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration — Cape Canaveral is less than an hour’s drive to the east — U.C.F. has grown into one of the country’s largest universities, with 68,000 students. Whittaker compares U.C.F. to Ohio State and Arizona State as a giant, urban university well suited to the 21st century’s information economy.As for football, “Our competitive advantages are very real,” said Danny White, the university’s athletic director.“Who doesn’t want to be here?” said Richie Grant, a defensive back from Fort Walton Beach, Fla. “Like, it’s supposed to be fall, winter, something like that? And it’s, what, 90 degrees out here?”Florida being Florida, there will always be a surplus of talent.“They may not be big enough for Florida or Miami to go after them, but they’re still going to be fast or strong,” said Luke Stampini, a recruiting analyst for 247Sports who is based in Delray Beach, Fla.These athletes, then — rawly gifted, but not as purely talented as those who end up at the in-state blue bloods — may need specific schemes built around them, but White conceived the potential for a “moneyball”-esque strategy as he watched Baylor and Texas Christian routinely defeat Texas and Texas A&M during the past decade with innovative game plans.When he arrived in late 2015, White sought a coach who would install a quick tempo to complement the athletes’ physical speed. He got Scott Frost, who had been an assistant at Oregon under Chip Kelly, known for his creativity and fast pace.At Oregon, Frost had tutored Marcus Mariota, who won the Heisman Trophy after his final year with the Ducks and went on to become the Tennessee Titans’ starting quarterback. Mariota is revered in his native state, Hawaii, and so McKenzie Milton, a talented Class of 2016 quarterback from Mililani High School in Hawaii, was receptive to Frost’s entreaties. But Oregon never offered Milton a scholarship.“He’s small,” Stampini said of Milton. “If he was 6-2, the whole Pac-12 would have been after him.”When Frost took the U.C.F. job, Milton flipped his commitment from Hawaii. Last season, he threw for more than 4,000 yards, with 37 touchdowns against nine interceptions, adding 613 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.Frost departed during the past off-season for Nebraska, his alma mater. White turned to Heupel, who ran the Air Raid offense as Oklahoma’s national-title-winning quarterback for Mike Leach, the offensive coordinator at the time.Heupel hired Randy Shannon, a former player and longtime assistant at Miami and then Florida with vital in-state ties, as his defensive coordinator. He got recruits on the phone the night of their first news conference, Heupel said.U.C.F. now has a 45,000-seat stadium and an array of new and planned amenities: a development center, a nutrition center, a scheduled lazy river. The construction is financed through debt, donations and athletics revenue, White said, along with student fees that average out to under $200 per semester, according to Josh Boloña, the student government president.With 68,000 students, the university is set to collect roughly $25 million in fees this year.U.C.F.’s two final games in the regular season are against No. 20 Cincinnati and then down Interstate 4 at South Florida, currently ranked 21st. Win out, and U.C.F. will get a conference championship game against strong competition, but will it be strong enough to impress the playoff committee?Snubbing U.C.F. last year, the playoff committee argued that “they had not been as challenged with their nonconference schedule, and their schedule over all, as teams right above them and right below them,” in the words of Kirby Hocutt, the committee chairman, who is Texas Tech’s athletic director.White felt that was disrespectful not only to U.C.F. but to its league, which counted two other teams in the final A.P. rankings. This past weekend, undefeated Notre Dame moved up a spot in the A.P. poll, to No. 4, after barely beating Pitt — the same squad U.C.F. torched by 31 points a few weeks before. A.A.C. teams, from top to bottom, are 7-8 versus Power 5 teams this year.Two years ago, U.C.F. was one of several finalists for spots in the Big 12 before that conference elected not to expand. The next expansion era most likely will not occur until the middle of the next decade, when several broadcast deals are set to expire. The A.A.C. is preparing to negotiate a new deal now. Its agreement with ESPN expires in 2020.White said the A.A.C. merits inclusion in a “Power 6” setup for the F.B.S. For now, though, the Knights must win all their games and hope a payoff will come.“People are going to look at this conference, look who we played, crossover games, look at scores,” Heupel said, “and I think we’ll be where we want to be.”"
"There have been a host of terrific nicknames in football history, but has there ever been one better than Gronk?Yes, it’s simply the abbreviation of a last name, but in this case it seemed to symbolize the essence of the player: a no-nonsense syllable as forceful as a crunching block to seal the end on a sweep, as dynamic as a leaping touchdown grab over a hapless defender.Gronk even sounds whimsical or playful, which could not be more fitting.The man behind the nickname, New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, announced his retirement on Sunday. At 6-foot-6 and nearly 270 pounds, he always seemed larger than life, but nine years in the N.F.L. will cut anyone down to size. After he had surgeries to his back, arm and knee, even a great nickname couldn’t save Gronk, who gingerly, and wisely, walked away weeks before his 30th birthday.Everyone from his teammates to the Patriots’ hierarchy hurriedly lobbed praise at one of the best tight ends to play the game. And a league lacking in colorful characters suddenly has one fewer.Wide receiver Julian Edelman referred to Gronkowski as, “the other goat” (as in, greatest of all time). Coach Bill Belichick celebrated Gronkowski’s “unmistakably positive energy.” Tom Brady, in an Instagram post directed at Gronkowski, said the Patriots were “almost unbeatable when you were on the field.”Indeed, Gronkowski transformed the position, an achievement that will one day make him a certain Hall of Fame inductee. It wasn’t just Gronkowski’s uncommon mix of size and speed; he played with an inimitable combination of acrobatic athleticism and reckless abandon.With Gronkowski scoring 79 touchdowns in his career, it’s hard to single out one that typified his style of play, but a 19-yard catch-and-run against the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011, Gronkowski’s second season, revealed the kind of mettle he brought to every snap.Lined up in the backfield, Gronkowski grabbed a 1-yard pass from Brady, then stormed up the right sideline, where he evaded three tacklers and vaulted toward the goal line. While in the air, a low hit flipped him upside down, but he still kept his forward momentum, landing precariously in the end zone on the back of his neck. Gronk wobbled to his feet, then performed his signature spiking of the football.The Patriots won 34-3.And then there were the off-the-field antics. He danced on the field and on concert stages, chugged beers thrown to him during victory parades, impishly mugged for cameras behind the back of President Obama when the Patriots were feted at the White House. There were television and movie appearances, major roles in pro wrestling extravaganzas, and party after party where Gronk always seemed to materialize in character as the eternal goofball.Along the way, Gronkowski’s colorful personality brought life to the button-down Patriots and N.F.L.That kind of energy will be hard to replace. With pun intended, today the N.F.L. feels a little deflated.Gronkowski’s retirement may also signal another beginning of the end for the Patriots’ ever-expanding reign. It always seems like folly to forecast the impending demise of the Brady-Belichick Patriots. But Gronkowski was unlike any other tight end, and he leaves a gaping hole for New England.It is true that the Patriots’ offense is notable for how it can morph week to week and season to season. Still, stellar tight end play has been a constant to Belichick’s success, and in Gronkowski, the coach had a weapon who could be a devastating blocker, a third-down possession receiver and a downfield threat mixed into one.Good luck finding another talent like that before Brady’s career concludes.Gronkowski’s unmatched value was on full display in his last football game, the Super Bowl against the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots’ offense was hopelessly out of sync as drive after drive stalled short of scoring. To provide stability, New England turned to its running game, with Gronkowski’s punishing blocks often leading the way.Then, near the midpoint of the fourth quarter, with the game tied, the Patriots ran the same play three times in a row. It was primarily a pass play, but because Gronkowski was one of two tight ends in the huddle before each snap, the Rams had to defend the threat of a rushing attempt by leaving their base defense on the field. That meant one fewer defensive back to cover Gronkowski if he dashed downfield.Which is what happened. On the last of the three plays, Gronkowski shifted into the slot like a wide receiver and the Patriots had the mismatch they sought when Rams linebacker Cory Littleton trotted over — at the last second — to cover Gronkowski.As he had so many times before, Brady lofted a precise pass into a small opening in the defense and Gronkowski dove to make the catch inside the Rams’ 5-yard line.On the next play, Gronkowski sealed the left end with a powerful block on defensive end John Franklin-Myers, and running back Sony Michel dashed just off Gronkowski’s right hip for the go-ahead score in the Patriots’ 13-3 victory.Gronkowski briefly celebrated with teammates in the end zone after the score. Then he slowly, and somewhat laboriously, jogged off the field.About 20 minutes later, the Patriots were draped in confetti at midfield with music blaring along a makeshift stage. Belichick turned at one point and yelled, “Gronk!”Duly summoned, Gronkowski grinned at his coach, who smiled back and said: “You’re a hell of a player.”"
"The College Football Playoff committee has certainly faced tougher tasks than determining which team to slot first in its initial rankings this season.Alabama, the defending national champion and ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press poll, is the only undefeated team left in the Southeastern Conference. This season, its typically stellar defense has been merely excellent, allowing the 16th-fewest yards and 10th-fewest points a game. Its offense, led by the sophomore quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, has been a weekly fireworks show, putting up a nation-leading 54.1 points a game.And so when the selection committee’s rankings were revealed Tuesday night on ESPN, it was — surprise! — the Crimson Tide (8-0) taking the top spot.The rest of the top four — the teams that would, if the season ended today, qualify for the playoff bracket — also largely reflected the A.P. rankings, with No. 2 Clemson (8-0) No. 3 Louisiana State (7-1) and No. 4 Notre Dame (8-0). (A.P. has Notre Dame third and L.S.U. fourth.)The top 10 was rounded out by six teams that are 7-1: No. 5 Michigan, No. 6 Georgia, No. 7 Oklahoma, No. 8 Washington State, No. 9 Kentucky and No. 10 Ohio State.This is the fifth year of the playoff — whose 12-year contract with ESPN runs to $7.3 billion — so fans probably know the drill by now.A refresher: on Dec. 2, the day after the conference championship games are complete, the committee will issue its final rankings and set the bracket.No. 1 will play No. 4 and No. 2 will play No. 3 in the semifinals, which will take place on Dec. 29, at the Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla., and the Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Tex. The national championship game will be Jan. 7 at Levi’s Stadium, the San Francisco 49ers’ home in Santa Clara, Calif.The structure of college football, which has one more so-called power conference than it does playoff spots, guarantees disputation, as at least one power-conference champion will be left out every year. Last year, for the first time, two were left out, as Alabama joined the SEC champion, Georgia, in the playoff instead of the Big Ten champion, Ohio State, which had two losses.If Notre Dame sews up its final four games, there will probably be a similar situation: With wins over Michigan in the season’s first game, and, presumably, No. 19 Syracuse (6-2), which it plays next month, the Fighting Irish, who are independent in football, would probably be shoo-ins.It is also difficult to envision the SEC, with five teams in the top 11, not producing at least one entrant.And with a surprising number of Atlantic Coast Conference teams ranked, Clemson could perhaps afford a loss (perhaps at No. 22 Boston College, or in the conference title game) and still salvage a tournament spot.That could leave as many as three conferences scrapping for as few as one remaining spot.The Pacific-12, which has one team with fewer than two losses (Washington State), will probably be locked out for the third time in five seasons. Oklahoma, which has a loss to No. 17 Texas (6-2), probably needs to run a gantlet including next month at No. 13 West Virginia (7-1) and in the conference title game, probably a rematch versus the Longhorns or the Mountaineers. And in the Big Ten, the title could well come down to the game next month in Columbus featuring the Wolverines — whose loss, at Notre Dame, is more impressive than Ohio State’s, at unranked Purdue.Central Florida, the final undefeated team remaining in the Football Bowl Subdivision, was ranked 12th — exactly as it was at the end of last season, when it was a 12-0 champion of the American Athletic Conference. In the four previous seasons of the playoff, the committee has yet to place a member of a so-called Group of Five league in the top four, including the Knights, who went on to defeat Auburn in the Peach Bowl last season.Many of the most momentous remaining regular-season games will come this weekend. Alabama plays at L.S.U., Georgia goes to Kentucky, West Virginia will be at Texas, and Michigan is being challenged at home by No. 14 Penn State (6-2)."
"The Jets, a football team that has been an N.F.L. punch line for years, asked a comedian to be the master of ceremonies at a loud, flashy event to unveil the team’s new uniforms on Thursday.J.B. Smoove, who has been a suffering Jets fan for decades, stood on the stage at Gotham Hall in Manhattan and urged the star players who were modeling the new threads to wear them proudly and become accustomed to them.“Get comfortable,” Smoove said to quarterback Sam Darnold. “These are your damn pajamas.”When a team finishes last in three consecutive seasons, and has not made the playoffs in eight, sometimes the best approach is to make cosmetic changes and laugh about it. This, after all, is a team that counts “The Butt Fumble” among its most memorable moments of the last several years, so maybe a change was in order.Yet, aside from Smoove, the Jets were very serious — even solemn, at times — about this new endeavor, treating the unveiling of the new uniform at an event space on Broadway much the way a major tech company introduces a fancy new device.There was a D.J., flashing lights, a celebratory video, cheerleaders and, of course, fans chanting J-E-T-S. It was as close as the Jets get to a parade these days.They said that work on the new uniforms began in 2014, which is a long time for anything to do with fashion. Christopher Johnson, the chairman and chief executive, quipped that it took longer to come up with the new duds than it did to build the team’s current stadium in New Jersey.But he noted that it was the perfect moment for a new look. The Jets, who were 4-12 last year, have a new coach, Adam Gase; a talented, second-year quarterback in Darnold; and several other new players, including the star running back Le’Veon Bell. The new uniforms, he said hopefully, signaled a new era for Gang Green.There was also talk of “brand identity” and a “refreshed logo,” the kind of marketing jargon that all teams use when they hope fans will buy items with the new look. (Within minutes of the unveiling, the new uniforms were featured on the home page of the N.F.L.’s website and its shop.) There was even a reference to work on the new design being “an extraordinary process,” as if it included some historic feat of engineering.“You will see the vision behind the process, including the thought, energy and excitement it took to make this change a reality,” Johnson said. “Our fans asked for this change. So did our players. It was time for a new uniform, time for a new look.”That look that fans allegedly asked for consists of a brand-new color (if that is possible) that the Jets call Gotham Green. Besides sounding like a name for a small park in Manhattan, the tint looks like a slight variation of the green it replaced.A more significant change is the new black uniform, with a hue dubbed Stealth Black, that all the players seemed to like a lot.Gone are the trademark vertical stripes on the shoulders. They were swapped out for pointy horizontal stripes that come around the shoulders and aim underneath the neckline, toward the center N.F.L. logo, which sits above the words “New York” in capital letters. It is becoming ever more popular for teams to put their nicknames on jerseys, but the city of origin is not common.The pants, both white (make that Spotlight White) and green, have the same kind of pointy stripes made popular when the Denver Broncos changed their uniform design in 1997. The straight dual stripes that gave the previous Jets uniforms a classic flavor are gone, and with them goes the traditional old logo, too.The Jets traded in the white helmet and the green NY logo that dates back, with slight variations, to the days of Joe Namath and Don Maynard. (Broadway Joe, by the way, was right there on Broadway on Thursday to sanction all the changes.)The new helmet is shiny (Gotham) green with a white logo that has the word “Jets” above a small football, a nod to the football in the old logo. (The Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the only teams with a football in their helmet logos.)When the players, including Jamal Adams, Leonard Williams, Quincy Enunwa and Darnold, were brought on stage to showcase the new look, they danced and posed and later echoed the team line that the new look is bold, innovative and fresh.“I think that a lot of old school people are going to have it grow on them,” Enunwa said and added, “It feels like a new team, in a way.”That is the point. But the Jets are only the most recent N.F.L. team to change uniforms. Some have had more success than others. The Patriots changed their uniforms in 2000, and in their second season in a darker blue color, they won the first of six Super Bowls in them.“I think that’s just a coincidence,” Darnold said. “But no, maybe it’s a telltale sign. If we don’t play well, the uniforms are going to look crummy. If we play well, then they are going to look awesome.”"
"Entering the final weekend of the regular season, with its tantalizing lineup of traditional rivalry games, does it seem as if there is an unusual number of contenders for the four College Football Playoff berths?That’s probably because there are more undefeated or one-loss contenders at this point in the season than there have been in any of the previous four years of the playoff.After Saturday’s games, seven teams from the so-called Power Five conferences, plus Notre Dame, an independent whose schedule matches it with power-conference teams, had no losses or just one. (From the second-tier conferences, known as the Group of Five, Central Florida remains undefeated, with 23 straight wins, and Utah State is 10-1, but the selection committee has ignored such teams in the past.) There were seven in 2014 and 2015 — when North Carolina, at 10-1, was not considered a serious contender. There were six last year, and just four in 2016. The selection committee had it easy!It easily could have been nine such teams, but West Virginia lost unexpectedly at Oklahoma State (6-5) on Saturday, dropping to 9-2 and No. 12 in the Associated Press poll.Here are those final eight: No. 1 Alabama (11-0), No. 2 Clemson (11-0), No. 3 Notre Dame (11-0), No. 4 Michigan (10-1), No. 5 Georgia (10-1), No. 6 Oklahoma (10-1), No. 7 Washington State (10-1) and No. 10 Ohio State (10-1).So the final week of the 2018 season is shaping up to be the most consequential in years — and the decisions regarding those four spots in the bracket could be the most hotly debated yet.Of those eight contenders, four are playing traditional rivals in relatively easy games; two are playing against stout, highly ranked competition; and the final two are playing each other in perhaps the biggest rivalry game of them all: Michigan-Ohio State, on the last Saturday of the regular season, at noon (as always).The Buckeyes helped neither themselves nor the Wolverines by needing overtime on Saturday to defeat Maryland (5-6). Last week, the selection committee and the A.P. voters ranked two-loss Louisiana State above Ohio State, and it seems likely that this week, the committee will join the A.P. in slotting Central Florida above them.And yet, salvation may await. If Ohio State wins on Saturday against Michigan and its top-ranked defense, that will immediately become the most impressive victory on the Buckeyes’ résumé.The winner of Ohio State-Michigan will play No. 20 Northwestern (7-4) the next weekend in Indianapolis in the Big Ten championship game. If the Wolverines beat the Buckeyes and finish with just one loss — at Notre Dame back in September — could the committee leave them out of the playoff?It would be unlikely in a normal year, but this is not a normal year.Alabama will try to avenge its Iron Bowl loss last year against Auburn (7-4) in Tuscaloosa on Saturday. Much was made of the 10-10 halftime score this weekend when Alabama hosted the Citadel of the lower-tier Football Championship Subdivision, but let the record show that the final score was 50-17.Clemson welcomes South Carolina (6-4) to the Upstate a week after demolishing Duke, 35-6.Notre Dame, fresh off its big win over Syracuse, heads to Los Angeles to face Southern California (5-6), which on Saturday handed U.C.L.A. and Chip Kelly their third win of the year.And Georgia will host Georgia Tech (7-4).Pause here for a moment. Those four teams — all heavily favored to win — will be extremely well-positioned for the playoff if they do win. As some are already noticing, those teams’ inclusion in the playoff would lock out three Power Five conferences — which could be a problem for the four-team playoff just five years into its 12-year contract.After Saturday, Notre Dame has no more scheduled games. Clemson faces No. 24 Pittsburgh (7-4) for the Atlantic Coast Conference championship up the road in Charlotte, N.C. And Alabama and Georgia will contest the Southeastern Conference title in Atlanta. Would the committee hold a loss against either team, particularly with Georgia’s sole defeat to this point having come on the road at No. 7 L.S.U. (9-2)?Now consider the other four contenders, who face far tougher tests.It starts Friday night as Oklahoma faces still-formidable West Virginia on the road.Also that night, Washington State hosts No. 16 Washington (8-3) in the 112th Apple Cup. The winner will play No. 18 Utah (8-3) in the Pacific-12 title game a week later.And then Saturday brings Michigan-Ohio State.So whom does the committee leave out? A one-loss Alabama team that fails to win its conference? Or Oklahoma, 12-1 with a Big 12 championship? Or a 12-1 Washington State team with a Pac-12 title?There are no good solutions, and the most likely outcome is a bad one for someone.One of the great things about rivalry weekend is that the passion the games generate invariably leads to a few upsets. Advice to the committee: Root for plenty of those."
"A simple rule change in Ivy League football games has led to a significant drop in concussions, a study released this week found.After the Ivy League changed its kickoff rules in 2016, adjusting the kickoff and touchback lines by just five yards, the rate of concussions per 1,000 kickoff plays fell to two from 11, according to the study, which was published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Kickoffs, during which players sprint down the field and can knock into each other at full speed, had previously represented an outsize number of concussions.The study comes amid a broader push to adjust kickoff rules at all levels of football and offers a strong indication that touchbacks can help reduce the risk of head injury in a sport grappling with the competing priorities of entertaining its audience and keeping its players safe.“We see really compelling evidence that, indeed, introducing the experimental kickoff rule seems to be associated with a large reduction in concussions,” said Douglas Wiebe, the lead author of the study and the director of the Penn Injury Science Center at the University of Pennsylvania.In 2015, kickoffs during Ivy League games accounted for 6 percent of all plays, but 21 percent of concussions, the study said. So Ivy League football coaches decided to change the rules to encourage kicks into the end zone.Under the new system, teams kicked off from the 40-yard line, instead of the 35, and touchbacks started from the 20-yard line, rather than the 25.The result? A spike in the number of touchbacks — and “a dramatic reduction in the rate of concussions,” Dr. Wiebe said.The study looked at the rate of concussions over three seasons before the rule change (2013 to 2015) and two seasons after it (2016 to 2017). Researchers saw a larger reduction in concussions during kickoffs after the rule change than they did with other types of plays, like scrimmages and punts, which saw only a slight decline.The Ivy League — an N.C.A.A. conference that includes Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Princeton and Yale — has been among the most aggressive college conferences in addressing the risks associated with the collisions that are endemic to the game. In 2016, Ivy League football coaches took the extraordinary step of eliminating all full-contact hits from practices during the regular season.But the N.C.A.A. as a whole has also taken action to target kickoffs. For example, a new rule this season allows receiving teams to wave for a fair catch anywhere inside the 25-yard line and have it result in a touchback.In a statement on Monday, the N.C.A.A. said that it had an early look at Ivy League concussion data before approving its new rule.“Ivy League concussion data were initially presented to the N.C.A.A. and numerous other relevant stakeholders in early 2018,” the statement said. That data was among the information, it said, that “contributed significantly to the discussions and analysis that resulted in new football kickoff rules for the 2018 season.”The N.F.L. has also made changes to kickoff rules and saw a reduction in concussions after it moved its kickoff line from the 30-yard line to the 35 before the 2011 season, according to the league’s own figures.It also implemented a new rule this year that requires players to line up near the kickoff line, rather than allow them to make a running start.Dr. Wiebe, the lead author on the Ivy League study, said, “It’s great to see a success story here.” But he noted that plays other than kickoffs also result in concussions.“We do need to step back and think about the rest of the game,” he said."
"[College Football Playoff: Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Oklahoma are in.]Kyler Murray threw for 379 yards and three touchdowns as No. 5 Oklahoma beat No. 9 Texas in the Big 12 championship game on Saturday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., the Sooners avenging their only loss and making their case for a return to the College Football Playoff.Murray, the Heisman Trophy-contending dual-threat quarterback, completed 25 of 34 passes and threw two of his touchdowns to Grant Calcaterra. One of those was an impressive one-handed grab for an 18-yard score on third-and-10 with two minutes left as the Sooners (12-1), No. 5 in the playoff rankings, won their seventh consecutive game.“That catch will live on in Oklahoma history forever,” Coach Lincoln Riley said. “What a play.”Oklahoma is the first team from a Power Five conference to win four consecutive outright conference titles since Florida did so in the SEC in the mid-1990s.“We’re thrilled by the victory,” Riley said. “It’s been a challenging year, which they all are. But to sit here now as four-time defending Big 12 champion, man, that sounds good.”Sam Ehlinger was 23 of 36 passing for 349 yards with two touchdowns for Texas (9-4), and he also ran for two scores. But his final pass was picked off by Tre Norwood at the 1 in the final minute.The Sooners went ahead to stay, at 30-27, on Austin Seibert’s third field goal, a 31-yarder with 12:37 left that was good after ricocheting off the top of the left upright.Two plays after Oklahoma’s only turnover — receiver CeeDee Lamb fumbled inside the 10 after a 54-yard catch-and-run with nine minutes left — the Sooners got points anyway. On a blitz, cornerback Tre Brown sacked Ehlinger in the end zone for a safety.“Our defense did a great job getting the ball back to us; offensively, we didn’t take care of our part of the bargain,” Ehlinger said. “That’s on us. That’s on me. I will make it my mission to never let this team or this school feel this disappointment again.”It was a huge play for a much-maligned Sooners defense that had allowed at least 40 points in each of the previous four games. Oklahoma won three of those by a combined 9 points.Lamb finished with six catches for 167 yards, including a 28-yard touchdown in the first half.Dwayne Haskins added five more touchdown passes to his single-season record, and No. 6 Ohio State relied on its staunch defense to hold off a second-half charge from No. 21 Northwestern in Indianapolis and claim its second straight Big Ten championship.The Buckeyes (12-1) won their third title in five years and their fifth consecutive game, but it is unlikely to get the Buckeyes into the four-team playoff, for which they are ranked No. 6.Haskins completed 34 of 41 passes with 499 yards and an interception, the fifth time he topped 400 yards this season.Clayton Thorson went 27 of 44 with 267 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions as he helped Northwestern trim a 24-7 halftime deficit to 24-21 midway through the third quarter. The Wildcats (8-5) could not get any closer, though, as they lost only their second league game in their last 17.Haskins eluded a couple of defenders on third-and-11 on the game’s opening possession, buying just enough time to find Terry McLaurin for a 16-yard touchdown pass.Northwestern tied the score when the little-used running back John Moten IV outran Ohio State’s defense for a 77-yard scoring run. It matched Ohio State’s a run by J. K. Dobbins in last year’s title game for the second longest in title game history.The Buckeyes answered with what appeared to be a knockout flurry. Dobbins scored on a 2-yard run, Blake Haubeil made a 42-yard field goal, and McLaurin caught a 42-yard touchdown pass from Haskins that made it 24-7 at the half.Travis Etienne ran for 156 yards and two touchdowns, Trevor Lawrence threw two short scoring passes to Tee Higgins, and No. 2 Clemson beat Pittsburgh (7-6) in Charlotte, N.C., becoming the first team to win four straight Atlantic Coast Conference championships.Clemson (13-0), also No. 2 in the playoff rankings, is expected to face third-ranked Notre Dame, which was idle Saturday, in the playoff on Dec. 29.The Tigers ran for 301 yards and four touchdowns and averaged 9 yards per carry on a dreary, rain-soaked night in which Lawrence was limited to 118 yards passing.Clemson forced three turnovers, including two in the first half that gave the offense the ball inside Pitt’s 10-yard line and led to 14 points. The Tigers limited Panthers quarterback Kenny Pickett to 8 yards passing and had nine tackles for a loss.The Tigers joined Steve Spurrier’s Florida Gators (1993-96) as the only Power Five teams to win four straight conference titles. The historic win came exactly 10 years after Dabo Swinney was hired as Clemson’s coach.Unbeaten Central Florida updated its sparkling résumé with an impressive come-from-behind victory over visiting Memphis (8-5) in the American Athletic Conference title game.Now the seventh-ranked Knights (11-0), who proclaimed themselves national champions last January after finishing as the only undefeated team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, will see if repeating as A.A.C. champs and having a 25-game winning streak, the longest in the F.B.S., are good enough to get them into the playoff. They are No. 8 in the playoff rankings.“There’s been a national conversation for 11 months since U.C.F. won the Peach Bowl and claimed a championship,” Danny White, the university’s athletic director, said after Saturday’s game.White said he hopes the team is included when the playoff lineup is announced on Sunday, adding, “If that does not occur, I think that’s another pretty glaring example a four-team playoff is not adequate for the postseason.”Darriel Mack Jr. shrugged off two early turnovers and rushed for four second-half touchdowns, rallying the Knights past the Tigers (8-5) for the fourth time in two seasons.With Mack, a red-shirt freshman, filling in for the injured quarterback McKenzie Milton, U.C.F. amassed 698 yards of total offense and tightened defensively after a shaky start, limiting Memphis to 3 points after halftime.Mack completed 19 of 27 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns without an interception. Greg McCrae rushed for 206 yards and a touchdown for the Knights, who beat the Tigers, 62-55, in the 2017 A.A.C. title game and rallied from a 16-point second-half deficit to win, 31-30, at Memphis during the regular season.? Ronnie Rivers scored on a 1-yard run in overtime, giving No. 24 Fresno State a 19-16 victory at No. 19 Boise State in the snowy Mountain West championship game. Fresno State (11-2) won its first conference title since 2013, beating the Broncos (10-3) on their blue turf for the first time in 10 tries. Boise State’s seven-game winning streak ended, and both teams’ dreams of crashing the New Year’s Six bowl games died when U.C.F. beat Memphis.? David Montgomery ran for 145 yards and two touchdowns, and No. 24 Iowa State (8-4) barely survived a near-upset by visiting Drake (7-4), a nonscholarship Football Championship Subdivision program, with a 27-24 victory. Brock Purdy had 153 yards passing and a touchdown for the Cyclones, who fought through persistent rain and won their sixth straight home game, tying a program record.? Spencer Brown ran for 156 yards and a touchdown, Nick Vogel put Alabama-Birmingham (10-3) ahead with a field goal with 3:23 remaining, and the Blazers, whose program was reinstated last season after a two-year hiatus, beat host Middle Tennessee (9-4), 27-25, in the Conference USA championship game.? Chris Puzzi kicked a 38-yard field goal as time ran out, giving Colgate (10-1) a 23-20 victory at home over James Madison (9-4) and sending the Raiders to the F.C.S. playoff quarterfinals. Puzzi’s winning kick, his third field goal of the game, came after James Madison fell short on a fake punt on fourth and 5, giving the Raiders the ball at their 39-yard line with 2:46 left.? In other F.C.S. playoff games, seventh-seeded Maine (9-3) used a big first half to defeat visiting Jacksonville State (9-4), 55-27. Kennesaw State (11-1) kicked a field goal with less than two minutes left for a 13-10 victory at home over Wofford (9-4). South Dakota State (9-2) routed visiting Duquesne, 51-6, and host North Dakota State romped over Montana State, 52-10. Weber State (10-2) defeated visiting Southeast Missouri State (9-4), 48-23, and host Eastern Washington (10-2) topped Nicholls State (9-4), 42-21. U.C. Davis (9-2), playing at home, beat Northern Iowa (7-5), 23-16.? Zac Thomas had two long touchdown runs, Darrynton Evans set up a score with a 97-yard kickoff return, and host Appalachian State (10-2) defeated Louisiana-Lafayette (7-6), 30-19, in the Sun Belt Conference championship game. The victory earned the Mountaineers the conference’s automatic berth in the New Orleans bowl Dec. 15 against a Conference USA team.? De’Shawn Waller ran 16 times for 177 yards and three touchdowns, and Alcorn State (9-3) beat visiting Southern (7-4), 37-28, for the Southwestern Athletic Conference title. The Braves won their third SWAC title in five years and advanced to the Celebration Bowl in Atlanta, where they will face North Carolina A&T, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference champion, on Dec. 15."
"ST-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — What better outfit to wear to the first Ryder Cup in France than a bicorn hat, an officer’s waistcoat and gold epaulets?“We did our research, and we found that Napoleon played in the first Ryder Cup in 1815,” deadpanned Andy Pick, an Englishman who had crossed the Channel with a similarly dressed friend, Jonathan Brown from Bath.“Napoleon left his putt short to lose it on the last,” Brown said. “He was missing one revolution.”Brown and Pick, suspect historians but serious golf fans, were part of the biggest crowd at the first tee of a Ryder Cup in Europe since the inaugural event in 1927.The crowd assembled before dawn on Friday morning to await the opening four-ball matches in a 6,900-seat temporary grandstand — a fine spot to watch the sunrise as well as some golf. There were thousands of other fans crowded onto nearby knolls and ridges by the time Justin Rose and Jon Rahm of Europe teed off against Brooks Koepka and Tony Finau of the United States shortly after 8 a.m.“It was a hideous 4 a.m. wake-up,” said Scott Tucker, a Londoner who traveled with his brother Ollie to Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs. They came to support the side that has won six of the last eight Ryder Cups but lost the last one, two years ago in the United States.Both were wearing custom-ordered caps that said, “Make Europe Great Again.”Europe’s golfers did not initially cooperate, losing the morning session by 3-1. But like the wind, they picked up in the afternoon, sweeping the four alternate shot, or foursomes, matches to take a 5-3 lead and the momentum into Saturday.“It was a bit of a roller-coaster ride, to be honest,” said Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, who has ridden a few in his years as a Ryder Cup player and leader.One of the players who made it fun for Bjorn on Friday afternoon was Ian Poulter, the prickly English competitor who has routinely risen to the occasion at the Ryder Cup, eyes bulging and fists clenching as he embraced the pressure.He did not make the team in 2016, largely because of an arthritic foot that made it difficult for him to walk, much less beat Americans at golf. He served instead in the shadows as a vice captain, but he was back in the sunshine and in a leading role.He helped lift Rory McIlroy out of a morning funk as they rallied to defeat Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, 4 and 2, in the foursomes. As the match turned into a mismatch, Poulter and McIlroy were practically walking in step between shots.“Four years is a long wait, but the second I got going this morning, I felt good,” Poulter said. “It’s great to play with Rory. The buzz around the golf course is just incredible.”Poulter, 42, is 12-5-2 over all in Ryder Cup play and 5-1 in foursomes. He did not play in the Friday morning session, but he was hardly sitting in the European team room with his eyes on the big screen. He was out on the first tee early, helping lead the European fans in an Icelandic thunderclap. He later climbed the steps and mingled with the throngs in the first-tee grandstand, distributing European team trinkets.“I shared a car home with Thomas last night,” he said, referring to Bjorn. “And I just said to Thomas I would be up there early and I’m going in that grandstand.’ He didn’t say, ‘No, don’t do it.’ So I went up there to enjoy it.”The first tee is Off Broadway at most stroke-play events, where the closing holes are the magnets. But in match play like the Ryder Cup, there is no guarantee the closing holes will be necessary: None of the foursome matches on Friday afternoon extended beyond the 16th hole.The first tee is a sure thing, however, and it has grown into a genuine happening since the distant, quieter days of, say, 1977, when it was tucked behind the pro shop at Royal Lytham & St. Annes and the only people gathered around at the start were players, caddies and officials.“There was nothing to it at all,” said George O’Grady, a former chief executive of the European Tour, who played a role in the change.The first-tee infrastructure keeps growing. There were a little less than 1,900 seats in the grandstand the last time Europe hosted the Ryder Cup, in 2014 at Gleneagles in Scotland. There was even a narrow tunnel leading from the practice ground to the tee that was lined with photographs of Ryder Cup luminaries from the past, including Jack Nicklaus and Seve Ballesteros.There is no tunnel this time, just an elevated walkway and staircase that the players and their growing Ryder Cup entourages can navigate amid the roars and the thunderclaps (or in the case of the Americans on Friday, a few whistles).“Nothing like I’ve been a part of in my life,” said Finau, a Ryder Cup rookie who struck the first tee shot of the competition, at Koepka’s request.“It was like a feeling of a football game back in the States, an N.F.L. football game, and I’m in the middle of the field and I have to hit a tee shot,” Finau said. “I have to make a golf swing with all that type of adrenaline.”So much adrenaline that, despite intending to play it safe, he nearly hit his 3-iron into the water.“The ball just kept rolling,” Finau said.After all the morning tee shots were hit, just before 9 a.m., the first-tee grandstand all but emptied except for a few stragglers — and some American and European Union flags still dangling from the railings.Pick and Brown were trudging off with the masses toward other greens and grandstands, their bicorn hats and epaulets firmly in place.“We wore berets yesterday,” Brown said."
"Oklahoma State quarterback Taylor Cornelius was nearly flawless against Oklahoma last week, only to misfire on a 2-point conversion pass to Tylan Wallace in a 1-point loss.But on Saturday, the connection worked: Cornelius threw a touchdown pass to Wallace with 42 seconds remaining, and host Oklahoma State beat No. 7 West Virginia (8-2, 6-2 Big 12), 45-41.In his final home game, Cornelius passed for 338 yards and five touchdowns and ran for 106 yards and a score, helping Oklahoma State (6-5, 3-5) become bowl eligible.West Virginia’s Will Grier passed for 364 yards and two touchdowns, but his Heisman campaign took a hit with the loss. West Virginia, which is No. 9 in the College Football Playoff rankings, still has a shot at reaching the Big 12 title game.West Virginia Coach Dana Holgorsen said his team should have been in a better position late.“I think we left probably 14 points out there,” he said. “When you are in the red zone and can’t punch it in — if you are a great offense, you do that.”Ninth-ranked Ohio State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten) went to overtime to avoid one of the most stunning upsets in this season, defeating host Maryland (5-6, 3-5) when the Terrapins failed to convert a 2-point conversion after the potentially game-tying touchdown.Favored by 14 ½ points, Ohio State, No. 10 in the playoff rankings, trailed by two touchdowns in the third quarter and by 45-38 with less than two minutes left before rallying to a pivotal victory.After a 5-yard touchdown run by Dwayne Haskins gave the Buckeyes the lead to start overtime, Tayon Fleet-Davis scored, narrowing the Terrapins’ deficit to a point. Maryland’s interim coach, Matt Canada, decided to try to end it right there, going for 2, but Tyrrell Pigrome’s pass to Jeshaun Jones was off target.Tua Tagovailoa passed for 340 yards and three touchdowns, but No. 1 Alabama struggled for 30-plus minutes at home before putting away the Citadel.The Crimson Tide (11-0), which had coasted against Southeastern Conference opponents, went into halftime tied 10-10 with the Bulldogs (4-6) of the Football Championship Subdivision. Alabama was unable to rest easy until it had scored two touchdowns in a 12-second span on its way to a 27-point third quarter.Tagovailoa completed 18 of 22 passes in three quarters, including touchdowns of 21 and 5 yards to Jaylen Waddle and a 68-yarder to tight end Irv Smith Jr. He broke A J McCarron’s single-season program record of 30 touchdown passes, reaching 31.Trevor Lawrence completed 21 of 38 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns, and No. 2 Clemson overcame a slow start, beating visiting Duke (7-4, 3-4) and finishing a perfect Atlantic Coast Conference season.Clemson (11-0, 8-0) fell behind by 6-0 early. But Etienne ran for 77 yards on four carries in the second half, with touchdowns runs of 27 and 29 yards, and Lawrence broke it open with a 10-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Chase in the fourth quarter.The Clemson senior Hunter Renfrow left the game in the first quarter after setting a team record by catching a pass in his 39th straight game. There was no immediate update on his injury.Karan Higdon ran for a go-ahead touchdown early in the third quarter, and Jake Moody set a program record with six field goals, helping No. 4 Michigan (10-1, 8-0 Big Ten) beat visiting Indiana (5-6, 2-6).The Wolverines, No. 4 in the playoff rankings, looked sluggish, and it might have had something to do with their looking ahead to next week’s game at No. 9 Ohio State, where they need a victory to reach the Big Ten championship game for the first time.Indiana led by 17-15 at halftime and finished with more yards, 385, than any team has had against Michigan’s top-ranked defense this season.The freshman Justin Fields threw two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, Tyler Simmons had rushing and receiving scores, and No. 5 Georgia (10-1) protected its playoff hopes, overwhelming visiting Massachusetts (4-8).Another freshman, James Cook, ran for 76 yards on three carries, including his first two career scoring runs, from 26 and 27 yards. Georgia gained 701 yards, including 426 on the ground, and never punted. Fields led the Bulldogs with 100 yards rushing, including a career-long run of 47 yards and a 3-yard scoring run. He completed 5 of 8 passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns.Kyler Murray accounted for two of his five touchdowns in the fourth quarter to help No. 6 Oklahoma (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) survive a big game by the Kansas freshman running back Pooka Williams Jr.Oklahoma, No. 6 in the playoff rankings, moved closer to a spot in the conference championship game, and Murray bolstered his Heisman Trophy campaign in what was most likely his final home game. Williams rushed for a career-high 252 yards and two touchdowns and threw for a score for visiting Kansas (3-8, 1-7).Joe Burrow passed for a career-high 307 yards and two touchdowns in less than three quarters, and No. 10 Louisiana State (9-2) rolled to a victory at home over struggling Rice (1-11). Nick Brossette rushed for two touchdowns for L.S.U., which is No. 7 in the playoff rankings.McKenzie Milton threw for 268 yards and accounted for four touchdowns, helping No. 11 Central Florida (10-0, 7-0 American Athletic Conference) remain unbeaten and extend the longest winning streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision to 23 games with a rout at home of No. 19 Cincinnati (9-2, 5-2). The Knights clinched the A.A.C. East Division title and a spot in the league’s championship game.Sam Ehlinger ran for a touchdown and passed for another before leaving with a shoulder injury, and No. 13 Texas (8-3, 6-2) smothered the freshman quarterback Brock Purdy in a victory at home over No. 18 Iowa State (6-4, 5-3) that pushed the Longhorns, No. 15 in the playoff rankings, closer to a berth in the Big 12 championship game.What appeared to be a 34-yard touchdown pass by Colorado State’s Collin Hill to Preston Williams with no time left was negated by a penalty, giving No. 14 Utah State (10-1, 7-0 Mountain West) a victory over the host Rams (3-8, 2-5) in a wild and stunning finish to a game played in snow and freezing rain.Feleipe Franks passed for 274 yards and three touchdowns, all in the first half, and No. 15 Florida (8-3) ran up 600 total yards at home as it routed overmatched Idaho (4-7). Florida, No. 13 in the playoff rankings, rolled to a 49-0 lead at halftime.Trace McSorley threw two touchdown passes to tight end Pat Freiermuth, and No. 16 Penn State’s defense set up two touchdowns with turnovers in a victory at Rutgers, sending the Scarlet Knights (1-10, 0-7 Big Ten) to their 10th straight loss. The victory was No. 30 for McSorley as a starter, making him the winningest quarterback in program history at Penn State (8-3, 5-3).Jake Browning threw three touchdown passes, and Myles Gaskin rushed for 135 yards in the final home game of their careers, and No. 17 Washington (8-3, 6-2 Pacific-12) scored 28 first-quarter points on its way to a victory over visiting Oregon State (2-9, 1-7).Mike Edwards had two takeaways that led to Kentucky’s first two touchdowns, and the No. 20 Wildcats (8-3) made several fourth-quarter defensive stops as they escaped visiting Middle Tennessee State (7-4).Jason Shelley threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns in the snow, leading No. 21 Utah to a victory at Colorado (5-6, 2-6) and bringing the Utes (8-3, 6-3) closer to their first Pac-12 title game appearance.Deondre Francois threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to Tamorrion Terry with less than two minutes left, and host Florida State (5-6, 3-5 A.C.C.) beat No. 22 Boston College (7-4, 4-3), keeping its bowl hopes alive.Isaiah Bowser rushed for 85 yards and two touchdowns, and No. 24 Northwestern (7-4, 7-1) turned three turnovers by Minnesota quarterback Tanner Morgan into 10 points on the way to a victory over the Gophers (5-6, 2-6) that stretched its program-record road winning streak to eight games. Northwestern is No. 22 in the playoff rankings.Nick Fitzgerald threw for four touchdowns and ran for one more score, leading No. 25 Mississippi State (7-4, 3-4 SEC) over visiting Arkansas (2-9, 0-7). In his final home game for Mississippi State, which is No. 21 in the playoff rankings, Fitzgerald completed 9 of 14 passes for 127 yards and ran for 85 yards, including a 2-yard touchdown.? Tom Stewart threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns before being taken off the field on a stretcher, and Harvard (6-4, 4-3 Ivy League) beat Yale (5-5, 3-4), 45-27, at Fenway Park in Boston in the teams’ 135th meeting.? Fullback Darnell Woolfolk rushed for three touchdowns, the 10th multiple-score game in his career, and Kelvin Hopkins Jr. ran for an additional score as Army (9-2) held off visiting Colgate (9-1), 28-14, ending a 14-game winning streak for the Raiders of the F.C.S.? The freshman wide receiver Mike Roussos returned a punt 91 yards for a score in the first quarter and then scored on an 87-yard kickoff return with 45 seconds left in the game, and Columbia (6-4, 3-4 Ivy) rallied for a 24-21 victory at home over Cornell (3-7, 2-5) and consecutive winning seasons for the first time in 56 years.? Antonio Jackson returned an interception 70 yards for the go-ahead touchdown, and visiting Fordham (2-9, 2-4 Patriot League) turned back Bucknell (1-10, 1-5), 17-14.? John Lovett passed for 255 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for 123 yards and one more score, and Princeton (10-0, 7-0) beat visiting Penn (6-4, 3-4), 42-14, for its first perfect season since 1964. It is Princeton’s fourth outright Ivy League title, but its first since 1995."
"“Art gave me something to segue into,” said Keith Rivers, a former N.F.L. linebacker, at his art-filled house in Beverly Hills. “I’ve really gotten serious as far as studying, going to shows, going to all the museums I can.”Mr. Rivers, who is 32, is throwing himself into art and culture in a way few people can. He plans to move to Paris this summer and use it as a base of operations for an immersive year of learning that will include studying French and trying to visit every art museum in Europe. “That will be my art history,” he said.In the meantime, for research, he has a tall stack of old art magazines and catalogs flagged with Post-its that he referred to frequently during a recent conversation about his collection.During his rookie season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2009, Mr. Rivers bought his first piece — an Andy Warhol Electric Chair print — after a trip to the Museum of Modern Art with a woman he had been interested in when he was studying at the University of Southern California. “She was an art history major and explained Oldenburg to me,” he said. “I got curious.” She married someone else, but the curiosity remained.Since he retired from football in 2015, after also having played for the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills, Mr. Rivers has deepened his pursuit of contemporary art and owns work by Rashid Johnson, Kerry James Marshall, Kara Walker, Tony Lewis, Sonia Gomes and Arjan Martins, among others.Works with strong graphic punch dominate his walls. Raised eyebrows and furrowed foreheads peer from a large piece by John Baldessari. A text-based canvas by Barbara Kruger proclaims, “You drive a hard bargain.” Glenn Ligon’s hot pink and yellow lettering on a red canvas spells out a Richard Pryor joke. In a Cyprien Gaillard piece, the cartoon face of Chief Wahoo — the logo of the Cleveland Indians — is superimposed on a pristine American landscape.“It calls out the paradox of rooting for this mascot, a caricature of a Native American, and how outdated caricatures live on through marketing,” Mr. Rivers said.“So many guys get done with football, and they have nothing; that became their sole identity,” he said. Art has “given me a whole new structure.”These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why did you give up football?I’d been injured a lot. My interest was shifting toward things like art. If you’re not fully into football, it’s not the sport to play because you can really get hurt.How did you initially get interested in art?In high school, a girlfriend of mine was in a photography class. She’d pull me out of class sometimes to go take photos. In 2017, I was walking in Amsterdam with that same friend, who lives there, and she reminded me of that fact. I almost cried. I said, “Oh my God, you planted a seed for this passion.”How would you define the focus of your collection?At the moment I’m drawn toward art that has political meaning because of the times that we’re in. Issues of identity and language are highly important to me. There’s an element of race in the collection.That [canvas spelling out the date “Mar.3.1991”] is by Juan Capistrán, who was raised in South-Central. It is done in pig’s blood and is Rodney King day.John Edmonds does this “Hoods” series, which I just had to have. I grew up about 5 to 10 minutes away from Trayvon Martin’s murder. You can’t see anybody’s face in these photographs. With a hood, you don’t know who anyone could be from the back.Do you do a lot of research before you buy, or do you go with your gut?A little bit of both, depending on the price. Like the Glenn Ligon, I did extensive research for the best work that I could obtain. This is Lubaina Himid, the first black woman and the oldest person to win the Turner Prize. I had read about her in The New York Times, and then when I was at Basel [the art fair] this year, a friend came up and said, “You’ve got to come see this artist.” I was able to buy it quickly because something clicked.Are you involved with museums in any formal role?I’m on the executive committee for the Young Patrons Group at the Hammer Museum. It’s an opportunity to get people who are interested in art but may be intimidated. This is a great group to tear down some of those walls."
"Is there something intrinsic to each league that makes it more or less likely to send a member to the four-team College Football Playoff?Only two have sent at least one representative every year: the Atlantic Coast and Southeastern conferences. They look likely to do so again. No. 2 Clemson (7-0) handled the A.C.C.’s other unbeaten team, North Carolina State, 41-7, on Saturday. In the SEC, there is the round robin of No. 1 Alabama (8-0), No. 4 Louisiana State (7-1) and No. 7 Georgia (6-1). L.S.U. has beaten Georgia and will host the Crimson Tide on Nov. 3, after each team’s bye week. The Bulldogs will meet No. 9 Florida (6-1) in Jacksonville this Saturday.It is possible that the pre-eminence of these conferences in the playoff era — three of the four national champions since the playoff began have come from the A.C.C. or the SEC — is a result of geography, investment and the unique dominance of Nick Saban’s Alabama.But there may be another significant cause. The three leagues that have missed the playoff entirely at least once — the Big 12, the Big Ten and the Pacific-12 — are also the three that play nine-game rather than eight-game conference schedules. The extra strain of the in-conference gauntlet might have something to do with the phenomenon.The Pac-12 is the most glaring example: It condemns its teams to those nine-game conference schedules, and two of its best programs, Stanford and Southern California, also play Notre Dame annually. In the playoff’s first season, Condoleezza Rice, then a selection committee member, worried that the Pac-12 was committing “fratricide.”Already this season, Stanford defeated Oregon, Utah defeated Stanford, Washington defeated Utah, Oregon defeated Washington, Washington State defeated Oregon and Southern California defeated Washington State. Depending on how one views it, the Pac-12 is either a circle of good teams blocking the rise of a great one, or a morass of mediocrity finding its appropriate level and results.The debate received more fuel on Saturday as Coach Mike Leach’s Washington State Cougars, who run the pass-happy, explosive Air Raid offense and are exceedingly fun to watch, found their groove in the first half of their showcase game against Oregon. The Cougars jumped to a 27-0 lead.Leach’s teams tend to be poorly equipped for maintaining leads for the same reason they are so exciting: They pass often and struggle to milk the clock. Cougars quarterback Gardner Minshew entered the game averaging around 52 passes a game; on Saturday night, with a huge lead for much of the game, when a typical team would mostly run the ball, he threw 51 passes.That allowed the Ducks to narrow the deficit to 27-20 with a field goal midway through the fourth quarter.On Washington State’s next drive came a crucial play: Minshew tossed the ball deep to the double-covered freshman receiver Travell Harris. Oregon safety Jevon Holland appeared to intercept the ball, but Harris essentially yanked it away from Holland in midair and held on for a 37-yard gain. Several plays later, Minshew threw his fourth touchdown of the evening, icing the game for the home team.Fans rushed the field in Pullman as the Cougars improved to 6-1. The next day, they rose in the Associated Press poll to No. 14. (The Ducks dropped to 5-2 and No. 19).But that makes Washington State the Pac-12’s last one-loss team, having played among its weakest schedules. The Cougars have to go to No. 24 Stanford (5-2) on Saturday, then Colorado (5-2) two weeks later. It seems likely that for a second straight year — and the third out of five — the Pac-12 will miss the playoff.A tougher in-conference schedule was the Big Ten’s doom last year: Ohio State, the eventual champion, was shellacked, 55-24, in Iowa City by a Hawkeyes squad that finished 8-5 and ended up as the first team left out of the playoff bracket.Not that the undefeated Buckeyes had anything to worry about this season, when, on Saturday night, they traveled to West Lafayette, Ind. Purdue was 3-3. No problem. Right?Wrong. Purdue beat up the Buckeyes, 49-20, dropping them to 7-1 and No. 11. Iowa and Purdue are in the division opposite Ohio State’s, meaning that Ohio State does not play them annually, and each of those losses represented that ninth conference game that A.C.C. and SEC teams do not play.Ohio State’s loss makes this year’s annual game against No. 5 Michigan (7-1), which took the Paul Bunyan Trophy back from Michigan State on Saturday, a very big deal. It’s in Columbus.Still, even that game’s winner, should it capture the Big Ten title the following week in Indianapolis, might be a long shot for the playoff considering the lineup of a potentially undefeated Clemson, whichever juggernaut emerges from the SEC, a likely one-loss Big 12 champion and maybe-undefeated Notre Dame, currently No. 3 and 7-0. Plus, don’t forget No. 10 Central Florida! 7-0!When a seemingly deserving contender is left out this year, the calls will be loud for an expanded playoff: six teams, even eight. (The current contract, which calls for four teams, runs through 2026.)But if the postseason is enlarged, giving every team a wider margin for error and making each game count a little less, what would everyone fret and argue over in late October?"
"Tua Tagovailoa threw five touchdown passes and ran for a score, leading No. 1 Alabama (12-0, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) to a victory at home over rival Auburn (7-5, 3-5) on Saturday.The Crimson Tide, who are also No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings, led by just 17-14 at halftime but took over with an explosive third quarter, when the Heisman Trophy contender Tagovailoa threw three long touchdown passes. He is the first Alabama player to have a hand in six touchdowns in a game and matched a program record with the five scoring passes.Tagovailoa finished 25 of 32 for 324 yards and ran for 26 yards, including a 7-yard touchdown and a 21-yard third-down conversion. Alabama heads to the SEC championship game against No. 5 Georgia with a guaranteed playoff spot on the line.“I thought Tua was into it,” Alabama Coach Nick Saban said. “His leadership was really important for our offense. Don’t ask me why, but it doesn’t seem like we had the right kind of energy in the first half.”Trevor Lawrence threw for a career-high 393 yards, Adam Choice rushed for three touchdowns, and No. 2 Clemson capped a perfect regular season with a victory at home over South Carolina, the Gamecocks’ fifth consecutive win in the rivalry.The Tigers reached 12-0 for the second time in four seasons and for the third time in program history, starting with its 1981 national title season. Clemson, also No. 2 in the playoff rankings, kept pace for another title run with its latest success over the Gamecocks (6-5).Jake Bentley had career highs with 510 yards, the second most ever allowed by Clemson, and five touchdowns for South Carolina. The Tigers had not given up that many points in 28 games since a 42-35 victory over Virginia Tech in the 2016 Atlantic Coast Conference title game.Ian Book passed for 352 yards, Dexter Williams went 52 yards on a go-ahead touchdown run, and No. 3 Notre Dame completed an unbeaten regular season and most likely secured a spot in the playoff with a victory at longtime rival Southern California (5-7).Chris Finke caught an early touchdown pass for the Fighting Irish (12-0), No. 3 in the playoff rankings, who showed playoff-level tenacity in rallying from an early 10-point deficit, their largest of the season. Tony Jones Jr. then took a short pass 51 yards for a touchdown with just over three minutes to play, finishing off Notre Dame’s 10th perfect regular season since 1945, the first since 2012.Notre Dame is all but certain to be chosen for the four-team playoff, and this win could keep the Irish away from powerhouse Alabama in the first postseason game.Jake Fromm threw a career-best four touchdown passes, D’Andre Swift ran for 105 yards, and No. 5 Georgia (11-1) romped into next week’s meeting with Alabama in the SEC championship game with a rout of visiting Georgia Tech (7-5).Georgia, No. 5 in the playoff rankings, went to the locker room with a 38-7 lead. The Bulldogs held a 343-66 edge in total yards, piling up 18 first downs to Georgia Tech’s four. Fromm completed 13 of 16 passes for 175 yards before giving way to Justin Fields late in the third quarter.Juanyeh Thomas provided Georgia Tech’s only points in the first half on a 100-yard kickoff return.Feleipe Franks had three touchdown passes, and No. 13 Florida (9-3) used a punishing ground attack to end a streak of five losses to host Florida State (5-7).Lamical Perine had a 74-yard touchdown run as Florida, No. 11 in the playoff rankings, ran for 278 yards, averaging 5.3 yards per carry. Perine ran for 129 yards, averaging 9.9 yards. Florida had 536 offensive yards and reinforced its case for an at-large spot in a New Year’s Six bowl game. Franks completed 16 of 26 passes for 254 yards.Trace McSorley completed 12 of 22 passes for 230 yards and had a hand in three touchdowns, helping No. 15 Penn State (9-3, 6-3 Big Ten) rout visiting Maryland (5-7, 3-6).McSorley added 64 rushing yards on 11 carries for the Nittany Lions, who are No. 12 in the playoff rankings. He threw a 34-yard bullet through freezing rain to K J Hamler on the game’s first play, sprinted downfield to throw a block that opened Miles Sanders up for a 35-yard run on the next, then skipped into the end zone from 3 yards out to cap the quick opening drive.Terry Wilson accounted for 340 yards and four touchdowns, Benny Snell Jr. rushed for two scores, and No. 17 Kentucky (9-3) routed its archrival Louisville (2-10), winning the Governor’s Cup on the road.The Wildcats scored touchdowns on all five first-half drives and never trailed in posting their first nine-win regular season since 1977. Wilson completed 17 of 23 passes for 261 yards and rushed for 79 yards in his biggest game with Kentucky.Eric Dungey threw for 362 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another three scores, leading No. 19 Syracuse (9-3, 6-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) over host Boston College (7-5, 4-4).Dungey, who left last week’s game against No. 3 Notre Dame clutching his lower back, is the third player in program history to account for six scores in a game; the first was the Hall of Famer Jim Brown. With 32 running and passing touchdowns this year, Dungey also passed Donovan McNabb for the Syracuse single-season record.Clayton Thorson accounted for three touchdowns, Isaiah Browser rushed for 166 yards on 18 carries, and No. 20 Northwestern (8-4, 8-1) beat visiting Illinois (4-8, 2-7) for its seventh straight Big Ten win.Travis Homer rushed for 168 yards and a long touchdown, DeeJay Dallas ran back a punt for one of his two scores, and host Miami (7-5, 4-4 A.C.C.) closed its regular season by knocking off No. 24 Pittsburgh (7-5, 6-2). Dallas also had a rushing touchdown.David Montgomery ran for three touchdowns, including the winner with about four and a half minutes to go, and 25th-ranked Iowa State (7-4, 6-3 Big 12) rallied from 17 points down in the fourth quarter and stunned visiting Kansas State (5-7, 3-6), ending a streak of 10 losses to the Wildcats.? Michigan State (7-5, 5-4 Big Ten) edged visiting Rutgers (1-11, 0-9), 14-10, handing the Scarlet Knights their 11th straight loss. Patrick Hobbs, athletic director at Rutgers, said after the game that Coach Chris Ash, who is 7-29 in three seasons there, would return next season.? Temple (8-4, 7-1 American Athletic Conference) routed host Connecticut, 57-7, and the Huskies finished the season with several records for defensive futility. The Huskies (1-11, 0-8) gave up the most yards (7,409), the most yards per game (617.4), the most points (605) and the most points per game (50.41) in a single season of any major college football team in N.C.A.A. history. ? Southeast Missouri (9-3) claimed its first Football Championship Subdivision playoff victory ever, scoring all of its points in the third quarter in a 28-14 first-round win at home over Stony Brook (7-5). The Seawolves, making their fourth F.C.S. playoff appearance, outgained the Redhawks by 404 yards to 240 but turned the ball over four times, with three of those miscues leading to touchdowns.? In other F.C.S. playoff games, Duquesne (9-3) defeated host Towson (7-5), 31-10, and Wofford (9-3) won at home over Elon (6-5), 19-7. James Madison (9-3) beat visiting Delaware (7-5), 20-6, and host Montana State (8-4) topped Incarnate Word (6-5), 35-14. Nicholls State (9-3) defeated visiting San Diego (9-3), 49-30; Jacksonville State (9-3) won at home over East Tennessee State (8-4), 34-27; and host Northern Iowa (7-5) topped Lamar (7-5), 16-13."
"Do we need 40 bowl games? The Cure Bowl? The First Responder Bowl? Come on, the Cheez-It Bowl?Well, this year maybe we do, with the legalization of sports betting in many areas. For some Americans, 2018 is the first chance to sit and watch two teams they have barely heard of, and really care, because they have a bet riding on it.Here’s a look at the bowl lineup for the hard-core fans, with betting lines for those who may want to gamble a buck or two.New Orleans Bowl: Appalachian State (-7) vs. Middle Tennessee.Camellia Bowl: Eastern Michigan (-3½) vs. Georgia Southern.Las Vegas Bowl: No. 21 Fresno State (-3) vs. Arizona State.Cure Bowl: Louisiana-Lafayette vs. Tulane (-3½).New Mexico Bowl: North Texas vs. Utah State (-10½).Tulane is one of several teams that limped into a bowl with a 6-6 record. Still, the Green Wave is favored over Louisiana-Lafayette (7-6).Appalachian State is 3-0 in bowl games since transitioning to the top level in 2013. It did lose in games like the Burley Bowl and the Pythian Bowl for small colleges back in the 1950s.Dec. 18, Boca Raton Bowl: Alabama-Birmingham (-2) vs. Northern Illinois.Alabama-Birmingham reinstated football after a two-year hiatus and immediately qualified for a bowl game, losing to Ohio in the Bahamas Bowl last year. This year, it won Conference USA. On the other hand, that is the worst rated of the 10 major conferences, even lower than the Mid-American Conference, which Northern Illinois won.Despite throwing four touchdown passes in a stirring comeback in the championship game, Marcus Childers of Northern Illinois has an adjusted-yards-per-attempt figure of 4.5, the worst among bowl quarterbacks.Dec. 19, Frisco Bowl: Ohio (-4½) vs. San Diego State.San Diego State was 3-9 against the spread this season, tied for the worst record among bowl teams.Dec. 20, Gasparilla Bowl: Marshall vs. South Florida (-2).South Florida won its first seven games, creeping into the top 25, and then lost its last five. Marshall has the best bowl record (11-2) of any team with 10 or more appearances.Dec. 21, Idaho Potato Bowl: Brigham Young (-11) vs. Western Michigan. Bahamas Bowl: Florida International vs. Toledo (-6).B.Y.U. was just 6-6, but its independent schedule (Washington, California, Utah, Utah State) was tougher than the MAC slate played by 7-5 Western Michigan.Hawaii Bowl: Hawaii (-2) vs. Louisiana Tech. Dollar General Bowl: Buffalo (-3½) vs. Troy.Armed Forces Bowl: Army vs. Houston (-3). Birmingham Bowl: Memphis (-2½) vs. Wake Forest.Army is locked into the Armed Forces Bowl despite having a game to play. (It is a 7-point favorite over Navy.) After a 1-point win over Navy last year, Army won the Armed Forces Bowl, defeating San Diego State, 42-35, as a touchdown underdog.Jeff Sagarin’s computer rates Hawaii the 115th best team, the worst to make a bowl this season. But home-state advantage makes them a slight favorite.Cheez-It Bowl: California (-1½) vs. Texas Christian. Quick Lane Bowl: Minnesota vs. Georgia Tech (-3½).First Responder Bowl: No. 25 Boise State (-3) vs. Boston College.Georgia Tech had 335 rushing yards a game, the best in the nation.Texas Bowl: Baylor vs. Vanderbilt (-2½). Pinstripe Bowl: Wisconsin vs. Miami (-3). Independence Bowl: Temple (-3) vs. Duke.Two 6-6 teams make the Texas Bowl the only game without a team with a winning record.Wisconsin started the season at No. 4 in the Associated Press poll and Miami at No. 8. But both teams wound up 7-5 (and Wisconsin was 3-9 against the spread).Alamo Bowl: No. 13 Washington State (-2) vs. No. 24 Iowa State. Camping World Bowl: No. 16 West Virginia (-6½) vs. No. 20 Syracuse. Music City Bowl: Auburn (-4½) vs. Purdue.Washington State was 10-2 against the spread this year, the best such record in college football. The season was tarnished a bit by a season-ending loss to Washington; the Cougars lost by 13 as a small favorite. Washington State threw for 379.8 passing yards a game, best in the nation.Peach Bowl: No. 7 Michigan (-7) vs. No. 10 Florida. Arizona Bowl: Arkansas State (-2) vs. Nevada.Belk Bowl: South Carolina (-6½) vs. Virginia.Florida is the highest ranked team that did not appear in the preseason A.P. top 25 poll. Michigan gave up 263 yards a game, the best defense in nation.South Carolina has five losses, all to elite teams: Georgia, Kentucky, Texas A&M, Florida and Clemson.Cotton Bowl: No. 2 Clemson (-10½) vs. No. 3 Notre Dame.Despite the big spread, the early money is coming in on Clemson in this battle of unbeatens. All season long, Alabama and Clemson have towered over everyone else in computer rankings.Orange Bowl: No. 1 Alabama (-13½) vs. No. 4 Oklahoma.How much do bookmakers like Alabama? Though they are playing the No. 4 team in the country, a 12-1 team with a dynamite offense, Alabama is favored by the biggest spread of any bowl game. And there has been so much early money on Alabama, the line could easily move to 14 soon.Last season, Alabama’s selection to the national semifinals as the fourth seed after not even winning its conference division raised some eyebrows. The bookies weren’t bothered. They made Alabama a 3½-point favorite over unbeaten and top-seeded Clemson, and Alabama won by 18. In the final, they were 4-point favorites over Georgia and won by 3 in overtime.The over/under on this game is a staggering 79, meaning the expected final score is something like 46-33, Alabama. That big number comes in part because Oklahoma racked up 578 yards a game and 8.8 yards a play, both best in the nation.Sun Bowl: Pittsburgh vs. Stanford (-6½). TaxSlayer Bowl: No. 19 Texas A&M (-4½) vs. North Carolina State. Holiday Bowl: No. 17 Utah (-7½) vs. No. 22 Northwestern. Liberty Bowl: No. 23 Missouri (-10) vs. Oklahoma State. Redbox Bowl: Michigan State vs. Oregon (-1½). Military Bowl: Cincinnati (-6½) vs. Virginia Tech.Jeff Sagarin says Pitt played the third toughest schedule in the country, trailing only U.C.L.A. and Tennessee, teams that did not make a bowl. Pitt lost to Penn State, Central Florida, Notre Dame and Clemson. (Less impressively, it lost to North Carolina and Miami.)Odds Shark reports that all the early money is on Texas A&M in its game.Michigan State gave up only 81 rushing yards a game, best in the nation.Cincinnati was 7-5 against the spread but covered by an average margin of 10.4 points, the best in college football, according to Teamrankings.com, helped by wins like 42-0 over Navy, 56-6 over East Carolina and 49-7 over Connecticut.Sugar Bowl: No. 5 Georgia (-10) vs. No. 15 Texas.These teams will be looking with some jealousy at Oklahoma: Georgia barely missed a playoff spot to the Sooners, and Texas lost to them in the Big 12 championship.The big spread is a product, in part, of the dominance of the Southeastern Conference. Eleven teams from the conference made a bowl: Nine of them are favored.Citrus Bowl: No. 12 Penn State (-4) vs. No. 14 Kentucky.Kentucky has been one of the year’s surprise teams, winning nine games for the first time since 1984. They will be going for a first bowl win since 2008.Outback Bowl: No. 18 Mississippi State (-5) vs. Iowa.Mississippi State gave up only 164 passing yards a game, best in the country.Rose Bowl: No. 6 Ohio State (-4½) vs. No. 9 Washington.Ohio State had a case to be in the playoff but was done in by an ugly loss to 6-6 Purdue. The 4½-point line looks more than realistic given that the Buckeyes are coming off a 21-point win over Northwestern and a 23-point win over Michigan.Fiesta Bowl: No. 8 Central Florida vs. No. 11 Louisiana State (-7½)The only bowl line in which the lower-ranked team is the favorite. Last season, Central Florida was also unbeaten and beat Auburn in the Peach Bowl by 7 despite being 10-point underdogs. Bettors think they could do it again; the early money is on Central Florida.Should form hold and the double-digit favorites Alabama and Clemson win their semifinals, oddsmakers say Alabama will be a 6-point favorite to win its third national championship in four years. If Notre Dame or Oklahoma slips in, the line could get very long."
"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — The Baltimore Ravens are the 7-6 team that absolutely no one in the N.F.L. wants to play in the postseason next month. In a copycat league, the defiant Ravens have become the feared, eccentric nonconformists — radical thinkers who make the rest of the league nervous and jumpy.With good reason.In the modern N.F.L., just about every team has made the passing game the principal focus of its offensive attack. Indeed, the deities of the league this season are quarterbacks, who routinely throw as many as 35 or 40 times a game. The high priest of the movement is Kansas City’s Pat Mahomes, who threw 53 passes last weekend against the Ravens.But about a month ago, Baltimore handed its starting quarterback job to Lamar Jackson, a rookie whose strength is running the football. Jackson had 26 carries and 119 rushing yards in his first game. Since then, the Ravens have become a 1970s throwback, running the football 60 percent of the time, or more, with Jackson leading the way.This iconoclastic strategy — it helps to also have the N.F.L.’s top-ranked defense — quickly produced a three-game Ravens win streak, which rescued the team’s season. And then, last weekend, in a featured, must-see game at Kansas City, the Ravens ran the football nearly 73 percent of the time in the first half, a stunning run/pass ratio for even a grind-it-out high school football team.The Ravens ended up outplaying Mahomes’s ascendant Chiefs for a good part of the game and had the lead late into the fourth quarter. Yes, Baltimore eventually lost by 3 points in overtime, but the result sent a thunderbolt through the rest of the league’s Super Bowl contenders, whose defensive coordinators simultaneously had the same thought:Wait, we might have to play these guys? And how far back do we have to go to find a defensive game plan for stopping a run-first team with a run-first quarterback?Or, as Tampa Bay Coach Dirk Koetter, whose team is the next Ravens opponent, said in the past week: “You can’t just reach down in your desk drawer and pull out the same defensive game plan from last week. This is a totally different deal. Totally.”Such angst is music to the ears of Baltimore Coach John Harbaugh, whose job seemed in jeopardy until Jackson became a starter in the wake of a hip injury to the longtime Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in early November. Harbaugh relishes opponents feeling uncomfortable as they prepare for his team.“When a team sees our style for the first time and doesn’t have a chance to work on it all throughout the year, of course it’s going to be challenging for them,” Harbaugh said, with a smile.Here’s how committed Harbaugh is to the recent changes he has made. Flacco, an 11-year Baltimore veteran and a Super Bowl most valuable player, is healthy again this week. Harbaugh was not moved; on Wednesday he announced that he was sticking with Jackson.The overarching question is whether the Ravens’ new offensive approach can be sustained. In the past, other N.F.L. teams have prospered, at least for periods of time, with running quarterbacks at the helm. But the prospect of serious injury to the most pivotal offensive player always loomed.There is a reason the average career of a top N.F.L. running back is years shorter than that of the average quarterback. Those who make it their primary job to run the football take a merciless pounding.Michael Vick, a four-time Pro Bowler from 2002 to 2010, holds the N.F.L. record for most rushing yards by a quarterback. Asked Tuesday if Jackson can run the football as frequently as he has so far and still avoid injury, Vick said:“I don’t think you can keep that pace up for the long term. This is a desperate situation; the Ravens needed to stack up some wins to save the season. Lamar and the Ravens are doing whatever they can to get to the playoffs.”But Vick, now a Fox analyst, would not tell Jackson to change his approach.“His style is why they drafted him, and you can get hurt standing in the pocket, too,” Vick said. “And let’s remember that almost every quarterback in the league is running and trying to be mobile.”Still, Vick insisted that at some point you have to limit the exposure to big hits.“You just don’t want to accumulate too much punishment; it adds up,” he said. “When you tuck the ball and run upfield, the chance for injury probably goes up 25 percent. You don’t want to risk that too often.”On Wednesday, Harbaugh admitted that running the football 60 percent of the time was a bit much.“That’s a high number,” he said, but he added with a little grin: “Hey, it could get higher, though, you never know — the way we’re playing and the way games go.”Harbaugh continued: “In Baltimore, running the football has always been a big part of the Ravens and a big part of our personality, too.”Emphasizing the ground game has other advantages. It’s easy to mount longer drives, which keeps the defense on the sideline and rested.“Anyone who doesn’t understand that a ball-control offense helps the defense, doesn’t really know football,” Baltimore safety Eric Weddle said. “When a defense is on the field for 20 percent less time than it normally is, it’s obvious the defense is going to play better.”And the Ravens’ commitment to the run is not solely based on Jackson’s forays on run-pass option plays or designed runs. Baltimore is giving the football to its running backs more often, too. While Jackson’s 71 rushing yards led Baltimore against Kansas City, his teammates Gus Edwards and Kenneth Dixon ran for 67 yards and 59 yards.In fact, the Ravens’ dominant ground game has seemed to lift the morale of the entire Baltimore roster. Guard Alex Lewis insisted the offensive linemen are delighted to spend more of their time aggressively charging forward in run-blocking schemes instead of protectively pass-blocking.“It’s human nature to want to go forward instead of going backward,” Lewis said. “And a good running game means you’re winning the battle up front in the trenches. It also wears out the opposition.“Late in games, you can see it in their eyes. They’re gassed.”Vick, in fact, wondered if the Ravens aren’t trendsetters.“Maybe this could be something that transforms the game, where more teams go to a run-oriented style,” Vick said. “I think that would be really cool, man.”They are the unconventional, even radical 7-6 Baltimore Ravens. The end of their run might not be predictable or successful, but no one wants to play them in January."
"“If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldn’t hit that door with your head,” says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. “Keep your head and neck out of the equation,” Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground — if you’re slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. “Your power comes from your legs and feet,” Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponent’s thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxer’s. Maintain momentum after contact.Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. “The technique is not skill-specific, and it’s not age-specific,” Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isn’t just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: “Some coaches love winning so much they’re willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad they’re willing to lose.”"
"Bob Costas, the longtime sportscaster and prime-time host on NBC, alleged in an interview that aired on Sunday that the network’s executives abruptly removed him from covering last year’s Super Bowl after he criticized the violence in football and how the “game destroys people’s brains.”His nearly 40-year relationship with NBC Sports, first as its boyish announcer and later as elder statesman, came crashing down over five days in November 2017. At a symposium that month with fellow journalists, Mr. Costas remarked on what he saw as the life-altering dangers of the sport, devastating consequences for its players and existential questions confronting the National Football League.“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains — not everyone’s, but a substantial number,” Mr. Costas told the crowd at the University of Maryland. “It’s not a small number, it’s a considerable number. It destroys their brains.”His highly critical remarks, while in line with his past public comments about the link between playing football and head trauma, including an hourlong NBC special about it in 2013, quickly grabbed headlines and cast an uncomfortable spotlight on NBC Sports just months before it would broadcast the N.F.L.’s biggest and most lucrative event, the Super Bowl.At the end of that week in November, Mr. Costas appeared on the CNN program “Smerconish” in what he later described as an effort to soften the reaction to his remarks. He said that network executives had been well aware of his thoughts about football and that “NBC Sports deserves credit” for supporting him as he expressed his views.Still, network executives were seething, according to Mr. Costas, setting in motion his removal from the network’s Super Bowl plan and his eventual departure from NBC. Mr. Costas spoke about the episode with ESPN last year for a story that aired Sunday on “Outside the Lines.”Within an hour of his appearance on CNN, he said, he received a text message from Sam Flood, an executive producer at NBC. “I think the words were, ‘You’ve crossed the line,’” Mr. Costas told ESPN, adding that he no longer had the text message.Mr. Costas told ESPN that he believed his remarks had cut too close to the delicate, multibillion-dollar business relationship between the N.F.L. and the networks that carry the games.“Look, the N.F.L. isn’t just the most important sports property, it’s the single most important property in all of American television,” Mr. Costas said. “And it isn’t even close.”An NBC Sports spokesman confirmed that Mr. Costas had been told that he had “crossed the line” but said it was not because he had discussed the topic of brain injuries and football. Instead, the spokesman said, it was because Mr. Costas had agreed after the University of Maryland symposium that he would no longer discuss the topic in interviews without prior approval from NBC Sports.He had not sought approval for the CNN interview, the spokesman, Greg Hughes, said on Monday.Shortly after the CNN appearance, Mr. Costas said, he was told he would not be part of NBC’s coverage of Super Bowl LII in February 2018. It was a sudden breakup between NBC and Mr. Costas, its longtime host of the Olympics and of “Football Night in America,” the network’s highly rated Sunday N.F.L. pregame show. Last year, he described the separation in public as “mutually agreeable.”The parting was the culmination of Mr. Costas’s wavering commitment over many years to covering the N.F.L. He stepped away from NBC’s coverage in the 1990s, later saying the decision was because he “had ambivalent feelings about football.” Yet he was a host of HBO’s “Inside the N.F.L.” in the 2000s and then rejoined NBC’s coverage of the sport in the 2006-7 season, when the network started a $600 million-a-year deal with the league for Sunday night games. He continued hosting that program, “Sunday Night Football,” for the next decade, as awareness about the long-term effects of head injuries continued to rise.During that time, Mr. Costas used the top-rated show’s platform to provide commentary on everything from guns to politics. In a halftime commentary in 2012, Mr. Costas called for “enlightened legislation and controls” on guns a day after a Kansas City Chiefs player shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself.The network never received criticism or complaints from the N.F.L. about Mr. Costas’s coverage or commentary, including his remarks at the 2017 symposium, Mr. Hughes said.By the time Mr. Costas appeared at that event, he had already taken a back seat in NBC’s coverage. He hosted the first “Football Night in America” of the 2017-18 football season but then handed off the remaining shows to Mike Tirico, who had moved over from ESPN to become NBC’s face of major sports events. When NBC eventually announced that Mr. Costas would not participate in the Super Bowl broadcast, he said that it would not have been fair to those who had been there the entire season.“It wouldn’t be right for me to parachute in and do the Super Bowl,” he told The Associated Press weeks before the event. NBC and Mr. Costas officially parted ways last fall, when they agreed to end his contract early."
"Ohio State’s football coach, Urban Meyer, returned from a three-game suspension with a splash on Monday, insisting that he did not lie about when he learned of a domestic assault allegation against a former assistant coach and that he has always had zero tolerance for violence against women.In his first news conference since the university suspended him for his handling of Zach Smith, the former assistant, Meyer also said that he had never deleted text messages or changed the settings on his phone to prevent records from coming to light — contrary to the implications of an independent report commissioned by Ohio State.Anyone who expected Meyer to return to the sidelines quietly would have been caught off guard by the past 24 hours, which have included an interview that aired on ESPN, a statement posted to his Twitter feed and a nearly one-hour news conference in Columbus, Ohio.Meyer was put on administrative leave at the beginning of August while the university pursued an investigation into what he knew about the allegations against Smith and what Meyer had disclosed about them. Meyer was then suspended through the beginning of the season, including the Buckeyes’ first three games, all of which they won.“It’s clear I could have done a better job,” he said in the Twitter statement on Monday morning.He added, “I want to be clear: I do not — never have and never will — condone domestic abuse.”The appearances constituted Meyer’s first public comments since a brief news conference on Aug. 22 after the announcement of his suspension and a statement he released two days later in which he explicitly apologized to Smith’s ex-wife, Courtney.On Monday, he again apologized to Courtney Smith, but he appeared to stop short of endorsing her version of events. Courtney Smith has said that her ex-husband assaulted her multiple times; Zach Smith has denied ever doing so. There are police reports from 2009 and 2015, but Zach Smith was never prosecuted.“I’m very sorry,” Meyer said Monday. “No two children and a wife, or a family, should go through this.”Asked whether he believed Courtney Smith is a domestic violence victim, he said, “I can only rely on what information I received from the experts.”Meyer gave a fuller account of his decision to hire Zach Smith after becoming Ohio State’s head coach in late 2011. He said that he had consulted with the two coaches for whom Smith had worked after his tenure working for Meyer at Florida and said that Smith “got really high marks.” (The two head coaches, Doc Holliday at Marshall and Steve Addazio at Temple, had both previously served on Meyer’s staff.)And Meyer said that after a poor season of coaching in 2015, Smith had rebounded in 2016 and 2017. Meyer said he had frequently seen Courtney Smith and the couple’s two children. The Smiths divorced in 2016, but Meyer said Zach Smith had told him that his relationship with his ex-wife was good.Smith “had a great year in ’17,” Meyer said Monday, “and actually had some job offers this year to move on, and made the decision to stay here to be near his kids.”Meyer repeated what he had told the investigators, which is that in 2009 — when he was Florida’s head coach, and Zach Smith was an assistant there — the Smiths had come to him and conveyed that the alleged domestic assault had not been domestic assault. Investigators found discrepancies in other accounts and cast doubt as to whether that meeting happened.In July, the independent journalist Brett McMurphy reported that Zach Smith had been charged earlier this year with misdemeanor trespassing and that Courtney Smith had a restraining order against him. The next day, Meyer fired Zach Smith, and he said at the Big Ten media days that he had not heard about a 2015 incident in which Smith had been accused of domestic assault.The following week, McMurphy reported that Meyer’s wife, Shelley, had been aware of that incident and that Meyer had confronted Smith about it. Ohio State placed Meyer on administrative leave, and the board of trustees initiated an investigation. Meyer soon clarified that he had misspoken — he said on Monday that he had not listened to the question carefully enough — and that he had known about the incident.In mid-August, the investigation concluded, and President Michael V. Drake suspended Meyer for six weeks, without pay, and three games. (Athletic Director Gene Smith was suspended for two weeks.) The review found that Meyer had failed to notify other university officers about the domestic violence allegations against Zach Smith as well as other red flags regarding Smith, including poor job performance, delinquent credit card payments and an illicit visit to a strip club during a recruiting trip.The investigation found that Meyer’s loyalty to Smith’s grandfather, Earle Bruce — a former Ohio State head coach who hired Meyer for his first job in college football — had distorted his judgment. Meyer agreed with that assessment.With Ryan Day, one of Ohio State’s offensive coordinators, as interim head coach, the fourth-ranked Buckeyes amassed a 3-0 record, including a win on Saturday over No. 17 Texas Christian. They host Tulane on Saturday before going on the road to face No. 10 Penn State on Sept. 29."
"STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — As Ohio State and Penn State warmed up before their Big Ten clash Saturday evening, the Beaver Stadium video screen showed the final minutes of the game between Michigan and Northwestern. The Wolverines, ranked 14th, were trailing the one-win Wildcats, and tens of thousands of Nittany Lions fans packing the stadium, along with the smattering of Buckeyes supporters, pondered whether to root for a maize-and-blue comeback.It would seem to be obvious: Root for Northwestern! The Michigan-Ohio State rivalry is one of the most enduring in sports. And for Ohio State and Penn State alike, Michigan is an annual obstacle to winning the Big Ten East, playing for a conference championship and qualifying for the four-team College Football Playoff.Yet the 110,000-plus fans in Happy Valley were compelled to root for Michigan, whose fourth-quarter touchdown secured a 20-17 victory that improved its record to 4-1.Why? It is in the best interests of every conference’s best teams for their conference’s best teams to do well. And this may hold especially true for the Big Ten.The Buckeyes (5-0, 2-0) dispatched Penn State, 27-26. “We’ve gotten to a point where we are great, and we’re comfortable with being great,” Penn State Coach James Franklin said after the game. “That’s the issue. We haven’t broken through with these types of programs yet.”Now Buckeyes fans will have to root for No. 15 Michigan (4-1, 2-0) as well as No. 20 Michigan State (3-1, 1-0), No. 16 Wisconsin (3-1, 1-0) and, of course, No. 11 Penn State (4-1, 1-1) to do well in all their other games to buttress No. 3 Ohio State’s own playoff résumé. Such is college football in 2018.As Ohio State saw last season, winning the Big Ten is not synonymous with making the playoff: The two-loss Buckeyes won the conference championship game but then were left out of the playoff, as the committee slotted in two Southeastern Conference teams — who ended up contesting the national title.This season, the Big Ten may be more cutthroat than ever. The structure of the playoff — four teams, five power conferences — already guarantees that at least one conference will be left out.This year’s potential inclusion of No. 6 Notre Dame (5-0), a conference-less program that defeated Stanford Saturday night, 38-17, in what will most likely be its toughest matchup of the season, would cut out at least one more power conference. An undefeated Notre Dame is a shoo-in.And let us not forget Central Florida of the American Athletic Conference, one of the so-called Group of Five. Last year’s self-proclaimed national champion, Central Florida is 4-0 and ranked 12th, with a win over Pitt and the opportunity to defeat well-regarded South Florida and Cincinnati. Central Florida will need to run the table and get help, but stranger things have happened.Ohio State’s margin for error is narrow because all of its potential opponents have at least one loss. Wisconsin, winner of its division five of the last seven years, lost to Brigham Young (3-2) at home. Michigan State lost to Arizona State (3-2) on the road. Michigan’s only loss came at Notre Dame in the season opener, which means the 115th Ohio State-Michigan rivalry game, in Columbus, may yet hold playoff implications, though Michigan looked far from playoff-worthy Saturday.The precarious situation is familiar for the conference. The SEC is the dominant league of the playoff era: It is one of only two conferences to send a member to the postseason in all four years of the playoff’s existence; the only league to send two teams in the same year; and is the winner, via Alabama, of two titles. But the Big Ten has been the playoff era’s protagonist, alternately victorious and frustrated, and representing the delicate competitive atmosphere.For all its heritage and justified pride, the Big Ten has struggled in football in recent years (and historically in the Rose Bowl) as the sport’s center of gravity and talent pool has steadily shifted south. In the 20 years of a unified postseason, the Big Ten has captured just two national titles — both by Ohio State.The four years of the playoff have featured particularly vertiginous ups and downs. The 2014 season saw the Buckeyes sneak into the playoff with a third-string quarterback — and then defeat Alabama and Oregon on the way to the title. The following season, a Spartans team with miraculous wins at Michigan (the blocked punt) and Ohio State met Alabama and got demolished. The following year, the eventual champion, Clemson, drubbed Ohio State, 31-0. Last year was the greatest disaster yet, with no Big Ten members in the playoff at all.And yet the Big Ten has arguably possessed the most depth at the top. In the playoff committee’s final rankings, it has had more top-ten teams than even the SEC; in 2016, four of its teams were in the top ten, compared to just Alabama from the SEC. With Urban Meyer at Ohio State, Jim Harbaugh at Michigan and James Franklin at Penn State, its marquee programs have historically successful coaches, while Michigan State and Wisconsin perennially punch above their weight.If Ohio State does make it to the playoff, it will have run quite a gantlet, with games versus Michigan State and Michigan still to come in November. Ditto Michigan, whose loss to Notre Dame could be forgiven if the Irish turn out to have beaten everyone else, too.Even Penn State could still compile an impressive record, although unlike its conference rivals it will not have had to surmount perhaps the Big Ten’s biggest challenge: winning at Penn State.Meyer acknowledged after Saturday’s game that the hostile environment was among the game’s most challenging features.“There were times where I looked up, saw those white pom-poms,” Meyer said. “I thought it was all over.”"
"I’m pleased that the New England Patriots made it to the A.F.C. championship game again this year. On Sunday, they’ll play the Kansas City Chiefs at 6:40 p.m., and the winner will advance to the Super Bowl.I’ve been a Patriots fan my entire life, long before they were good enough to loathe. But I won’t be watching football this weekend. I haven’t watched a single pass or tackle all season.I don’t remember much about last year’s A.F.C. championship game between the Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars. But I’ll never forget the sound.The Pats were down 14-3 with 1:23 left in the second quarter when the tight end Rob Gronkowski tried to catch a long, lofted pass from the quarterback, Tom Brady. He almost had it. But the Jags’ safety, Barry Church, hit Mr. Gronkowski just as he was pulling it down.Their hard plastic helmets hit each other with such force that — even through the tinny speakers on my television — it sounded like a rifle shot. You can see and hear the collision here.It still echoes in my ears. As the sound of the hit faded into a commercial break, I realized with absolute certainty that I couldn’t watch football anymore. There aren’t enough yards to gain or Super Bowl rings to win that are worth the cost.To use a euphemism from the era before we knew about brain damage, Mr. Gronkowski “got his bell rung.” Shaken by the impact, he struggled to his feet, wobbled and was helped off the field with a concussion. Mr. Church was fined $24,309 by the N.F.L. for an illegal hit.“I hope he’s all right,” Mr. Church said after the game. “If you go low for the knees, you are considered a dirty player, and if you go high, they throw the flag at you. It’s a bang-bang play, and I was just trying to play football.”“It’s football,” Mr. Gronkowski later told the press. “It is what it is.”And that’s the problem.The first research into the link between football and traumatic brain injury was published in 2005. Since then, the science has become impossible to ignore. In 2017, The Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of the autopsies of the brains of 111 deceased former N.F.L. players, whose relatives gave their bodies up for study. The group was not a random sample, yet 110 showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to concussions. Research published in November estimated that a minimum of 10 percent of all professional football players would develop C.T.E. at some point in their lives. Professional athletes are well compensated for their dangerous job. But the pipeline is a problem. It can take more than a decade of hard hits to make it to a college team or the pros.Research published in The Journal of Pediatrics last month found that concussion rates for youth football players were higher than previously reported. In all, some 5 percent of all youth football players receive concussions each year, a figure that may sound low, but compounds with each additional year of play. In 2017, a study found that playing football before age 12 doubled the risk of problems with behavioral regulation, apathy and executive functioning. It tripled the risk of elevated depression.It’s little wonder that lawmakers last year in New York, Illinois, California, Maryland and New Jersey introduced bills to ban or restrict youth tackle football.All this isn’t the snowflaking of the next generation of American men. It’s physics. Technology — in the form of, say, better helmets — will not save the game. Researchers note that helmets don’t prevent all concussions and might be making the problem worse, by giving players a false sense of invincibility.The dangers of the game are clear to the insurance companies that cover youth and professional leagues. An investigation published by ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” this week found that the insurance market for youth football is “fundamentally altering the economics of the sport, squeezing and even killing off programs faced with higher costs and a scarcity of available coverage.”“People say football will never go away, but if we can't get insurance, it will,” Jon Butler, the executive director of the youth football program Pop Warner, is reported to have said. The report said that the N.F.L. is also having problems finding companies willing to insure against head injuries.With no safe way to play — short of flag football — it’s little wonder that participation in youth football is on the decline. Some high schools have dropped the sport altogether, while state legislatures are passing and updating concussion laws to ensure schools that do field teams take the issue seriously. Every state now has a concussion law on the books.Nor is it surprising that some younger N.F.L. players are calling it quits. Mr. Gronkowski, now 29, reportedly considered retirement after last season. Reports say he’s considering doing so after this one, too.There are still Newton deniers, who contest his laws of physics, which explain how the human brain slams into the interior walls of the skull during a concussion.“Your body gets used to the hits,” the Patriots’ Tom Brady told a sports radio show last month. “The brain understands the position that you are putting your body into, and my brain is wired for contact. I would say in some ways it has become callous to some of the hits.”Mr. Brady’s former teammate, Ted Johnson, spent 10 years in the N.F.L. and told The Times in 2007, at age 34, that he was suffering from symptoms characteristic of early Alzheimer’s disease as a results of concussions. “There's something wrong with my brain,” he said.Mr. Johnson called Mr. Brady’s recent remarks about concussions “irresponsible.” “I’ll be honest, and I love Tom, it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit,” he said.Despite all these concerns, there’s little indication that football will be dethroned as America’s favorite sport. Television ratings, which have taken some hard hits of their own over the past few years, have rebounded this season. And the Super Bowl might be the most communal experience the country has in 2019.This Sunday, I won’t begrudge my father, who’ll watch the game delayed on DVR, so he doesn’t have to endure commercials to get to the 11 minutes of action. Nor my cousin, who’ll bet money on the game. Seeing the occasional Patriots hat or jersey on the street is a nice reminder of the tribe I’ve parted ways with. Because as long as I can hear the sound of Gronk getting his bell rung, I’ll find something else to watch. "
"Long before Alabama — and now Clemson — rose as proud football powers, the 1899 University of the South football team, familiarly known as the Sewanee Tigers, provided a blueprint for Southern college football domination. Alabama and Clemson would surely crush the Tigers, but the copyright for how to dominate an era of college football would probably belong to Sewanee, not Alabama or its opponent in Monday night’s national championship game, Clemson.[Alabama vs. Clemson: Follow our live coverage from the national championship game]The idealization of the football player in the South? The idea of tying a Southern university’s identity to football? They go back at least as far as Sewanee. The pursuit of money to keep a college football program greased for greatness? That is another trademark at least 119 years old.The Crimson Tide can capture their sixth national title in 10 years with a win over Clemson on Monday in Santa Clara, Calif. Clemson beat Alabama two years ago, and this is the third time the two teams have met for the championship in four years.But Sewanee, Tenn., a small town on the Cumberland Plateau, created the template for the flush, modern, Southern football powerhouse, and it has been used time and again in the past 60 years, reaching its apotheosis at Alabama under Coach Nick Saban. Sewanee was led by one of the first forward thinkers of Southern football, Luke Lea (pronounced LEE), its 22-year-old team manager. The equivalent of an athletic director today, Lea put together a five-game, six-day, 2,300-mile trip by train through the South because he needed money to finance the 1899 team, and barnstorming was the only way to get it.While most college teams were playing four or five games a season, Sewanee played 12. Lea scheduled moneymaking games against the University of Texas and Texas A&M at the front end of the trip and games with Tulane, Louisiana State and the University of Mississippi on the back end.“Luke Lea’s canniness and caginess is what made that program possible,” said Woody Register, a history professor at the University of the South who has researched the 1899 team. “It connects him to generations of program designers.”Lea, who became a United States senator at age 32, is considered the first to come up with the idea of having trainers on road trips to take care of the players and massage their weary legs back into playing shape. He created a team that was a merciless bully: The Tigers were 12-0 and outscored opponents, 322-10. Sewanee could not pass the football, as per the rules of the day, and it would be no match for Alabama or Clemson. The team was also entirely white. The first African-American student to graduate from Sewanee, Nathaniel Owens, entered in 1966 and graduated in 1970. He was an outstanding football player. Nonetheless, Norman Jetmundsen Jr., a Birmingham lawyer who is putting together a documentary on the Sewanee team, is certain today’s elite teams would be impressed with the Tigers.“They played 35 consecutive minutes a half on both sides of the ball with no substitution, and they played with serious injuries,” Jetmundsen said. “They played five games in six days on that train trip and won them all by shutout. Who wouldn’t be impressed by that?”In a chapter of a book on the history of Sewanee, Register wrote that the 1899 team “formed part of the university’s heritage.” The professor said that Benjamin Lawton Wiggins, the university’s vice chancellor at the time, in particular, rallied students around the notion that football should be a part of the Southern male’s identity. At the time, the South was desperate for cheer, and Sewanee’s success was seen as a response to the aristocratic Northerners of the day, who thought they owned the game. Football was something Southerners could excel at, especially in the aftermath of defeat in the Civil War and economic depression, said George Rable, an American historian.“The 1890s were a rough time for the nation economically, but especially for the South,” Rable said. “Football provided some comfort and sense of achievement.” The Tigers lived by the notion that football players required a roughneck quality and a deep resolve. Jetmundsen said halfback Henry Seibels, who was known as Diddy, suffered a gash on his head in the game with Texas, but continued playing when the wound was covered with quick-setting plaster. Lineman Wild Bill Claiborne played with an eye patch, ostensibly to protect an injury. He would look across at his opponent, gesture to the patch, and declare: “This is what happened in the last game. Let’s see what happens today.”Fullback Ormond Simkins wore heavy knee braces as he battered into the line. His legs were eventually amputated below the knee because of football injuries.When the Southeastern Conference was created in 1932, Sewanee was a charter member, even though its days of being a powerhouse were long over. Inclusion was a tribute to the 1899 Tigers, a team for which Alabama’s Saban is a worthy descendant. Saban was the first coach in the SEC to consistently adopt a season-opening game in a neutral, big city for money and exposure when Alabama played Clemson in Atlanta in 2008. Now, marquee matchups at the start of the season are a regular occurrence across college football. Saban is also the primary fund-raiser for football facilities on campus, which are among the best nationally. He knows what Lea did — success requires money. “There is a connection between then and now because there is a significant money element at the center of the sport, and money is an unavoidable element of the game of college football,” Register said. “To have a mighty program, and be the champions of the South, which was their real aspiration, that required money.”Saban has been a catalyst for football programs, Clemson among them, to add layers and layers of support staff, more than a century after Sewanee added trainers. And the Crimson Tide (13-0) are as merciless as they come. They outscored opponents by 33.1 points a game this season, the biggest margin in the country. Clemson was second at 30.6. Alabama and college football, in general, have become symbols of pride in the New South. As in 1899, Rable said, “there is still a sectional quality to the football” that has its roots in the sentiments created by the Civil War. If a team from the Southeastern Conference is throttling a team from another conference, he added, “you can hear chants of ‘SEC, SEC, SEC.’”The ghosts of the Sewanee Tigers, nicknamed the Ironmen, would surely approve."
"Josh Jacobs ran for a touchdown and caught a scoring pass, and No. 1 Alabama (10-0, 7-0 Southeastern Conference) won at home Saturday for a second straight shutout, this one over No. 18 Mississippi State (6-4, 2-4).With quarterback Tua Tagovailoa still battling a sore right knee, the Crimson Tide, who are also No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings, turned to defense for another vintage performance. The offense raced to a fast start but mostly stalled afterward against the Bulldogs, who have the No. 2 scoring defense in the Football Bowl Subdivision.“I think in this day and age, you not only get judged on whether you win but you get judged on how you win,” Tide Coach Nick Saban said. “I never thought I’d ever be in position to say that you get style points, but the way our system is, that may be the way it is.”Trevor Lawrence threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score, and No. 2 Clemson (10-0, 7-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) knocked Boston College quarterback Anthony Brown out of the game early on the way to routing the 17th-ranked Eagles (7-3, 4-2) on the road.The Tigers wrapped up a fourth straight trip to the A.C.C. title game as the Atlantic Division champions and kept rolling toward another trip to the playoff. They are No. 2 in the playoff rankings.B.C. lost Brown, a sophomore, on its first possession when he was thrown to the turf by the star defensive tackle Christian Wilkins. The team did not immediate disclose the nature of Brown’s injury.Brandon Wimbush threw three-first half touchdown passes, Dexter Williams ran for a career-high 202 yards and No. 3 Notre Dame (10-0) took advantage of turnovers by visiting Florida State (4-6).Wimbush, who led the Irish to their first three victories, started in place of the injured junior Ian Book, who sustained a rib injury last week against Northwestern. Wimbush completed 12 of 25 passes for 130 yards, with scoring throws to two other seniors: a 3-yarder to wide receiver Miles Boykin and 6-and 15-yard tosses to tight end Alize Mack.Williams carried 20 times, including touchdown runs of 58 and 32 yards. Notre Dame, No. 3 in the playoff rankings, outgained Florida State by 495 yards to 322, 365 of those yards on the ground.Shea Patterson threw for 260 yards and three touchdowns, Karan Higdon ran for two 1-yard scores, and No. 4 Michigan (9-1, 7-0 Big Ten) kept its playoff hopes intact with a victory at Rutgers (1-9, 0-7).The Wolverines, who are No. 4 in the playoff rankings, have won nine straight games and remain in first place in the East Division. They have a tuneup against Indiana next week at the Big House before closing the regular season at No. 8 Ohio State. Michigan has not lost since the season opener against Notre Dame and would have to beat the Buckeyes for the second time in 15 years to keep any hope at a title alive.No. 5 Georgia struck for two touchdowns late in the first half. and D’Andre Swift finished off Auburn (6-4, 3-4 SEC) with a 77-yard scoring run early in the fourth quarter, leading the Bulldogs (9-1, 7-1) to a victory at home over their oldest rival.Swift rushed for 186 yards, powering another big game by Georgia’s running attack, which finished with 303 yards. Having already locked up a spot in the conference championship game, the Bulldogs, No. 5 in the playoff rankings, could not afford to slip up against the Tigers, No. 24 in the playoff rankings. They did not, though it took Georgia a while to get going.Kyler Murray passed for 349 yards and ran for 66, and No. 6 Oklahoma (9-1, 6-1 Big 12) survived a late 2-point conversion attempt and beat visiting Oklahoma State (5-5, 2-5).Taylor Cornelius connected with Tylan Wallace on a 24-yard touchdown pass that cut Oklahoma’s lead to a point with 1 minute 3 seconds to play. Oklahoma State went for 2, but Cornelius threw short and into coverage, and the pass fell incomplete. Oklahoma, which is also No. 6 in the playoff rankings, recovered the onside kick and ran out the clock.Drue Chrisman kept Michigan State pinned back with a sensational second half of punting, and eighth-ranked Ohio State (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten) eventually pulled away for a victory on the road over the 24th-ranked Spartans (6-4, 4-3).The Buckeyes, who are No. 10 in the playoff rankings, held a huge advantage in field position during the second half. Chrisman’s punts caused Michigan State, No. 18 in the playoff rankings, to start its first five drives after halftime from its own 5-, 6-, 3-, 1- and 2-yard lines.Will Grier threw three touchdown passes, and No. 7 West Virginia (8-1, 6-1 Big 12) rolled to a victory at home over Texas Christian (4-6, 2-5).West Virginia, which is No. 9 in the playoff rankings, had no trouble against the injury-riddled Horned Frogs as it closed in on a potential berth in the conference championship game with two regular-season games left.Joe Burrow completed 15 of 21 passes for 195 yards and a touchdown, and the defense dominated while leading No. 9 Louisiana State (8-2, 5-2 SEC) to a victory at Arkansas (2-8, 0-6).The win came a week after L.S.U. was shut out by No. 1 Alabama, and the Tigers have not lost back-to-back games since they dropped three straight in 2015.Gardner Minshew II overcame a slow start and three fourth-down failures, leading No. 10 Washington State (9-1, 6-1 Pacific-12) past host Colorado (5-5, 2-5). The Cougars, who are No. 8 in the playoff rankings, won their sixth straight game.McKenzie Milton threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third, helping No. 11 Central Florida (9-0, 6-0 American Athletic Conference) extend its winning streak, the longest in the F.B.S., to 22 games with a victory at home over Navy (2-8, 1-5). Milton completed 17 of 21 passes without an interception. The Knights are 12th in the latest C.F.P. rankings.Jarrett Guarantano threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Callaway on the final play of the first half, and Darrell Taylor had four sacks as host Tennessee (5-5, 2-4 SEC) trounced No. 12 Kentucky (7-3, 5-3). Tennessee beat Kentucky, which is No. 11 in the playoff rankings, at Neyland Stadium for a 17th straight time.Jordan Love threw for a career-high 491 yards and five touchdowns on 32-of-42 passing in just three quarters, and No. 14 Utah State (9-1, 6-0 Mountain West) totaled a program-record 804 yards in offense in a victory over visiting San Jose State (1-9, 1-5).Sam Ehlinger threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Lil’Jordan Humphrey with 21 seconds left, and No. 15 Texas (7-3, 5-2 Big 12) beat host Texas Tech (5-5, 3-4) after squandering a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter.Feleipe Franks silenced the home crowd twice with touchdown runs after being benched last week and being booed earlier in the game, and No. 19 Florida (7-3, 5-3 SEC), which is No. 15 in the playoff rankings, rallied to beat South Carolina (5-4, 4-4), ending a two-game losing streak.Trace McSorley tied the Penn State record for wins by a quarterback, and 21st-ranked Nittany Lions (7-3, 4-3 Big Ten) beat visiting Wisconsin (6-4, 4-3). McSorley completed 19 of 25 passes for 160 yards and a score while matching Todd Blackledge’s 29 victories from 1980-82.Brock Purdy threw for a touchdown and ran for another score, and No. 23 Iowa State (6-3, 5-2 Big 12) topped visiting Baylor (5-5, 3-4) after a skirmish in the third quarter resulted in unsportsmanlike-conduct penalties for every player on both teams.Michael Warren II ran for three touchdowns and caught a pass for an additional score, leading 25th-ranked Cincinnati (9-1, 5-1 American) to a victory at home over South Florida (7-4, 3-3) that kept the Bearcats in the chase for the A.A.C. title.? Collin Eaddy rushed for 266 yards and three touchdowns, and Ryan Quigley and John Lovett each had two touchdowns, leading Princeton (9-0, 6-0) to at least a share of an Ivy League championship with a 59-43 victory at Yale (5-4, 3-3).The Tigers, who have won nine straight for the first time since 1964, can take the title outright with a home win over Penn next weekend. The Tigers have won the Ivy League for a second time in three years.? Kyle Castner accounted for a program-record five touchdowns as Columbia (5-4, 2-4 Ivy) roared back from a 14-0 deficit and beat host Brown (1-8, 0-6), 42-20.? Geoff Wade threw for 135 yards and two touchdowns, and Holy Cross (4-6, 3-2 Patriot League) scored a 17-13 victory over visiting Fordham (1-9, 1-4).? Darnell Woolfolk rushed for 69 yards and two touchdowns, Calen Holt and Kelvin Hopkins Jr. each scored on short runs, and host Army (8-2) beat Lafayette (3-7), 31-13. It was the sixth straight victory for Army, which has won 12 in a row at home.? Ke’Mon Freeman and Xavier Jones each ran for more than 100 yards and combined for five touchdowns as visiting Southern Methodist (5-5, 4-2 American) moved one victory from bowl eligibility, outscoring Connecticut (1-9, 0-6), 62-50.? Jake Smith threw two touchdown passes to Brian Dunlap, and Harvard’s defense stuffed host Penn (6-3, 3-3 Ivy) in a 29-7 victory. Harvard (5-4, 3-3) limited Penn to 58 yards on 32 carries and 171 yards passing and intercepted Ryan Glover twice.? Ryan Fulse had 38 carries for 218 yards and three touchdowns and T. J. Linta passed for 167 yards and three scores, propelling Wagner (3-7, 2-3 Northeast Conference) to a 52-36 victory at Bryant (6-4, 2-4)."
"To the Editor:Re “Trump Says He’d Be Wary of Letting His Son Play” (SportsMonday, Feb. 4):President Trump complained to The New York Times’s publisher at their meeting last Thursday that just once he would like to see a positive piece about him. And a couple of days later one actually appeared.The president talked about his fears about his son Barron playing tackle football. He sounded like any other concerned parent. No bluster, no posturing, just serious concern. To the extent that it matters, it was nice to see.Robert RothNew York"
"In the N.F.L., where there is so much downtime between games, coaches will spend hundreds of hours scheming and plotting new ways to fool the opposition.The excessive calculation can lead to what seems like innovation. But usually, it is not new at all.Take, for example, this season’s trendiest offbeat play: the halfback or wide receiver option pass.Perhaps last week you saw a highlight of wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. fielding a lateral on what looked like a running play — until Beckham stopped to throw a classic, perfectly executed option pass across the field for a touchdown to running back Saquon Barkley. (The option on the play is that Beckham could have chosen to run the football instead; the deception is that he appeared to be doing just that.)In the opening weeks of this season, four other wide receivers or halfbacks have also thrown option passes. In last season’s Super Bowl, an option pass was the pivotal moment of the Philadelphia Eagles’ upset victory. The ever-staid N.F.L. isn’t much for fads, but clearly the option pass is a play in vogue. Since 2016 it has been tried roughly 35 times.It’s a heady time for a play that is at least 108 years old. In fact, the newly popular option pass is probably the oldest trick play in football still regularly in use.Which raises the question: If the option pass has been around since before World War I, how does such an old ruse still work?The answer may go back to all the preparation before games.“With all the scouting and film study, modern N.F.L. defensive players are schooled in an opponent’s tendencies and taught to read keys on the field so they can react faster and quicker,” said Ernie Accorsi, the former general manager of three N.F.L. teams. “But that’s the reason they can be tricked.“The minute they see a certain key for a run play, they pursue it aggressively, but that leaves somebody open.”Or, as Joe Horrigan, the executive director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and a noted football historian, said: “It remains successful because it is not just a pass play, but a pass play with the threat of a run.”In that way, the essence of the pass option is subterfuge, which was the point when the play was first designed around 1910.While there is much debate about which players or teams deserve credit for popularizing the forward pass, the conversation about the genesis of the option pass is more muted. Historians believe it evolved slowly, with short shuttle passes after the forward pass was legalized early in the 20th century.In Kansas, however, a group of coaches and players from the 1910 College of Emporia football team laid claim to the first methodical, regular use of the halfback option under the direction of Coach Homer Woodson Hargiss. In recorded interviews from nearly 50 years ago, the 1910 Emporia team insisted that halfback Wayne B. Granger routinely faked a run and then threw the football. Granger’s nickname was “Twisty.”How can you not believe any story with a protagonist named Twisty?What is known unequivocally is that the option pass — almost always executed off an end-around play or a sweep to the left or right — was commonplace beginning in the 1920s. It was usually a slow developing play with the running back waiting for overeager linebackers and defensive backs to surge forward.As offenses evolved and players were removed from the backfield and positioned as wide receivers, passing became more prominent. That brought about a dormant period for the option pass because the quarterback — the best passer on the team — had several immediate options for getting the ball downfield.In time, defenses adjusted, and by the 1950s, the option pass had a revival. It helped that versatile multiskilled players were there to execute the old trick play. Frank Gifford, the Giants’ running back at the time, threw for 823 yards and 14 touchdowns in his career.Dan Reeves, the future coach and a former college quarterback, threw a 50-yard halfback option touchdown pass in the famed 1967 Ice Bowl N.F.L. championship between Dallas and Green Bay.It became a feature of title games and resulted in the game-clinching touchdown in the Cowboys 1978 Super Bowl victory.Ten years later, John Elway became the first quarterback to catch a pass in a Super Bowl game on an option play.Beside the Super Bowl, and throughout the regular season, players of all stripes successfully executed option passes: wide receivers, backup quarterbacks, tight ends and defensive players. (Passes thrown off fake punts or fake field goals are not considered option passes in the classic sense.)And, of course, there was last season’s Super Bowl when Philadelphia tight end Trey Burton was told that his first three options were to run the football, but he opted for a fourth choice and threw to quarterback Nick Foles for a touchdown.To call that play took some nerve from Eagles Coach Doug Pederson. Indeed, for parts of the 1990s and the early part of this century, the option pass again had periods of latency, something blamed on conservative coaches who didn’t want to risk the second-guessing if the trick play failed.“It does take guts to call it,” Accorsi said, “because if it doesn’t work, it can be a disaster. When guys who aren’t quarterbacks get a chance to throw the ball, they’ll throw it into coverage. They’ll throw it just to throw it.”Throughout football history, intercepted option passes have been common. So has a worse outcome, which is an intercepted option pass returned for a touchdown.But the doughty option pass has a way of resurfacing, just as it has recently. There appear to be two primary reasons for that, and one is that it is a psychological tool for demoralizing an opponent.Walt Michaels, the Jets coach from 1977 to 1982, would use the play only when his team had a lead late in a game.“You use a play like that to finish off an opponent, to destroy their confidence,” Michaels said.There is another reason the play persists.“Every single player who is not a quarterback always wants the chance to throw the football in a game someway or somehow,” Eli Manning said a few seasons ago. “It’s as simple as that. And I mean, I understand; it is fun.”"
"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Robert K. Kraft's New England Patriots are a very good football team, having won six Super Bowl championships the past 19 years. They are 33-5 against the A.F.C. East division rival Buffalo Bills during that span.In a cruel twist of fate, Robert Kraft's other team that plays at Gillette Stadium, the New England Revolution, might as well be the Buffalo Bills of Major League Soccer. There was a run of dominance — four M.L.S. Cup Finals appearances in six years — without a championship, and a mostly fallow period now going on a decade. The team is below .500 (125-148-89) since 2008, the year after it went to its third straight M.L.S. Cup Finals.Kraft has bigger concerns at the moment than the Revolution. He is facing two misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. (Kraft denies illegal activity.) Kraft most likely won't face jail time, but the charges could result in a fine or a suspension or both from the National Football League, where he has become one of the most powerful owners, and from Major League Soccer, where he also enjoys a long, close relationship with the commissioner.If his attention turns back to his soccer team, he is likely to find a house in the middle of a major overhaul.â€œOne of our strategies last year was to instill a new culture at the club,â€ said Brad Friedel, the former United States national team goalkeeper hired to turn around the team last year. He said a tear-down had been necessary. â€œWe felt that there needed to be a completely different work ethic.â€Friedel spoke before the Revolution's home opener last weekend, a 2-0 loss to the Columbus Crew. He praised his team's recent signings, but he didn't hesitate to criticize the team he took over. â€œWe needed leaders,â€ he said. â€œWe didn't have a lot of leaders last year.â€There is no Tom Brady here.The Revolution began play in 1996, as one of Major League Soccer's 10 original teams. Kraft, alongside Lamar Hunt and Philip Anschutz, recruited Don Garber from the N.F.L. to be the league's commissioner, and that tight group helped keep M.L.S. afloat in the early 2000s, when it was on the verge of collapse.But while Kraft has been able to master the N.F.L., the soccer revolution in America has mostly passed him by.The Revolution are one of three M.L.S. teams that still play in cavernous football stadiums. The others, Atlanta United and the Seattle Sounders, justify it by drawing the largest average attendance figures in the league, but only 13,808 fans showed up for the Revolution's home opener last weekend. The Revolution will draw better when there isn't snow on the ground, of course, but last year's average attendance ranked 16th in the league.The team has been trying to build a soccer-specific stadium somewhere in the Boston area since 2006. In the 13 years since, sites have been proposed, millions have been spent on architectural renderings, and plots of land have almost been purchased, all to eventually collapse for one reason or another. A new multimillion-dollar training center will open this season, but that too will be in Foxborough, even as the Boston stadium search goes on.â€œIt's about getting into a stadium that will transform soccer in our region,â€ the team president, Brian Bilello, said. â€œWith that in mind, we have been patient, probably to a fault, to try and get the right project done.â€In Garber's mind, most of the Revolution's problems would be fixed by a new stadium. â€œMy view is their economic model is challenging in Gillette,â€ he said. â€œIt has not been able to tap into the young, millennial sports fan in the Boston metropolitan area because it is further away.â€The couple hundred die-hard Revolution fans tailgating in the parking lot before the home opener weren't so sure. The stadium search has gone on for so long that they rarely get their hopes up anymore. A number of them said that it feels as if the Revolution are a distant priority for the Krafts.Bilello and Garber deny that is the case. Still, the N.F.L. is a $15 billion-a-year league, and a social, financial and cultural presence far bigger than M.L.S. Kraft sits on some of the N.F.L.'s most powerful committees. His son, Jonathan Kraft, holds those roles on M.L.S. committees and seems to handle most of the team's day-to-day business.Last year, the Krafts spent $20 million to buy their third team, the Boston Uprising, an e-sports team that competes in the Overwatch League. The sardonic joke among some Revolution supporters is that now they're not even the neglected second child, but something even worse: the ignored middle child.The team declined to make either Robert or Jonathan Kraft available for this article.Over the years, the Revolution have dabbled in signing higher-priced players, but none has proved a particularly large draw or game-changing addition on the field. The team now wants to give young homegrown players, like Isaac Angking, Nicolas Firmino and Justin Rennicks, a real pathway to first team minutes and success.This off-season, the team also acquired Carles Gil, a Spanish midfielder Friedel hopes will jump-start the attack, along with other players who figure to make an impact, like Edgar Castillo and Juan Fernando Caicedo. Bilello said that the team's spending on players had been ramping up and that the Krafts were giving the team all the money it needed to compete; both Bilello and Friedel promised that another designated player — the league's highest salary classification — would arrive in either May or July, once contractual issues could be worked out. They would not reveal the player's identity.The team is also building a new $35 million training center adjacent to Gillette Stadium that will house both the first team and the academy. The center will feature a number of grass and artificial turf training pitches — the team's current training pitch is covered in snow, so it has been practicing at Gillette Stadium — and the state-of-the-art facilities that, team officials hope, will help persuade new players to join.Soccer is soccer, though, and building a winning team is mostly the same the world over. The thing that makes M.L.S. unique, according to Friedel, who spent nearly two decades playing in England and other top European leagues, is that it is constantly evolving.â€œWhether there is a new rule, a new stadium, a new training ground, other new designated players, a new club, a new franchise, a new second division, a new third division,â€ he said, ticking off the list of possibilities, â€œall these things happened in this country because the league is growing.â€The last four M.L.S. Cups have been won by teams that weren't original league members, and the last few years have witnessed a steady expansion of the league. When M.L.S. fans think of the most exciting teams now, they are often thinking of bright new teams with bright new stadiums with bright young stars, clubs like Atlanta United and Los Angeles F.C.â€œAt times it is easier to be new, and it is easier to be a new and improved, than it is to be a legacy business,â€ Garber said.In New England, they know how true this is."
"Arms raised high. Crowds united in song. Riot police armed with batons. These images could have been taken at political rallies or protests. But they weren't. They were from soccer matches in northwestern Algeria.The sport is so popular in the North African nation and the region, that it's been given the Marxist treatment: â€œWe call it the opium of the people,â€ Fethi Sahraoui said. Since 2015, Mr. Sahraoui has photographed roughly 30 games in his hometown, Mascara, and in neighboring Relizane. The result is â€œStadiumphilia.â€During soccer season — which runs from late August until the end of May — young men storm stadiums to watch local teams face off in biweekly matches. Unlike those fans, Mr. Sahraoui isn't concerned with the athletes. He turns his lens toward the surrounding commotion, the fervent faces in the stands.The atmosphere is electric, to say the least. Algerian law prohibits anyone under 18 to enter the stadiums without a guardian, Mr. Sahraoui said. But that doesn't stop young boys from trying to jump over fences to see the action.On the surface, the takeaway is that Algerians are soccer fanatics. But Mr. Sahraoui sees beyond the entertainment. He says the stadiums have become platforms for young men to find a sense of brotherhood and to escape the pressures of daily life. After spending years among those crowds, he adds, he can't help but link the energy of those games to current protests.In February, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced that he would run for a fifth term. Algerians had been living under his rule for 20 years, and they had had enough. Thousands of demonstrators have been taking to the streets demanding his resignation, citing problems like corruption and stifling unemployment.Life is particularly rough for Algerian youth. According to the International Monetary Fund, the unemployment rate among Algerians between the ages of 15 and 24 is more than 28 percent. And a third of youth are either unemployed or not in school. â€œWe need to admit that what's happening in Algeria, this popular movement or popular uprising, it's orchestrated mainly by youth,â€ Mr. Sahraoui said.He feels that before the protests, young Algerians took out their frustrations in the soccer stadiums. Their songs and chants were highly political and socially conscious: They would imagine better lives or call for local politicians to step down. Some would sing tribute songs to friends who had perished trying to cross the Mediterranean, Mr. Sahroui said.Politics has long been intertwined with the sport. In one image, a boy peers out from behind a poster of Zougari Taher, a man who died during the Algerian war for independence from France in the 1950s and '60s. Locals herald Mr. Taher as a martyr, and the stadium in Relizane is named after him.With the recent protests, Algerians have turned to the streets. â€œI'm happy for them because it's a larger space and a lot of people are hearing them and paying attention to them,â€ Mr. Sahraoui said. The streets also allows for more unity. Women have openly taken part in the demonstrations, while soccer has always been a â€œmanlyâ€ sport in the country, Mr. Sahraoui said. He wanted this essay to focus on young fans, and most if not all of those happened to be boys.Mr. Sahraoui couldn't exactly see himself in those youngsters. Growing up, his family thought the games were dangerous and prohibited him from going. â€œWorking on this project, it was like a delayed exploration of this universe,â€ he said. â€œI went there as a photographer, but there was the young child who was inside me.â€Fun fact: These images — and all of his personal projects — were taken with smartphones. But he says if no one notices, â€œit's a good sign.â€ He feels at ease with the device. Plus, carrying a larger digital camera would have drawn the curiosity of riot police, while a phone helped him blend in with the crowds.â€œI think that a photographer will remain a photographer,â€ he said. â€œEven with an iPhone.â€Follow @nytimesphoto and @_SaraAridi on Twitter.

"Twenty-eight members of the world champion United States women's soccer team significantly escalated their long-running fight with the country's soccer federation over pay equity and working conditions, filing a gender discrimination lawsuit on Friday.The suit, in United States District Court in Los Angeles, comes only three months before the team will begin defense of its Women's World Cup title at this summer's tournament in France. In their filing and a statement released by the team, the 28 players described â€œinstitutionalized gender discriminationâ€ that they say has existed for years.The discrimination, the athletes said, affects not only their paychecks but also where they play and how often, how they train, the medical treatment and coaching they receive, and even how they travel to matches.The players involved — stars like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd and their teammates — include some of the most accomplished and best-known female athletes in the world, members of a team that has been a leading force in women's sports for more than a generation.The players' continuing battle with U.S. Soccer, which is not only their employer, but also the federation that governs the sport in America, has thrust them to the forefront of a broader fight for equality in women's sports. In recent years, players, teams and even athletes in other sports — American hockey gold medalists, Canadian soccer pros, W.N.B.A. players — have reached out to the United States players and their union for guidance in their efforts to win similar gains in pay and working conditions.â€œI think to be on this team is to understand these issues,â€ Rapinoe said in a telephone interview. â€œAnd I think we've always — dating back to forever — been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place.â€Friday's legal action is the latest flash point in a yearslong fight for pay equity and equal treatment by the national team, which has long chafed — first privately, but increasingly publicly — about the compensation, support and working conditions it receives while representing U.S. Soccer. The women's players argue that they are required to play more games than the men's team, that they win more of them, and yet still receive less pay from the federation.[Sign up for the Sports newsletter.] For decades, U.S. Soccer has been a world leader in its support for women's soccer; its investment of time and resources has made the United States, which is a three-time world champion and a four-time Olympic gold medalist, the dominant power in the women's game. But throughout that period, generations of women's national team players have complained that the federation's financial support and logistical infrastructure have lagged behind that of the more high-profile men's team.Those grievances have never been far from the surface; an earlier generation of top women's players angry about their pay boycotted a tournament in Australia in January 2000, only months after a World Cup victory had made them the toast of American sports. The dispute between the team and the federation burst into the open more recently as an increasingly emboldened and activist women's team took on U.S. Soccer and FIFA, soccer's global governing body, over everything from artificial turf fields to World Cup bonus payments to refereeing standards.The players' prominence and willingness to leverage their profiles and enormous social media followings in support of their cause have paid dividends: FIFA doubled the prize money pool for this summer's Women's World Cup only after the United States team's complaints drew attention to how far it lagged behind the pool for the much richer men's event, and the team has not played a match on artificial turf, a surface many players disdain, since 2017. The United States women flew on a chartered flight — once an unthinkable luxury for the squad — between matches as recently as last week, and U.S. Soccer has eliminated other inequities on topics as disparate as meal money and hotel accommodations.The respect they have won has spread, too: Spain's national team rose up to demand the ouster of its coach after the last World Cup, and several prominent members of Brazil's squad quit their team to protest the ouster of a popular female coach in favor of a man. Players from Argentina and Colombia have gone public about mistreatment and meager pay, and Norway's players demanded — and won — equal pay with their men's counterparts. That, too, several United States players said, was part of their motivation to press ahead with their suit only months before they turn their focus to retaining their world championship.â€œWe very much believe it is our responsibility,â€ Rapinoe said, â€œnot only for our team and for future U.S. players, but for players around the world — and frankly women all around the world — to feel like they have an ally in standing up for themselves, and fighting for what they believe in, and fighting for what they deserve and for what they feel like they have earned.â€U.S. Soccer did not respond to a request for comment.Direct comparisons between the compensation of the men's and women's teams can be complicated. Each team has its own collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer, and among the major differences is pay structure: The men receive higher game bonuses when they play for the United States, but are paid only when they make the team, while the women receive guaranteed salaries supplemented by smaller match bonuses.One of the biggest differences in compensation is the multimillion-dollar bonuses the teams receive for participating in the World Cup, but those bonuses — a pool of $400 million for 32 men's teams versus $30 million for 24 women's teams — are determined by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, not U.S. Soccer.The bulk of the suit mirrors many of the issues raised in a wage discrimination complaint filed by five United States players with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016. Frustrated by a lack of progress on that complaint after nearly three years of inaction, the players received permission from the federal agency in February to sue instead. (One of the players on the original complaint, the former goalkeeper Hope Solo, filed her own gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer in August.)The suit offers a new forum but also new hurdles. The players, represented by Jeffrey Kessler, who has been involved in labor fights in nearly every major American sport, will have to prove not only that their team and the men's squad do the same work, but also overcome questions about the differences in their pay structures and their negotiated collective bargaining agreements. And the C.B.A. has already left them without one bit of leverage: The players cannot strike to press their case at least until it expires at the end of 2021.But to experts in gender discrimination and Title IX cases, the argument they are making is familiar.â€œThese are the same kinds of arguments and claims that we still see at every level of education for women and girls, from K through 12 to college,â€ said Neena Chaudhry, the general counsel of the National Women's Law Center in Washington. â€œIt's unfortunately a sad continuation of the way that women and girls in sports are treated in the U.S.â€"
"Soccer officials from one of FIFA's largest confederations have gathered this week in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, to elect a president. The balloting will take place at the end of a long day of speeches, motions and reports, but at least the setting — the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel — promises to be comfortable.Before the vote is held, the incumbent, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, will have the opportunity to make a speech outlining his qualifications. His opponent will not.That is because, as usual, there is no opponent.For the third time in less than a year — the fourth will come in June — one of soccer's largest and most powerful governing bodies will rubber-stamp the election of its leader in a one-candidate election. South America's governing body, Conmebol, went first last May, when it granted President Alejandro DomÃ­nguez an unopposed second term, and Europe's governing body, UEFA, followed suit in February by re-electing Aleksandr Ceferin. In June, FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, will retain his post in yet another walkover.â€œThere has always seemed to be a great deal of fear around challenging the incumbent and because of the potential for retribution built into the system,â€ said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. For that reason, she said, regular uncontested elections are â€œnot all that surprising.â€Wrage previously advised FIFA on corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization's most vocal critics.In Asia, Sheikh Salman had been challenged — briefly — by opponents from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, two countries at the center of a broad political dispute that has spilled into soccer in a variety of ways, but both dropped out of the race late last month after a series of behind-the-scenes meetings in the Gulf.Sheikh Salman's presidency has been marred by controversy since he was elected in 2013 to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam, a wealthy Qatari businessman who was banned for life in the wake of a corruption investigation. His connections to Bahrain's royal family, for example, have led to Sheikh Salman's recusing himself from a role in some of the Asian Football Confederation's most sensitive decisions, such as in the highly publicized case of Hakeem al-Araibi, a soccer player who fled to Australia after claiming he had been tortured by the Bahraini government during pro-democracy demonstrations there in 2011.Salman also did not take part in discussions over how to deal with the pirating of the A.F.C.'s Qatari broadcast partner's programing by an illegal operation based in Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is among the countries backing the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar.The re-election of incumbents, routinely without opposition, is common in soccer, where the power structures remain closely held despite a sprawling investigation in 2015 by the United States Department of Justice that exposed corruption schemes at the highest levels of the sport dating back decades.The American case largely avoided implicating officials in Asia, but by then regional soccer leaders had already faced a reckoning after a series of internal investigations into the conduct of Sheikh Salman's predecessor, Bin Hammam, and his leadership team. Those reports, including one by the former F.B.I. chief Louis Freeh, exposed a series of unexplained payments made to soccer officials throughout Asia and Africa.The reports, three in total, which have been reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of payments made on behalf of Bin Hammam by the A.F.C.'s longtime media partner, World Sports Group, and specifically its regional head, the Lebanese businessman Pierre Kakhia. The payments included legal fees for an official from Tahiti who was facing an ethics ban, and money to a consulting firm hired to promote Bin Hammam's bid for the FIFA presidency.Despite his links to Bin Hammam, Kakhia remains a trusted consultant to the A.F.C., currently responsible for handling millions of dollars worth of sponsorship contracts, even though he last worked for W.S.G.'s parent company in 2016.The A.F.C. declined to say why it had retained the services of Kakhia.As well as Sheikh Salman's re-election, delegates at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur will pick candidates for coveted places on global soccer's ruling body, the FIFA Council. That contest, featuring eight candidates vying for six places, has proved to be contentious.South Korean officials have complained to the A.F.C. over perceived double standards in ethics rules after their country was barred from inviting soccer officials to Seoul to attend an exhibition game last month, a prohibition that was not extended to Qatar, which wrote to officials inviting them on an all-expenses paid trip to attend two matches there. Both South Korea and Qatar have candidates in the election, as does the Philippines, whose candidate, the South Koreans contend, has been using a private jet owned by a Qatari official to travel across the region during his campaign.â€œWe urgently request you to review this matter in relation to any violation against the relevant regulations in force,â€ the Korean soccer federation president, Chong Mong-gyu, wrote in a letter to the A.F.C. The A.F.C., which confirmed it had received the South Koreans' complaint, declined to say why it had not issued the same warning to Qatar.Sheikh Salman's challengers dropped out of the presidential race after a series of decisions by the A.F.C., including the surprising move to break an exclusive television contract with the A.F.C.'s broadcast partner, the Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports, in order to allow games to be broadcast in Saudi Arabia, where games have been broadcast illegally for almost two years. BeIN said it planned to sue the A.F.C. over the decision.Until that decision, Saudi Arabia had been supporting an Emirati candidate, Mohammad Khalfan al-Rumaithi. Rumaithi withdrew his candidacy shortly after the television agreement was struck. The third candidate, Saoud al-Mohannadi of Qatar, soon followed suit."
"U.S. Soccer has invited South America's 10 soccer federations to bring their national teams to the United States in 2020 for a new intercontinental championship that would run concurrently with that summer's European Championship.The offer, a package that includes almost $200 million in guarantees to the invited teams and their governing bodies, was made Tuesday in a letter from U.S. Soccer's president, Carlos Cordeiro, to his counterparts at the 10 South American federations. For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents, but with no agreement in sight, U.S. Soccer, eager to fill a gap in the global soccer calendar and bearing an enticing nine-figure offer, is now proposing to establish its own.In the letter, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation — and both confederations — millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Cordeiro has invited the South Americans to a meeting to discuss the proposal next week in Miami.The proposed 16-team tournament would resemble, in structure though most likely not in name, the 2016 Copa AmÃ©rica Centenario. That tournament, a relocated version of the South American championship — expanded to celebrate the event's 100th anniversary — brought the 10 members of the South American confederation, Conmebol, to the United States for a month to face off not only against one another, but also a half-dozen opponents from Concacaf, the regional confederation made up of North and Central America and the Caribbean.That tournament was considered a sporting and — perhaps more important — a financial success, and was won by Chile, which beat Argentina in a penalty-kick shootout in the final in East Rutherford, N.J. The new event would take place in June and July next year.The proposed 2020 tournament would again include all 10 South American teams, plus six from Concacaf, and would most likely feature a group stage and then a knockout round to determine a champion. U.S. Soccer's role in the offer, and Concacaf's consent, would be critical to making the event happen, since both would have to approve any plans to hold such an event in the United States.Concacaf released a statement Tuesday night acknowledging receipt of Cordeiro's overture and expressing support for its broad strokes: â€œWe view this opportunity positively as it is not intended to replace or substitute any future editions of the Concacaf Gold Cup and it complements our vision to continue providing opportunities for our Member Associations to play competitive football at the highest level.â€In his letter, a draft of which was seen by The New York Times, Cordeiro took pains to emphasize that the new event would be a singular tournament, and not meant to replace existing events like the Copa AmÃ©rica or the Gold Cup, which would continue separately. Conmebol, which will contest this year's Copa in June and July in Brazil, said last year that it was planning to shift the Copa AmÃ©rica to a quadrennial schedule starting in 2020, to coincide with UEFA's European Championship. Concacaf holds its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, in odd-numbered years; this year's Gold Cup matches will be played in the United States, Costa Rica and at least one Caribbean nation.For next summer, though, Cordeiro is proposing a larger, intercontinental event in the United States. The event could fill a gap in the global soccer calendar — at the moment, the Euros are the only major championship scheduled for that summer — but despite the millions being offered, it is unclear how South American and Conmebol officials will react to a tournament that would conflict with their Copa AmÃ©rica plans.The Copa AmÃ©rica has included guest teams for years; Mexico and the United States have participated in it several times, and this year it will include Japan and Qatar.For the United States, though, the event could have several positives. FIFA is expected to choose the dozen or so host cities for the 2026 World Cup in the next two years, so the tournament could be a chance for the 17 finalists to make their case for inclusion. It also would offer meaningful competition for the United States men's national team as it heads into qualifying for the 2022 World Cup; that process began later than hoped because the search for the team's head coach, Gregg Berhalter, was delayed, first by the World Cup bid and then by the search for a general manager to run the national team program. Hired in December, Berhalter has coached only two friendlies to date as he prepares for this summer's Gold Cup.If the proposed tournament with Conmebol does not come to fruition, U.S. Soccer could still press ahead with a new event, possibly a scaled-down tournament involving teams from other continents."
"A computer hacker who for years published the innermost secrets of the global soccer industry — revelations that have shed light on questionable behavior by some of the sport's most influential figures and top clubs — was told on Tuesday that he would be extradited to Portugal, where he faces charges linked to his activities.Lawyers for the man, Rui Pinto, 30, immediately said they planned to appeal the decision made by a court in Budapest, where he was arrested in January. They argued that his whistle-blowing activities far outweighed any crimes he might have committed in securing the documents. In Portugal, Mr. Pinto is charged with an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.The leaks first emerged in 2015, on a website called Football Leaks, before Mr. Pinto, a year later, joined with the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and a group of other European news media organizations to slowly disseminate related news articles. They painted an unflattering picture of an industry troubled by questionable efforts to avoid millions of dollars in tax, flagrant rule breaking by some top clubs and an alleged sexual assault by one of soccer's biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo.While the Portuguese authorities want to put Mr. Pinto on trial, their counterparts in France and Belgium have said they want to work with him, to gain access to the enormous database he has compiled as they continue investigations into figures in the soccer world. The ruling in Hungary makes that difficult, said Francisco Teixeira da Mota, who is part of a legal team that includes William Bourdon, a French lawyer who previously represented the national security whistle-blower Edward Snowden.Hungarian officials seized all of Mr. Pinto's computer equipment, including hard drives containing the soccer industry data, when he was arrested. The Hungarian judge ruled that all of that can be sent to Portuguese authorities. That will chill efforts by the authorities in other countries, and make it impossible for further revelations to emerge, Mr. Teixeira da Mota said.â€œWe think if he's extradited to Portugal it would put a stop to all that,â€ he said, adding that the Portuguese case is limited to Mr. Pinto's conduct in relation to the investment fund Doyen Sports and the soccer team Sporting Clube de Portugal.It is not clear how much of the data Der Spiegel possesses and how much of it the news weekly is prepared to share with investigators.While being hailed as a whistle-blower by many, Mr. Pinto's past conduct has raised questions about his motives. He reached an out-of-court settlement with the Caledonian Bank after being accused of hacking into its systems and transferring thousands of dollars from one of its client accounts. Mr. Pinto denies he stole any of the money, but citing a nondisclosure agreement, he has declined to provide further details.As he awaits his fate, news media groups with access to his data continue to publish new revelations. As recently as last weekend, details emerged of an apparent effort by the Premier League giant Manchester City to circumvent fiscal rules set by European soccer's governing body by disguising sponsorship payments, and another alleged scheme by the same club to run an off-the-books player recruitment fund.Mr. Pinto's appeal is likely to take up to two weeks to be settled, his lawyer said."
"MYSLENICE, Poland — The dark, uneven soil at Wisla Krakow's training facility in this village 40 minutes south of Poland's second largest city was frozen solid last month as a few hundred supporters trudged through the snow to greet Jakub Blaszczykowski.Blaszczykowski, a 33-year-old midfielder, has played in some of soccer's biggest matches, including the 2013 Champions League final as a member of Borussia Dortmund, two European championships, and a World Cup with Poland's national team.But on this January afternoon, Blaszczykowski was a long way from those moments. Instead, he was about to play his first exhibition game since rejoining Wisla Krakow, one of Poland's most decorated teams. Wisla is the club Blaszczykowski made his name with, and the team he had promised to someday return to when he signed with Dortmund in 2007.He was not returning to ease into retirement, though, or for a final payday. In fact, the opposite was true: Blaszczykowski, known as Kuba, had come home in an unusual deal in which he agreed to take virtually no money to play and to join with two Polish investors to lend the club 1.33 million zloty (about $350,000) to cover his new teammates' unpaid wages.The Wisla Krakow he rejoined, he knew, was in dire straits, its proud history besmirched after a series of disastrous events involving a hooligan takeover, missing money and a mysterious foreign investor who offered himself as a savior, collected the club's ownership certificates and then — without producing even a single zloty — disappeared.Wisla Krakow's problems were years in the making. But they started to accelerate in 2016, when the team's longtime owner, Boguslaw Cupial, decided to sell the club.Cupial had been one of Poland's postcommunist success stories, earning millions through his cable company, Tele-Fonika. In 1997, he invested some of his fortune in Wisla, transforming the club into an eight-time league champion under his stewardship. But Cupial took a big hit in the 2008 global financial crisis and in 2016 sold the money-losing club to a local buyer.That buyer promptly flipped the club to TS Wisla, a supporter-friendly umbrella organization that already controlled Wisla Krakow's other sports teams. The businessman, it turned out, had no money, said Michal Trela, a reporter for Przeglad Sportowy, a Polish sports daily. â€œAfter one month,â€ Trela said, â€œthe supporters bought the club back for 1 zlotyâ€ — around 25 cents.In an age of superrich foreign owners in soccer, a sale that actually gave fans a say in the running of their club should have been refreshing. But at Wisla, the purchase appeared to hand control to a group of soccer hooligans called the Sharks.â€œAlmost every club in Poland has a problem with hooligans,â€ said Szymon Jadczak, an investigative reporter for the Polish television network TVN. â€œBut in Wisla, the hooligans were the club.â€The Sharks have a loud, intimidating presence at Wisla's stadium and in 2015 a group of them made headlines when they were photographed giving the Nazi salute while in Rome to watch Roma play Lazio. Now they were calling the shots at Wisla Krakow, under the leadership of Pawel Michalski, who had served more than six years in prison for throwing a knife from the stands at an Italian player during a UEFA Cup match. Through TS Wisla, Michalski was able to ensure that two people with close connections to the Sharks were put in charge of the club, and contracts for everything from cleaning the stadium to printing the match-day programs were signed with friends and associates at what were viewed as inflated rates. The club, Jadczak said, became a â€œsort of cash machineâ€ for people connected to the Sharks' leadership.When questions were raised, the Wisla president installed after the Sharks' takeover, Marzena Sarapata, held a news conference to dismiss the claims that the hooligan group effectively controlled the club. But a few months later, an arrest warrant was issued for Michalski, whom the police charged with heading a criminal group and with having involvement in the drug trade. Shortly afterward, Poland's Central Bureau of Investigation undertook a series of raids in which they arrested dozens of hooligans. Michalski left Poland.Jadczak's televised investigation about the takeover and mismanagement at Wisla — broadcast by TVN in September — was the last straw; the club's top officials resigned, and the city of Krakow persuaded Poland's soccer authorities to send any money owed to the club to the city instead, to cover unpaid rent at a city-owned stadium. Michalski was eventually arrested in Italy; he will stand trial later this year.  Sarapata did not respond to phone calls or messages from The New York Times but did give an interview to a website owned by the same Polish betting company that sponsors Wisla and denied all the allegations. Meanwhile, the video clips of hooligans being arrested and of searches at TS Wisla's headquarters made finding a new investor for the club difficult. And the unpaid players merely fell into line with the other debtors. Wisla needed a savior.In December, it thought it had found one. A French-Cambodian businessman named Vanna Ly, who claimed to have extensive investments in soccer clubs around the world, announced he would be purchasing 60 percent of Wisla Krakow. The rest would be owned by Noble Capital Partners, a British investment firm represented by a Swedish businessman, Mats Hartling. The deal was reported to be for 12 million zloty ($3.2 million).Ly arrived in Krakow to watch a game and began to meet people connected to the club. Invariably, they knew little about him beyond his name and his promise to invest. â€œI met Vanna Ly, he's real, he exists,â€ said Rafal Wislocki, one of the few team officials untainted by association with the Sharks. â€œHe has ID. I saw this ID. French ID.â€Ly, Wislocki and other club officials took in a 1-0 league defeat against Lech Poznan on Dec. 21. It was the last game before the winter break, and Wisla Krakow, despite the crisis, sat a creditable eighth in the 16-team Polish league. Ly made clear that he was not impressed with the standard of play, Wislocki said, but at least sounded as if he knew how to run a soccer club. â€œHe knew the answer when I asked difficult questions,â€ Wislocki said.The purchase contract was signed, though in hindsight, team officials said, even then something was awry: Despite claiming to control millions of dollars, Ly arrived in Krakow on a budget airline, and when he was spotted leaving Krakow's city hall after a meeting, he attempted to hide from reporters under a black umbrella. The bulk of the money to pay off the team's debts was due a few days later, but it never arrived. At first, Ly told Wisla officials that his phone had been stolen, preventing him from sending the cash. Later, they were told that Ly had had a heart attack on his private jet as it flew to New York.Ly was never heard from again. Despite repeated attempts by The Times to contact him by email and by phone, he did not respond. After initially hanging up the phone, Hartling emailed a one-line reply: â€œLy is a criminal who will be pursued accordingly.â€Asked about Ly in a text message, Adam Pietrowski, the player agent who had brought Hartling to Wisla and was briefly club president, replied with an emoji: a sad face with a Pinocchio nose.By then, Wisla Krakow had bigger problems than a missing investor. European soccer's midseason transfer window would open Jan. 1, and with the club's license to play suspended because of its grim financial state, and with its unpaid players likely to depart, Wisla had only a few weeks to stabilize its affairs.Wislocki, who had successfully run the team's youth academy, was appointed club president. Blaszczykowski, out of favor at his German club, Wolfsburg, suggested he would consider a return. In January, he and the two investors he had joined forces with delivered a vital infusion of cash to cover the team's back wages. Still, he delayed his full commitment to play until the restoration of Wisla's license was assured.In the end, Wisla sold eight members of its squad in January, but the payment from Blaszczykowski, as well as the promise of playing alongside a player revered in Poland, stemmed the hemorrhaging of talent.â€œKuba gives us belief that we can make this club great again,â€ Wislocki said.A few days after his first exhibition match, Blaszczykowski trotted onto the freezing field in Myslenice again as a large crowd sung his name. If anything, it was even colder. Again Wisla lost, again by 3-2, and again a crowd gathered by the entrance to the training ground in hopes of taking a photograph with Kuba.As the second half of that game began, word arrived that Wisla's most urgent crisis was over: The league had restored the team's license, allowing it to sell tickets to its remaining games. Wislocki announced that the club was selling 5 percent of its shares to fans; in less than 24 hours, the offer raised 4 million zloty (a little more than $1 million). Blaszczykowski eventually signed his contract, although league rules prevented him from playing for free. Instead, he'll donate his 500 zloty minimum wage ($130) to a local children's home. And he finally made his league debut in a 2-0 defeat against Gornik Zabrze last week. A new owner still needs to be found — without one, said Trela, the journalist, â€œit will be impossible to get a new license for next seasonâ€ — but Wisla is breathing a little easier.Its coach, the former Poland international Maciej Stolarczyk, who took the job last summer, has known only chaos and financial crisis at the club. He, too, had met Ly, whose bold promises, he said, had been magnified by the Polish news media. â€œThey said we will be another Manchester City in Poland!â€ Stolarczyk said, laughing. â€œBut I want to say the team didn't believe everything they were told.â€His only concern now is the second half of the season. Having one of Poland's best players is a bonus, he said, but he is acutely aware of the weight that Blaszczykowski carries. â€œEveryone will be looking at him, everyone will be talking about him, and also all the rivals will try to stop him,â€ Stolarczyk said. â€œSo our task is to try and protect him.â€Long after the final whistle of his first game back, Blaszczykowski did not seem to need protection. He was standing stone-faced as he signed every shirt that was handed to him and posed for every selfie. He was why parents had brought their children out in the biting cold to press against the fence, to squint into the low winter sun. He was why Wisla fans had hope again.â€œWe love Kuba,â€ one man said. â€œKuba is our hero.â€"
"KABUL, Afghanistan — He was their nightmare, the young, female Afghan soccer players say: a menacing 57-year-old with two wives who locked the door to his back office with a biometric keypad that only he could open.Many of those young soccer players, members of the women's national team, lined up to accuse the man, the president of Afghan soccer, Keramuddin Keram, of sexually assaulting them in a bed he kept in that room, and elsewhere, charges they made both in public statements and to Afghan prosecutors. Women who rebuffed his advances were labeled lesbians and expelled from the team, according to eight former players who said that had happened to them.Three months later, however, the investigation into sexual abuse in Afghan soccer is stalled, amid fears it will never proceed. It has yet to result in any criminal charges.One of Mr. Keram's accusers, the soccer player Khalida Popal, said he had actively pursued women who testified against him in Afghanistan, warning them to withdraw the charges. And witnesses like her who live in exile have not been interviewed in person by Afghan investigators, as required by law, because so far the investigators have not been able to get visas.Mr. Keram remains the president of the Afghanistan Football Federation, which is in charge of men's and women's soccer, the country's most popular sport, although he is suspended by order of the attorney general. And FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, has just extended Mr. Keram's ban from participating in national and international soccer for three more months, as its own investigation, nearly a year old, grinds on.Neither FIFA nor Mr. Keram responded to requests for comment.Despite public support from President Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan investigation has run into a powerful lobby made up of supporters of Mr. Keram from Panjshir, a politically dominant province in northern Afghanistan. Once a local warlord and later governor of the province, Mr. Keram remains well connected with the Jamiat-i-Islami party, the major political force in the north.Prosecutors have the power to arrest Mr. Keram but have not done so, though they have blocked him from leaving the country. â€œIf the investigative committee thinks they need to arrest him, they will do so,â€ said Jamshid Rasooli, the attorney general's spokesman.Mr. Rasooli confirmed a report by ToloNews, an Afghan television news program, that two of the attorney general's investigators had not yet obtained visas to interview witnesses in Europe, which has led to speculation that the visas were denied for fear that the investigators would claim asylum themselves. He said they had been waiting for the visas for more than a month.Ms. Popal, 31, reached by telephone in Denmark, said she had heard from at least three soccer players in the past two months who withdrew their charges against Mr. Keram after they received direct, personal threats from him.Two of the women answered calls from someone they knew, who then handed the phone to Mr. Keram. In the third case, the woman was walking to soccer practice in Kabul near the football federation offices when she was forced into a car with blacked-out windows, finding Mr. Keram inside, Ms. Popal was told.â€œHe told them, â€˜I know you have been to the attorney general's office and given testimony against us,' â€ Ms. Popal said. â€œ â€˜Go and take back the testimony. You know I am a powerful person. Nobody will put me in jail. I will win this case. It'll take some time, but then what will happen to you? Think about your future and what will happen to you and your family.' â€Ms. Popal said the three women, whom she declined to identify for their safety, had gone into hiding and were no longer willing to testify against Mr. Keram.Mr. Keram did not respond to repeated efforts to contact him for comment. A spokesman for the Afghan federation, Shafi Shadab, who had earlier spoken on behalf of Mr. Keram, said Saturday that the attorney general had ordered him to have no further contact with the soccer chief. The federation's Facebook page has posted a statement denying all of the charges.Ms. Popal was one of the founders of women's soccer in Afghanistan and remained active with the team after fleeing to Denmark, where she claimed asylum in 2011. She accused Mr. Keram of the rape and sexual assault of other players and claimed to have evidence that she had reported those claims to the federation early last year with no response.â€œThe president of A.F.F. and some trainers are raping and sexually harassing female players,â€ she said in a December interview. She earlier made similar claims in an interview with The Guardian.In addition to Mr. Keram, four other members of the federation were suspended and banned from travel. The ban on one of them, the federation's deputy president, Yosuf Kargar, was lifted in January after the attorney general's office said it had found no evidence against him.Mr. Keram appealed his suspension by FIFA but was denied.Earlier, the sponsor of the Afghan national women's team, the Danish sportswear manufacturer Hummel, withdrew its financial support over what it called â€œstrong allegations of severe mental, physical, sexual and equal rights abuse of the female players by male A.F.F. officials.â€Last month, Kelly Lindsey, the American coach of the Afghan women's team, urged FIFA to step in and take more concrete action. It could, for instance, ban the Afghan teams from competition.â€œI think FIFA really needs to stand up here. They are the governing body of football and if they allow this to happen in their culture, then it's easy for it to be pushed under the rug,â€ she said in an interview with Reuters.FIFA has defended its actions, noting that it suspended Mr. Keram and is investigating the allegations. It added that it had â€œzero toleranceâ€ for sexual abuse. Last week, FIFA said the head of its investigation had requested that Mr. Keram's ban be extended for 90 days, and that the organization had agreed.â€œDuring this time, Mr. Karim will continue to be banned from all football-related activities at both national and international level,â€ it said, using an alternative transliteration of Mr. Keram's name.Human Rights Watch weighed in last month, urging both FIFA and the Afghan authorities to move more decisively on their investigations. â€œFIFA, which said it began investigating these allegations last April, should share information with Afghan investigators and maintain a ban on accused officials,â€ the rights group said.Mr. Rasooli said the Afghan attorney general was determined to fully pursue the case against Mr. Keram and the others accused. They have not been arrested, he said, because under Afghan law that would limit the time the authorities had to conduct their investigation.â€œThis is a complicated case,â€ he said. â€œWe have interviewed 30 witnesses inside Afghanistan and that part of the case is almost completed.â€He added that the authorities still hoped to obtain European visas for investigators.Ms. Popal said she was still hopeful that the investigation of Mr. Keram and his colleagues would succeed.â€œI really respect and trust the committee in the attorney general's office working on this case,â€ she said. â€œAt the same time, I don't know how powerful they are once the case is out of their hands. And he is a powerful guy, with so much influence inside the government.â€"
"When the United States beat the reigning champion, Japan, in the 2015 Women's World Cup final, it felt like a high-water moment. Over 25 million people watched — the largest ever for a broadcast of American soccer, male or female. I worried that women's soccer would then retreat back into the shadows, with no one following it until the next World Cup or Olympic cycle. But since that milestone, the women's soccer world has been, to my great surprise, full of good news.Looking ahead to the 2019 Women's World Cup in France, I expect it to get even better. In this era of outright hope in the women's game, the United States is still the beacon. But it's not just here: After decades of neglect, federations and clubs have poured money into the women's game. More and more women from around the world are able to make a living playing the sport. Some professional teams in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico are even offering college scholarships to their players — following the United States' precedent of preparing players for futures beyond soccer.In Europe, most of the storied clubs have women's sides (Real Madrid is a notable exception). In 2018, the English pro league went fully professional, offering top-notch facilities and competitive salaries and attracting star players. New pro leagues in Mexico and Colombia are proving that machismo-rich cultures can embrace the women's game. In BogotÃ¡, Colombia, in 2017, over 33,000 fans packed into the Estadio Nemesio Camacho for the first-ever women's league final. A 2018 final in Mexico City drew a world-record crowd for a women's club match — 51,211 fans packing the Azteca.In Cameroon, too, the public is hungry to watch: During the 2016 Africa Cup of Nations in YaoundÃ©, 40,000 filled the stadium —Â five hours before kickoff. During Euro 2017, the Netherlands sold out every game, and a whopping 83 percent of the Dutch population, 4.1 million, watched the final on television.With that international growth, the United States faces stiffer competition, but its players have gained opportunities to play for Lyon (Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe), Paris (Tobin Heath, Allie Long) and Manchester City (Carli Lloyd). When you factor in the crop of young, talented newcomers — including 24-year-old Lindsey Horan and 20-year-old Mallory Pugh — you may be looking at the most promising team in history for the 2019 World Cup.The 1991 team, the first American World Cup champion, was composed of trailblazers who fought for opportunity and protectively mentored members of this new generation, who are doing the same for the next, fighting for equality and a sustainable pro league — a fight that is rippling around the world.

"South America's top soccer official on Thursday rejected an invitation to take part in a proposed intercontinental tournament hosted and financed by U.S. Soccer in the summer of 2020, saying the continent's governing body preferred to maintain the primacy of its own continental championship, the Copa AmÃ©rica.U.S. Soccer President Carlos Cordeiro had made the offer for a combined tournament featuring South America's 10 teams and six from the region comprising North and Central America and the Caribbean in a letter earlier this week. U.S. Soccer's offer would have been worth tens of millions of dollars for the South American teams, their regional rivals who took part, and the two confederations governing soccer in the Americas.But in a letter to Cordeiro dated Wednesday, first reported by the Brazilian news outlet Globo, the president of the South American federation, Alejandro Dominguez, categorically rejected the invitation to a proposed Continental Cup in 2020. Dominguez's letter cited a lack of FIFA approval for the new event, but also a preference to prioritize the Copa AmÃ©rica, which is the oldest international soccer championship in the world.Last year, officials from the South American confederation, Conmebol, announced plans to shift the Copa AmÃ©rica to a quadrennial schedule starting in the summer of 2020.But U.S. Soccer, frustrated by a lack of progress in talks for a combined international tournament, invited South America's 10 soccer federations to take part in a 16-team championship held in the United States. The framework of the new tournament would have been similar to the 2016 Copa AmÃ©rica Centenario, a one-time tournament celebrating the event's 100th anniversary that was a financial and sporting success. U.S. Soccer sweetened its offer for 2020 with nearly $200 million in guarantees to the visiting teams and their confederations.In his letter inviting the South Americans, Cordeiro said U.S. Soccer was offering to underwrite the new event and guarantee each nation — and both confederations — millions of dollars in appearance fees, subsidized travel and bonuses for each point earned. The champions could take home a prize of more than $11 million. Conmebol and its northern neighbor, Concacaf, would receive $50 million each to go along. Cordeiro invited Conmebol officials to a meeting in Miami next week to discuss the proposal.U.S. Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Conmebol's decision to decline the offer.For the past year, soccer officials across the Americas have held discussions about creating a quadrennial tournament involving national teams from both continents. The Copa AmÃ©rica will take place as planned this summer in Brazil, with Japan and Qatar filling the two guest spots often reserved for teams from Concacaf. Concacaf will hold its own regional championship, the Gold Cup, at the same time.If the offer to Conmebol is not revived, U.S. Soccer is expected to press ahead with plans for a scaled-down tournament featuring national teams from other continents, potentially including Africa and Asia."
"Two years ago — in a move that delighted some in women's sports and shocked others — Olivia Moultrie announced that she had accepted a scholarship offer to play college soccer at the University of North Carolina. She was 11 years old.On Monday, Moultrie, the youngest girls' soccer player to publicly accept an academic scholarship offer, became the youngest girls' soccer player to then officially forgo her college athletic eligibility. Now 13, Moultrie announced that she had signed, in short order, a representation deal with the Wasserman Media Group, a sports agency, and a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike. In taking those two actions, Moultrie formally began her professional career.Moultrie's agent, Spencer Wadsworth, declined to disclose the terms of the Nike deal, except to say that it was worth more financially than a four-year scholarship at a top university, which is generally valued at about $300,000.â€œIt's just a shift in women's sports,â€ Wadsworth said. â€œYou see it more and more now where women's soccer is catching up to the men's side, and there's more opportunities for them.â€Moultrie has already drawn worldwide attention for her prodigious technical skills and her family's nontraditional approach to her nascent career. She has long played with older girls on the United States youth national team and with boys' clubs near her family's home in Canyon Country, Calif.Last year, Moultrie made multiple trips to Europe to meet and train with some of the continent's biggest clubs: Olympique Lyon and Paris St.-Germain in France, and Bayern Munich in Germany. And with the help of her father, K.C., she has maintained an active presence on social media, often posting highlight clips to more than 87,000 followers on Instagram.â€œI feel for literally almost every kid in girls' soccer, you should go to college; there's not a million dollars at the end of the rainbow,â€ K.C. Moultrie said in an interview with The New York Times last year. â€œI think if you're truly, truly elite, if your goal is to be a world-class player and a pro and, in Olivia's case, to be the best player in the world, there's no way it's better to play college than it is to play full time.â€Moultrie's next step is unclear. A move to Europe is most likely impossible for several years; FIFA rules, with certain exceptions, generally prevent youth prospects from signing with foreign clubs before they turn 18.A far more likely prospect would involve Moultrie's latching on as a developmental player with a team in the top United States league, the N.W.S.L. But that path has its own obstacles; before she could ever sign a professional contract, the league would essentially have to create new allocation rules to deal with her unique situation. In addition, a player currently must be 18 to play in the N.W.S.L.Moultrie has been on her unconventional path for years. She began intense, soccer-specific training when she was 7 years old, started home schooling as a fifth grader to free her schedule for more soccer, and eventually became the first girl to play for a boys' club team in the United States Development Academy system. She was 10 when she began attending college showcase camps, and at 11 she accepted a full scholarship offer from North Carolina.That she gave up the scholarship was not a huge surprise. For one thing, sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas had long had Moultrie in their sights. Last year, when she was still an amateur, Nike featured her in a local promotional campaign for one of the company's soccer cleats. On Sunday night, Moultrie appeared briefly near the end of a Nike commercial that aired during the Academy Awards.Nike, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its deal with Moultrie.Anson Dorrance, the longtime coach at North Carolina who had offered Moultrie a scholarship, said in an interview on Monday that he was pleased Moultrie had signed a deal for what he presumed was a significant amount of money, noting that the vast majority of women's soccer players still struggle to make a steady living as professionals. He said Moultrie's deal was a good development for the women's game.â€œWe knew what was in the water, and we have no issue with this,â€ Dorrance said about Moultrie's decision. â€œWe lost a great player to the professional ranks, and we totally support that, if the financial incentives are good.â€Though it has long been common for boys in the United States to skip college to pursue soccer careers, it is a move that has so far made sense for only a few girls.Just two members of the current United States women's national team, for instance, have walked away from college scholarship offers for professional opportunities. Mallory Pugh was 19 when she did it two years ago, joining the N.W.S.L.'s Washington Spirit before ever suiting up for U.C.L.A. In 2012, Lindsey Horan joined P.S.G. at 18 after having accepted a scholarship offer from North Carolina.But in doing so at 13, Moultrie has become an extreme outlier, even if — in all likelihood — it will be years before she has an opportunity to prove herself before a wide audience.Dorrance said her skills were more than sufficient for her to thrive. The one, big question that remained, he said, was how much more she would mature physically.â€œThat's the risk for any young kid whose ambition is to play at a high level,â€ Dorrance said, â€œor for a shoe company that is signing them young or a professional team that is signing them young.â€"

"KABUL — Allegations of sexual abuse of members of Afghanistan's national women's soccer team by sport officials have resulted in missed paychecks after sponsors pulled out, taunts and entreaties from parents to their daughters to quit playing. FIFA, global soccer's governing body, suspended the head of the Afghan Football Federation and several other officials in December. The Afghan federation has called the allegations against its president, Keramuddin Keram, ""groundless"".Afghan President Ashraf Ghani ordered an investigation after Britain's Guardian newspaper reported in November that senior figures linked to the women's team alleged that some players had been molested by federation officials.The treatment of the female players, even those who have not alleged sexual abuse, illustrate the Afghan culture's complicated approach to handling matters involving both women's sexuality and participation in sports.The national women's team was only formed in 2010. Some conservative-minded Afghans oppose women playing sports. Since the investigation was launched, so many players have stopped training that friendly matches scheduled for outside Afghanistan have been canceled, said the federation's Arzu Rahimi, who is responsible for women's soccer.PUBLIC SHAME, FAMILY PRESSUREAt least seven players have made allegations, although they have not been identified publicly. Five of the players who have made allegations did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.Parents, alarmed by public treatment of female players since the allegations, have urged their daughters to give up soccer.""My mother told me not to go to federation, university or even outside the house anymore,"" said Samea Hamasi, 25, a member of the team for seven years.Players who were in Uzbekistan for a series of matches in November faced taunts from Afghans living there.Players sobbed in the dressing room in Tashkent's stadium and had to be coaxed to take the field, many with tears in their eyes.""After what people have put us through, I say to myself that I wish I were not an Afghan at all,"" Samea said.Fereshta Shaikh Miri, 23, has played for the team for five years.""Before I was proud to be a member of the team, but now it is a stigma to be part of the team and I feel ashamed to mention that I am part of the national soccer team,"" she said.The men's soccer team, receiving government support, has begun spring training, but training has been canceled for the women.Dubai-based Alokozay Group, a company with a ubiquitous presence in Kabul selling soft drinks, tissues and tea, pulled its $850,000 annual contribution to the federation in February, following Danish sports brand Hummel, which canceled its sponsorship in late November.Afghanistan's soccer federation is now solely funded by FIFA, the Asian Football Confederation and the government.""All the achievements of the national soccer team would be impossible without (Alokozay's) support,"" said Yusuf Kargar, supervisor of Afghanistan's soccer federation. ""After all the rumors about the abuses of female players, they are looked at negatively by the public."" Alokozay canceled its sponsorship because of an administrative vacuum resulting from the allegations, the company said in a February statement. In a statement in November, Hummel cut ties with the Afghan Football Federation citing its ""unacceptable behavior"".The investigation of the players' allegations is at an early stage, said Mohammad Sadeq Farahi, head of the crime investigation department for the Office of the Attorney General.It now wants to send investigators to France, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany and Greece to interview players living abroad, and is seeking visas, he said.Separately, FIFA is conducting its own investigation. The organization said in March Keram would remain suspended for three months. (Reporting by Orooj Hakimy; Writing by Rod Nickel; Editing by Rob Birsel)"
"ROSSINGTON, England — Over the years, Sheila Edmunds has done pretty much everything for the Doncaster Belles. Half a century ago, she was among the group of friends who founded the club. For 25 years, she wore the team's No. 8 jersey and, for a while, its captain's armband.When she retired, she filled in wherever required: welfare officer, first-aid practitioner, physiotherapist. Now her official title is president and general manager. If that sounds like an executive role, an honorary sinecure, it is not.An hour or so before a game at the windswept stadium that the Belles now call home, Edmunds can be found in the simple wooden cabin that passes for a ticket office. At her back is an electric heater, on futile full blast to stave off the bitter cold. She welcomes fans handing over the Â£5 entrance fee warmly, as if each one is an old friend.In quiet moments, she might help out at the trestle table that serves as the Belles' merchandising arm. After kickoff, she keeps one eye on the game as she totals up the day's takings; it is easier this way, she says. She is the one, after all, who will have to enter it all into the club's accounts later.There is more money in women's soccer in England than there has ever been. Last summer, the country's highest tier — the Women's Super League (W.S.L.) — became, for the first time, fully professional, with a broadcasting arrangement with the BBC. England's biggest clubs, including Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, all have invested heavily in their women's teams in recent years, spending not just on homegrown players but for high-profile imports, too. Manchester United, even, has finally joined the fray: It launched its women's team, in the second-tier Championship, last year, and immediately set about recruiting an all-star roster.The effect has been seismic, not just in terms of results — Manchester City reached the Champions League semifinals the last two seasons and England's national team finished third in the 2015 Women's World Cup — but in terms of interest, too. More than 45,000 people attended last season's women's F.A. Cup final, and two million more watched it live on television.Little or none of that growth, though, has found its way to Doncaster; or, more accurately, Rossington, a small village on the outskirts of the town, where Doncaster Rovers Belles play their home games in the third tier of English women's soccer.Crowds rarely number much more than a hundred here. There are no television cameras. Last summer, the club's biggest sponsor walked away; its income now does not stretch far beyond the cash Edmunds sifts through in front of that electric heater.And yet this is the team that has, arguably, done more for women's soccer in England than any other, a club that was synonymous with the sport for decades. In the 1980s and early 1990s, long before the professional clubs showed any interest in women's soccer, the Belles were its pre-eminent force.Between 1983 and 1994, the Belles reached 11 of 12 women's F.A. Cup finals, and won the trophy six times. The team won the first ever women's national league title, in 1992, and regained the crown in 1994; it would finish as runners-up seven times in the following years.Back then, its players formed the backbone of the English national team. â€œAt one point, we had seven or eight players in the squad,â€ said Gillian Coultard, who spent 21 years playing for the Belles in the team's heyday, and picked up 119 appearances for England. For a long time, she was one of five players to have made a century of appearances for her country. The others were Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Peter Shilton and Billy Wright. â€œIt was a good quiz question,â€ she said.Doncaster, of course, was proud of the Belles: A small, tight-knit town on the edge of the South Yorkshire coalfield, it is not a place that attracts much national attention, or frequently enjoys much sporting success. The Belles changed that. â€œWe won so much,â€ Coultard said. â€œThe cup finals were on television. We felt like we represented Doncaster, and South Yorkshire. We kept the town at the pinnacle.â€Edmunds remembers the club being asked to send representatives to have â€œafternoon tea with the Queen and Prince Philipâ€ when they visited Doncaster. The players were guests of honor at the town's Mansion House, the ornate Georgian home of the local authorities, on several occasions.â€œWe never had any sexist stuff,â€ she said. â€œSouth Yorkshire people aren't like that. It's the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do. They get behind you. There was a real pride at what we achieved.â€There was broader, cultural recognition, too. The writer Pete Davies spent a year with the team in the early 1990s; his subsequent book, â€œI Lost My Heart to the Belles,â€ coupled with the club's success, made the name famous. The playwright Kay Mellor used the book as source material for â€œPlaying the Field,â€ a BBC drama that ran for five seasons in the 1990s.To many, at a time when women's soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention, the Belles were the sport's most prominent face. â€œThey were the epitome of women's football,â€ said Mike Blackham. Like most of the people who go to watch the Belles now, Blackham and his wife, Jane, have a personal connection to the club: A friend plays for the first team.That is testament to how the club's horizons have retracted in recent years. As the fortunes of women's soccer have risen, those of the Belles have ebbed. â€œThe women's game has changed,â€ Edmunds said. â€œIt is more financially driven. We have been left behind a little bit.â€In 2013, when the Football Association, the sport's governing body in Britain, expanded the Women's Super League to two divisions, Doncaster Belles were demoted to the second tier and Manchester City's women's team — far younger but, crucially, aligned with a Premier League behemoth — were promoted in their stead. Vic Akers, then the manager of Arsenal Ladies, described the decision as â€œmorally scandalous.â€Doncaster was promoted back to the top flight in 2015, but lasted only a season before being relegated again. It won the second division last year, its first trophy since 1994, but did not take up its place in the top tier: The F.A. had changed the licensing criteria, and the Belles — lacking a headline sponsor and a major men's team to bankroll the club — could not meet the new requirements. â€œFinancially, we could not do it,â€ Edmunds said.All but two members of the championship-winning side departed, many for Manchester United's new women's team. Neil Redfearn, the manager, left for Liverpool. The Belles decided against using the Keepmoat Stadium, the neat, modern venue that is home to Doncaster Rovers, the men's team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance, and set up instead in Rossington, where the two stands are little more than a few steps covered by a roof. Smaller surroundings, Edmunds said, would not be as â€œdauntingâ€ for the young players that now comprised the team.In Doncaster, the Belles' fame endures, and so does the affection and esteem in which they are held. Edmunds, for example, is well-known enough in the town that, a few years ago, when she was awarded an honor in London for her contribution to sport, the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade: It referred to her by only her first name.Blackham, who coaches a local junior team, finds that while young boys dream of Premier League stardom, the girls tend to have a different ambition. â€œThey don't talk about playing for Manchester City or Chelsea or Arsenal,â€ he said. â€œThey want to play for the Belles.â€There is some regret at the club's diminished status — â€œthe demise of it is very sad, because it was so unique,â€ said Coultard — but there is no resentment of the game's authorities, no lingering anger at the Football Association for failing to curate the most famous women's team of all. â€œThat era has gone,â€ Edmunds said. â€œWe do not want people to forget that history, because so many people put so much into it, but we do not dwell on it.â€Instead, she said, she takes satisfaction in seeing all of the players who came through the club's ranks who have gone on to play professionally, to play in Europe, to play for their country.The golden age of the Belles may have come and gone, Edmunds said, but the club still has a role to play. â€œYou look at those players and think we must be doing something right,â€ she said. â€œWe still contribute. There is real pride in that.â€Those Belles may be wearing different jerseys now, playing for different clubs, but they still bear the stamp of the club she helped to create. They all add a little more sheen to the legacy. In Edmunds's eyes, they are still Belles. â€œThat's what we have always said,â€ she said, turning back to the day's takings. â€œOnce a Belle, always a Belle.â€"
"LONDON — The wreckage of the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer striker Emiliano Sala and his pilot, David Ibbotson, has been found on the seabed in the English Channel, a shipwreck hunter said on Sunday, days after parts of the aircraft's seat cushions were discovered on a French beach.The plane was found using an underwater drone that recorded video of the wreckage, including the body of one of the victims, the British government said on Monday. The video showed the aircraft registration number on the fuselage, confirming that it was the missing plane.â€œThe families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by police,â€ David Mearns, the shipwreck hunter whose team had been searching for the Piper Malibu plane, said on Twitter.The single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft  disappeared over the English Channel after departing Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Jan. 21, headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales.Mr. Mearns, a maritime scientist, told the British broadcaster Sky News on Sunday evening that the vessel â€œwas located earlier this morning by my crew onboard the Morven,â€ referring to the search ship FPV Morven. Mr. Mearns's company, Blue Water Recoveries, had been collaborating with the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or A.A.I.B., scanning the sea floor using sonar.A ship commissioned by the air accidents agency, the Geo Ocean III, launched a remotely operated vehicle, or R.O.V., to view the discovery at close range, the agency said in a statement on Monday.â€œBased on analysis of R.O.V. video footage, the A.A.I.B. investigators on board the vessel concluded that the object is wreckage from the missing Piper Malibu aircraft, registration N264DB,â€ it said. The underwater drone â€œcarried out a further search of the area overnight, but did not identify any additional pieces of wreckage.â€â€œTragically, in video footage from the R.O.V., one occupant is visible amidst the wreckage,â€ the agency added, but it did not specify whether the body was Mr. Sala's or Mr. Ibbotson's. â€œThe A.A.I.B. is now considering the next steps, in consultation with the families of the pilot and passenger, and the police.â€Mr. Sala's family had commissioned a private search after the authorities ended their search of the Channel's surface and small islands on Jan. 24. David Barker, the harbormaster of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement at the time, â€œThe chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote.â€Mr. Sala, 28, a prolific goal scorer for Nantes in the French league, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City and was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day.The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart.After the authorities ended their search, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala's sister, pleaded with the authorities not to call it off.â€œPlease, please, please don't stop the search,â€ Ms. Sala said at a news conference in Cardiff, fighting back tears.She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.A Facebook message to Mr. Sala's sister seeking comment was not immediately answered on Sunday night.People from all over the world — including soccer stars like Kylian MbappÃ©, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year — chipped in to help the family's search.Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Jan. 25 that by Sunday evening had raised more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000.Geo Ocean III departed Ostend, a coastal city in Belgium, on Sunday morning to begin a three-day underwater search, the A.A.I.B. tweeted. The search area was to cover about four square miles, according to the BBC.On Sunday evening, after the wreckage was discovered in the English Channel, Mr. Mearns told Sky News: â€œThis is about the best result we could've hoped for the families, but tonight they've heard devastating news.â€"
"BANGKOK — The global sports market is worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Now, this powerful industry is coming together to promote an unlikely cause: human rights.Since late November, a Bahrain-born soccer player for a minor team in Australia has been held in detention in Thailand. The player, Hakeem al-Araibi, 24, is not a famous athlete. He has no lucrative sponsors.But he has spoken out against one of the most powerful men in international soccer, who is also a member of the ruling family of Bahrain. His testimony of torture at the hands of Bahrain's repressive government earned him refugee status in Australia, which determined that he faced credible threats of persecution should he return to the Gulf state.Still, over the past week, Mr. Araibi has collected an impressive list of supporters in the world of international sports.Fatma Samoura, the secretary general of FIFA, the international body governing global soccer, has called for Thailand to return him to Australia â€œas a matter of urgency.â€ So has Thomas Bach, the head of the International Olympic Committee, who raised the issue with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.On Tuesday, Praful Patel, a vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, issued a statement asking Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand to ensure Mr. Araibi's return to his adopted home.The head of the Asian Football Confederation is Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini official whom Mr. Araibi accused of not stopping the persecution of athletes in his charge. Sheikh Salman also serves as a FIFA vice president.Such a collection of statements of support is rare, said Mary Harvey, the chief executive of the Center for Sports and Human Rights, which assembles governments, sports bodies, corporate sponsors and nongovernmental groups to ensure the role of human rights in sports.â€œHakeem is a historic test case, because it's the first time that we've seen these big, powerful sports bodies all come together publicly to address the fate of a single person,â€ said Ms. Harvey, who was a member of the United States national soccer team and a FIFA executive.Sports has been buffeted by growing concerns about the hidden human costs of mega-events, like the Olympics and the World Cup, that have been used to bring international glory to authoritarian governments. Hundreds of foreign laborers, mainly from South Asia, have died in the building of stadiums and other infrastructure for the 2022 men's soccer World Cup in Qatar, according to the International Trade Union Confederation.Although the Qatari government has pledged to improve the rights of its migrant work force, some construction workers and foreign athletes continue to work in what is essentially indentured servitude, human-rights monitors say.Last year's hosting of the men's soccer World Cup by Russia was marred by racism and homophobia controversies. Both bids for the World Cup by Qatar and Russia were tarnished by a series of corruption scandals that cleared out a significant portion of FIFA's leadership ranks. With corporate sponsors nervous about a backlash from sports fans, FIFA unveiled a series of reforms aimed at bettering its human rights.In January, Brendan Schwab, the executive director of the World Players Association, which represents 85,000 professional athletes worldwide, wrote an urgent legal request on the â€œsevere violation of the human rightsâ€ of Mr. Araibi, which was submitted to FIFA. The brief was also signed by unions representing professional soccer players.â€œHakeem's case is about a football player, it's about a human-rights defender, it's about a refugee and it's about global sport's ability to uphold its stated commitment to human rights,â€ Mr. Schwab said.Although FIFA now has binding human-rights policies, they are largely untested. Even though FIFA's human rights advisory board was formed two years ago, the request on Mr. Araibi's behalf was the first time such a formal submission had been made.When Mr. Araibi traveled to Bangkok on Nov. 27 with his wife for a belated honeymoon, the Thai authorities were waiting for him at the airport.Initially, Thai officials said Mr. Araibi had been detained based on an Interpol request alerting the immigration authorities to fugitives of justice. But Interpol quickly lifted that request because such alerts, called red notices, are not supposed to apply to refugees.Nevertheless, Bahrain has formally asked Thailand for Mr. Araibi's extradition so he can return to face a 10-year prison sentence for a conviction in absentia on charges that he burned a police station, among other convictions.Last week, the extradition request was passed on to the Thai attorney general's office, said Busadee Santipitaks, a spokeswoman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meaning that Mr. Araibi's fate could be decided in a matter of days.Mr. Araibi was playing in a televised football match when the police station he was supposed to have attacked was burned. Bahrain has racked up thousands of questionable convictions related to its crushing of its Arab Spring movement in 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis joined street protests, human rights groups say.Thailand, which has not signed an international convention on refugees, has a history of extraditing human rights defenders to countries they have fled, like China or Bahrain, where they are likely to face imprisonment or torture.In early January, however, a Saudi teenager who had flown to Bangkok and feared death from her family, avoided deportation and was eventually allowed to travel on to Canada, where she was granted asylum. Her release followed an outcry on social media.In 2016, Sheikh Salman, who has refused to answer questions about Mr. Araibi's detention in Thailand, ran for the FIFA presidency. But his front-runner status diminished in part because of questions raised about Bahrain's record of imprisoning protesters, including members of the national soccer team.Instead, Gianni Infantino, who was born in Switzerland, won the top job. Both Mr. Infantino and Sheikh Salman are up for re-election to their respective posts this year.Running for the first time for a vice-presidential post in the Asian Football Confederation is Somyot Poompanmoung, the leader of the Football Association of Thailand. A former national police chief, Mr. Somyot faced a scandal last year after it emerged that he had received large loans from a fugitive brothel owner implicated in human trafficking.Thailand has mulled the possibility of jointly bidding for the World Cup in 2034 with another Southeast Asian nation. After the tainted bids by Russia and Qatar, updated FIFA guidelines now require that human rights be considered as a factor in deciding which country wins the right to host the prestigious tournament.â€œSports, like the Olympics and football, should and can bring social change,â€ said Craig Foster, a former captain of the Australian national soccer team who has lobbied on Mr. Araibi's behalf.â€œWe've got to hold governments accountable and say, â€˜If you want the great honor of hosting these major sports tournaments, then you have to accept global human rights standards,'â€ he said."
"CLAIREFONTAINE, France — Women's soccer has been developing rapidly in France but Frenchwomen do not believe they are in a position to ask for the same financial treatment as the men even though their American counterparts have filed an equal pay lawsuit.France, fourth in the FIFA women's world rankings, are among the favorites for this year's World Cup on home soil, but they are still trailing the U.S., the three-times world champions.""The guys have a huge exposure, they have results and a lot of people following them,"" 21-year-old midfielder Grace Geyoro told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of a friendly game against Japan.While the U.S. men's team failed to qualify for last year's World Cup, Didier Deschamps's French side emerged triumphant in Russia.""The bonuses will depend on our performances, on how things are going to pan out, on what kind of exposure we will get,"" added Geyoro.""We would like to get a little bit more. Maybe not as much as the men but a bit more would be great,"" striker Valerie Gauvin, who plays at Montpellier, told Reuters.The 22-year-old is hoping that the World Cup will boost the sport's visibility and consequently, its financial attractiveness.""I hope it won't take too long even if it has been going in the right direction and maybe after this summer things will evolve faster and the World Cup will draw more media and more sponsors.""Deschamps's men earned 300,000 euros ($336,000) each after beating Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final and French media reported that the women will receive a 15,000-euro bonus each if they lift the trophy in Lyon on July 7.Paris St Germain player Geyoro explained that women's soccer has a higher profile in the U.S. due to the team's success at multiple World Cups.""In the U.S., women's soccer is growing faster,"" she said. ""Now it is up to us to increase our exposure."" One of the ways to increase exposure to the media and the fans would be for women to play in the same stadiums as the men.Last week, 39,000 supporters turned up for a women's game between Juventus and Fiorentina at Turin's Allianz Stadium.""We have played some games at the Parc des Princes for big events and obviously playing in bigger stadiums would attract more people,"" said Geyoro.Women playing in one of France's top clubs (Lyon, PSG, Marseille, Montpellier) earn an average 4,000 euros a month, according to French federation figures - a far cry from the reported 3 million euros a month earned by PSG's Neymar.However, it is not all doom and gloom for the women. ""There are less barriers with the fans, a lot of people can come and see us. There are more and more young girls coming to the stadium to see the training sessions for the games,"" said Gauvin, who managed to complete a marketing and communications course while playing football.($1 = 0.8925 euros) (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"LYON, France — The best women's soccer player in the world was strolling down a cobbled street on Monday afternoon when a man in an apron emerged from a seafood restaurant and peered incredulously down the sidewalk.â€œIs it really her?â€ he said, tilting his head.The player, Ada Hegerberg, who had just enjoyed a coffee at a quiet local cafe, laughed and waved to the smiling stranger. Within moments, the man was holding his cellphone in front of their faces.â€œThe women's Ballon d'Or, the first one, is with who?â€ he said, gesturing animatedly toward the phone as he recorded a video. â€œShe's with me!â€Life has changed a bit for Hegerberg in the past week. To be sure, it has been some time since Hegerberg, 23, established herself as one of the brightest talents in the women's game, a striker capable of producing cartoonish goal-scoring figures — 120 goals through 95 games since 2014 — for the premier women's club team in Europe, France's Olympique Lyonnais.But as Hegerberg has found over the past week, winning the Ballon d'Or — a prize recognizing the world's best player, presented at a star-studded, televised ceremony in Paris that until this year had been awarded to men — can catapult things to a dizzying new level.More people recognize you. More people listen to what you say. More people know your story. More people get things wrong.â€œI knew this would be the biggest thing that happened in my life,â€ Hegerberg said about the award, â€œbut I didn't know how huge it was until I went on that stage.â€It was what happened on that stage that thrust Hegerberg, through no fault of her own, into the broader public consciousness: a flip remark from the French D.J. serving as one of the ceremony's hosts (â€œDo you know how to twerk?â€); the immediate storm of viral outrage the question generated; the subsequent wave of support from friends and strangers; the dozens of requests for interviews. â€œThis whole week,â€ Hegerberg said Monday, â€œhas been crazy.â€She joked that this new existence, all of a week old, felt like a distant reality from her beginnings in Sunndal, Norway, a town of about 7,000 people. And yet it might have appeared preordained, too, given that Hegerberg's childhood home essentially functioned as an incubator for lethal soccer talent.Her parents, Stein Erik Hegerberg and Gerd Stolsmo, both played and coached soccer for Norwegian clubs. Ada's older sister, Andrine, 25, is a midfielder for Paris St.-Germain. Her older brother, Silas, 32, played the game in his youth.At home, Hegerberg's parents instituted various rules — though they were meant to embolden their children, not constrict them.For example, they never drove their children to soccer practice. â€œThey had to go to training by running or by bike,â€ Stein Erik Hegerberg said. â€œIf it's not important for you, then you won't go.â€The Hegerberg children were encouraged to make their own choices, and to learn from their own mistakes. And, above all, they were told to always, always remain humble. â€œYou can always criticize upward,â€ Stein Erik Hegerberg said, â€œbut never kick downward.â€These values imbued in Ada Hegerberg a clearheaded determination about her beliefs, she said. Now, she wants to use her growing platform to raise awareness, and the level of respect, for the women's game. Among other causes, she has been pushing for more soccer fields to be built in Norway.â€œI know I have a voice, and I want to use that voice as much as I can to bring things forward,â€ she said.Those values, at the same time, will keep her away from the biggest platform of all: the Women's World Cup next summer in France. Last year, Hegerberg quit the Norwegian team after determining the organization was not — in her view — doing enough to support the women's program.She does not enjoy rehashing her specific grievances anymore, but they had built up over time, she said, until the situation became â€œunbearable.â€ Some, including Norway's federation, have described the move as temporary, a â€œbreakâ€ from the team. But Hegerberg insists it is permanent.The notion that she might rejoin the team for the World Cup next summer now that she has been honored as the world's best player, she said, was out of the question.â€œI was quite clear with them about what I thought needed to be better,â€ she said. â€œI gave them the reasons. I wish my national team all the best. I love my country. I wish I could play for them. In this case, I had to move on.â€Hegerberg's decision to quit the national team kept her up for many sleepless nights, she said. But after she made the announcement, she said she felt a huge weight lifted from her shoulders. The new peace of mind, she mused, has played a role in her ascent as a player.Last month, a full two weeks before the Ballon d'Or ceremony, a media officer at Olympique Lyonnais pulled her into a conference room at the team's training center and asked her if she could keep a secret: France Football, the magazine that has presented the award since 1956, had added a women's award this year, the media officer said, and she would be the first recipient.Hegerberg began to cry. Then she ran to her car and called her fiancÃ©, Thomas Rogne, a defender for the Polish club Lech Poznan.â€œWe started laughing, then we started crying, then we started laughing again,â€ she said.Hegerberg glowed as she recounted the ceremony, saying she was most happy that her entire family could share the moment — and the party afterward.â€œIt was a tremendous night,â€ Stein Erik Hegerberg said. â€œIt was joy, harmony, humor, everything.â€Online, though, the ceremony that had introduced Hegerberg to millions had created a much different reaction. In a moment that would inspire cringes around the world, the co-host of the show, Martin Solveig, had greeted Hegerberg by asking if she knew how to twerk. Hegerberg replied with a curt â€œnoâ€ and turned away — a gesture many perceived as one of barely concealed disgust. Solveig's remark, and Hegerberg's response, began to circulate on social media almost immediately, drawing immediate and widespread condemnation from people inside the sport and out who felt it had undercut a big moment and, more important, would never have happened to a men's player.Reflecting on the issue on Monday, Hegerberg said â€œthings blew out of hand.â€â€œIn that situation, I didn't take it bad, at all,â€ Hegerberg said, repeating comments she made to reporters on the night of the ceremony. â€œI just said â€˜no' and turned because obviously I didn't want to twerk in front of millions of people. So it was kind of like an ironic â€˜no,' and I had a laugh because I was there doing the Ballon d'Or, and that was the only thing I thought about.â€She said there were more important issues in women's sports on which to focus her energy, but she said she understood those who felt discomfort about the remark, including the seafood restaurant employee who stopped her on the street on Monday.â€œOn the stage when he said â€˜Let's twerk,' I wanted to say, â€˜Are you serious or what?' â€ the man said on the sidewalk.â€œThe people took it worse than me,â€ Hegerberg told him.More eyes are on Hegerberg these days. And things, she said, are not always as they seem.Upon returning to Lyon after the Ballon d'Or gala, for example, she showed up at practice the next day driving a gleaming S.U.V. The car turned some heads and drew some ribbing from teammates, who thought she had treated herself to a new car to celebrate her award. But the vehicle, she said, was merely a loaner from the club; hers was at the mechanic for repairs.Days later, Hegerberg resumed her season with Lyon. Less than a week after she made headlines while receiving one of world soccer's biggest awards, she was on a bus with her teammates, riding eight hours for a road game against Soyaux.â€œIf you think I was flying the last couple of days,â€ she said, smiling, â€œI went quickly down to earth again.â€"
"MILAN — The setting was a major European soccer stadium, the actors on the grassy stage were playing themselves, and the scene was an Italian league women's match — one like never before.More than 39,000 people packed into the Allianz Stadium to watch Juventus Women beat Fiorentina Women 1-0 on a sunny Sunday afternoon, a record attendance in Italy that far eclipsed the old mark of 14,000.This was no Hollywood movie, though, this was another shining example of the exceptional growth of women's soccer.""You come out in those three seconds, you look around and you say to yourself, 'What is this, a cartoon?' But no, it's reality. And that's the beauty,"" Juventus coach Rita Guarino said. ""We need experience, we need to make it become the norm.""It was the first time the Juventus Women played at the same stadium that the men's team calls home, and tickets were free. But besides the huge crowd, one of the biggest ever for a European club match, it also drew more than 1 million unique viewers on television — nearly double the previous record for a women's soccer game on Sky in Italy.On March 17, there were 60,739 people at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium to watch Barcelona beat host Atletico Madrid 2-0 in a women's game. That followed a match in January which Athletic Bilbao said at the time was a European club record when 48,121 attended a Spanish Cup match against Atletico at San Mames Stadium.The match in Turin was another leap forward in the quest for wider acceptance.""When these numbers become ordinary, then it will be extraordinary,"" Fiorentina coach Antonio Cincotta said. ""This has to be a starting point, not a point of arrival.""The record attendance for any women's match was set at the 1999 World Cup when 90,185 people watched the United States beat China in the final at the Rose Bowl. But interest in women's soccer has seen its share of highs and lows.The Juventus players will surely notice a drop in adrenaline when they play their next home match against Tavagnacco on April 13. That game will be played club's training center in Vinovo, which has a capacity of only 500.That is among the lowest in the league, but no women's Serie A team plays in a stadium with a capacity of more than 4,000.""I don't think it's necessary to play in the same stadiums as the men play,"" AC Milan midfielder Lisa Alborghetti told The Associated Press. ""It's necessary that there are facilities able to hold a big number of fans and that can give the women what they need, simply that.""Besides several recent instances of big attendance numbers, women's soccer has been making gains in other areas as well.In the United States, the women's national team filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation over equal treatment and pay. The players said they were subjected to ""institutionalized gender discrimination"" that includes unequal pay with their counterparts on the men's national team.And in Denmark two years ago, the women's national team signed a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the federation to end a dispute that saw the cancellation of a World Cup qualifier.Video review is also expected to be used at this year's Women's World Cup in France, like it was at the men's tournament last year in Russia, while artificial surfaces for the competition have been ruled out.At the club level, the Women's Super League in England will receive record levels of investment after securing a sponsorship deal reportedly worth more than 10 million pounds ($13.2 million) over the next three seasons.Italy is a different story altogether, however, because women's teams are classified as amateur. But the growth still has been impressive to many.""When we played, if there were 100 fans that was a lot,"" said Barbara Garbagnati, a former player who attended the match in Turin because she is friends with Juventus goalkeeper Laura Giuliani.The fans inside the stadium made a day of it, too, cheering and chanting throughout the match while creating a relaxed atmosphere that made it a perfect opportunity for a family outing.Sofie Pedersen, who scored the lone goal against Fiorentina, was already impressed with the positive attitude in Italy even before the match started.""I think there is a lot of attention around women's football, more than I've (experienced) in other countries,"" said Pedersen, who has previously played for clubs in her home country of Denmark as well as in Sweden and Spain. ""I really feel that people have respect. They respect us and that's really amazing to feel that.""Alborghetti, now 25 years old and a member of Italy's World Cup-bound national team, has seen the ""incredible growth"" of women's soccer in Italy firsthand, starting from the days when she was the only girl on her local team.""Sometimes it was difficult, but above all because of the judgments, the people who would say, 'Oh, that team has a girl.' But then at the end of the match they would say, 'Well done, you have a girl.'""It happened almost all the time, all the matches,"" she said. ""The opposing teams would come on the field and be like, 'You have a girl,' and laugh. But at the end of the match they weren't laughing anymore.""___"
"BERLIN — German soccer federation president Reinhard Grindel resigned Tuesday, bowing to increasing pressure following allegations of undeclared earnings, the receipt of a luxury watch and general discontent with his leadership.Grindel, who promised greater transparency after taking over in April 2016, apologized for accepting a watch worth about 6,000 euros ($6,700) from Ukrainian oligarch Grigoriy Surkis - a UEFA vice president and executive committee member at the time.""Everyone who knows me knows that I am not greedy and have been dealing with compliance issues for years,"" Grindel said in a statement issued by the federation. ""Mr. Surkis had no financial interest in the DFB (German federation). He never asked me for any support, then or after. It was clear at the time that he would not run again for UEFA's ExCo, to which he no longer belongs. There was and is no conflict of interest for me.""The federation said vice presidents Rainer Koch and Reinhard Rauball would take over on an interim basis until September. Koch and Rauball also took over after Grindel's predecessor, Wolfgang Niersbach, stepped down in November 2015 amid the fall out from allegations that Germany's bid to host the World Cup in 2006 was helped by bribery. Niersbach's predecessor, Theo Zwanziger, stepped down in 2012.Grindel's tenure as president was the shortest in the 114 years of the federation.On Monday, the 47-year-old Grindel avoided the red carpet at the opening of the German soccer museum in Dortmund.Grindel was accused by German weekly magazine Der Spiegel last week of failing to declare additional income of 78,000 euros ($87,000) for being chairman of the federation's subsidiary media management company in 2016 and 2017 - on top of his regular salary as president.The federation issued a statement to reject the accusations, saying Grindel took on the position with its subsidiary company only after he became president, and so was not obliged to declare the earnings at the time.But criticism of Grindel was growing louder.""When you're in such a position and such things come to light, you should at last have arguments to put them aside as soon as possible,"" former West Germany midfielder Lothar Matthaeus said. ""The DFB has been on shaky ground before.""Grindel was already under fire for his clumsy attempts to engage with fans while increasing the commercial appeal of German soccer. Monday night games, late kickoff times, and a ban on pyrotechnics have all proved unpopular with fans, who frequently display banners at games criticizing the federation.The former federation treasurer also emerged badly from his ham-fisted attempts to handle the controversy of national team players Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan posing for photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before the 2018 World Cup.Ozil quit after the tournament, saying he was being made a scapegoat for the team's poor performance and a target for racist abuse - and he was particularly scathing of Grindel, who subsequently expressed his regret over his handling of the matter.Grindel was criticized for agreeing to a hasty contract extension with Germany coach Joachim Loew after the tournament, while he recently complained about Loew's decision to drop Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller from the team - before doubling back.Grindel was also embarrassed in 2017 when a scheme to allow China's under-20 team to play against fourth-division clubs was abandoned because of protests from supporters displaying Tibetan flags.Andreas Rettig, managing director of second-division club St. Pauli, said at the opening of the new soccer museum that Grindel would not get a place in its hall of fame.""The DFB's appearance,"" Rettig said, ""has long been in need of improvement.""___"
"STOCKHOLM — With 30,000 tickets sold for their friendly against Germany in Stockholm on Saturday, Sweden's female players have called for unity to tackle inequalities between men and women in soccer, especially when it comes to money.Huge crowds have attended women's games in England, Italy and Spain recently and defender Nilla Fischer told Reuters that fans, players, sponsors and governing bodies would all have to work together to ensure better pay for female players.""I know that if I'd played in the (German men's) Bundesliga for six years, I wouldn't have any financial worries,"" Fischer said at the team hotel in Stockholm. ""In terms of percentages, you can't really compare. What they maybe make in an hour, I make in a year,"" the 34-year-old VfL Wolfsburg player added.The comments come after the U.S. women's team, the world champions, launched a lawsuit against their own federation last month alleging gender discrimination, which includes complaints about wages.Goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who plays for English club Chelsea, said players campaigning for equality in the women's game would continue to do so once they've hung up their boots. ""When we one day quit, we will fill places in these (soccer) organizations and keep the fight going forward. I do think it needs to be a kind of a public pressure, that we don't accept the way it is now,"" Lindahl told Reuters after a training session at the Friends Arena. ""I do however see the difficulties with these big organizations, FIFA especially, because it's their members that vote. I think we have to tackle big issues on the world stage in order for it to really change,"" she added.Fischer, who gave a fiery speech on the issue when receiving the Diamond Ball as Sweden's best female player in 2018, added that everyone in the game has a role to play. ""I think it's about the whole - I don't think it's about one organization or one clique or one part that is responsible,"" she said.Sweden are one of the 24 teams set to compete at the Women's World Cup in France from June 7-July 7.

"The surfaces of this documentary are, as is customary for its director, the Romanian Corneliu Porumboiu, unprepossessing to an extreme.If you're familiar with his work (â€œPolice, Adjective;â€ â€œThe Treasureâ€), you may recognize Porumboiu as one of the two men chatting in the movie's opening scenes. These take place by a soccer field, inside a now out-of-use milling facility, and in a gray room where Porumboiu and the man doing most of the talking, Laurentiu Ginghina, stand before a white board. The lighting is minimal, the conversation at ordinary pitch and volume, and the cinematic rhythm attentive but unhurried.Ginghina speaks of injuring his leg during a soccer match many years earlier, and how after several procedures he realized he would never play the game he loved at the level to which he had aspired. His accident, he says, was the result of â€œimposed rules, rules that weren't the best.â€ Then, using the white board, he lays out an improved version of soccer (or football, as the rest of the world knows it). In his vision, the field has no corners and the teams work in subdivisions.Following a scene in which Ginghina, at his office, offers not much help to a woman lodging a land-use complaint (the movie withholds the details of his bureaucratic job), he takes up the sports discussion again with Porumboiu at a gym, where a group of men rehearse some of Ginghina's ideas, then at an apartment Ginghina shares with his father. There, Ginghina is compelled to wrestle with the viability of his ideas.Porumboiu (who in 2014 made the documentary â€œThe Second Game,â€ about a soccer match refereed by his father) implies that Ginghina's proposals would make the game something other than soccer. â€œFootball 2.0,â€ Ginghina says. He reels off more versions in sequence, and Porumboiu interjects, â€œinfinite football.â€Robert Coover's 1968 novel â€œThe Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.â€ depicted the world of a man who conducted an imaginary professional baseball season entirely through rolls of dice. Its thematic argument was that the only life is the life of the mind. â€œInfinite Footballâ€ has similar concerns but somewhat more of a metaphysical bent.While the movie has allegorical resonances with the political and human rights disasters of 20th-century Romania, by the end, its surfaces, while remaining superficially unimpressive, open up as the film moves from epistemological speculation onto a plane of mysticism. This relatively short film contains worlds."
"PRESTON, England — A British jury failed to reach a decision Wednesday on whether the man in control of police operations at the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium tragedy that left 96 people dead is guilty of gross negligence manslaughter.Jurors at Preston Crown Court in northern England deliberated for eight days in the case of David Duckenfield, 74, who has denied 95 counts. The victims, all Liverpool fans, died in a crush in the stadium during a soccer match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.There can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries.A former official of Sheffield Wednesday soccer club, Graham Mackrell, 69, was found guilty of failing to discharge his duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The club's home ground was Hillsborough.Mackrell is to be sentenced on May 13. He faces a maximum sentence of an unlimited fine.Prosecutors said they will seek a retrial for Duckenfield.""I recognize that these developments will be difficult for the families affected by the Hillsborough disaster,"" said Sue Hemming, director of legal services for the Crown Prosecution Service.The original verdicts of accidental death for the victims were overturned in 2012 after documents uncovered mistakes by authorities and a cover-up by police, following a long campaign by families of the victims of Britain's worst sports disaster.Liverpool reacted to the decision reached by the jurors by saying the soccer club ""can empathize with the frustration shared by everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy that the outcome was not definitive.""___"
"For the most part, Sunday's results from Serie C, the third level of Italian soccer, look like those of any other league around the world: Albissola 1, Arezzo 2. Alessandria 0, Arzachena 1. Cuneo 20, Pro Piacenza 0.Wait, what?That eye-popping score, and it's not a typo, is part of a larger tale. Pro Piacenza 1919 is a venerable team from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. But the team has run into financial troubles, and most of its players and staff members, sick of not getting paid, walked out weeks ago.The team was penalized 8 points by the federation, dropping it to the rock bottom of the standings, and forfeited three straight matches.One more forfeit and the team could be disqualified from the league.So for Sunday's visit to Cuneo, it was imperative that some kind of team be produced. Pro Piacenza, known as the Rossoneri, or Redblacks, scrambled. It mustered up some teenagers from the youth team, and a team masseur, for a total of eight players. The masseur's number was hastily added to his uniform with tape. One of the youngsters, Nicola Cirigliano, was appointed the player-manager.Unfortunately one of the players, identified by the Italian press as Isufi, had forgotten his ID card and could not suit up, leaving the team with just seven players, the minimum allowed before an automatic forfeit.The game progressed as you would expect with seven inexperienced players going against 11. Cuneo passed at will, dribbled at will, and more or less scored at will. A highlight video is great viewing if you enjoy discouraged players trudging back to the center circle after yet another goal. Cuneo went into the break up by 16-0.Good news for Pro Piacenza: Isufi's father retrieved his identifying documents, allowing him to join the game. Bad news for Pro Piacenza: the masseur had to leave the game with a cramp.In the end, Cuneo let up a bit, leading to the 20-0 final score.Hicham Kanis wound up with six goals, Edoardo Defendi had five, and hat tricks by Francesco De Stefano and Michele Emmausso were almost unnoticed.To be clear, although Serie C is a far cry from Juventus, the Milan giants and the high-quality play of Serie A, it is still a fully organized soccer league.Pisa, in the same division as Pro Piacenza, draws an average of 5,000 fans a game. The winner of the division will head up to Serie B, only a level below the likes of Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Ciro Immobile.But several teams at this level have struggled financially, among them Cuneo, the winning team Sunday. Matera has missed four matches and been disqualified.The Italian press did not like what it saw.La Gazzetta dello Sport called the match grotesque, â€œone of the saddest and surreal pages of Italian professional football.â€Even a player on the winning side was embarrassed. â€œI feel only shame for those who made all this possible,â€ Fabiano Santacroce said.Francesco Ghirelli, the Serie C president, told Radio Rai that a game like that â€œmust never happen again.â€And on Monday he made sure it wouldn't: Lega Pro, the governing body for Serie C, announced on Monday that Pro Piacenza had been kicked out of the league."
"The trick, with Aurelio De Laurentiis, is to sit and to wait. He tends to take the scenic route through a conversation; his answers come wrapped in anecdotes and parables, laced with riddles and rhetorical questions.There are times when you wonder if he has taken one detour too many, become so distracted by his own tangents that he has lost his thread. Listening back, it is hard to pinpoint how, exactly, a question about the Champions League's revenue distribution leads to a brief but powerful homily about the dangers of the â€˜Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, but it does.It is, though, no great ordeal. De Laurentiis might be most famous now as owner of S.S.C. Napoli, the Italian soccer team he rescued from oblivion and painstakingly restored to Europe's head table, but he is still, at heart, a film producer, a showman. He knows how to weave together a story, how to craft a compelling pitch. And when he gets to his destination, as he always does, it is invariably worth it.De Laurentiis is, after all, never knowingly short of ideas on how to revolutionize soccer, never without a sacred cow to slaughter, never without a tradition to overhaul. He has, at various times in the recent past, suggested cutting games from 90 minutes to 60 and advocated the effective abolition of UEFA, European soccer's governing body, instead handing power directly to Europe's biggest clubs.He is also never lacking an adversary, some villain standing in the way of progress, holding the game back through lack of imagination. His list has previously included not only UEFA but FIFA, Adidas, Nike, collective television deals and the Italian political establishment, among others. Many others.He does all this with a relish and a frequency befitting the scion of one of Italy's great cinematic dynasties. In his eyes, soccer (and life, most likely) is entertainment. Creating a stir comes naturally. It is all part of the show.Sitting in a hotel in Liverpool, England, in December, on the eve of what would turn out to be Napoli's final Champions League game this season, he did not require a vast amount of assistance, then, to land upon his current bÃªte noire.He would like, he said, to change the way prize money is handed out by the major leagues. He thinks underperformance should not be rewarded. Rather, he thinks it should be punished. â€œYou finish first, you get â‚¬100 million, for example,â€ he says. â€œYou finish second, you earn â‚¬50 million, and so on. But if you finish last, you pay a fine.â€This has been a recurrent theme for De Laurentiis this season. He has singled out Frosinone — a minor team from a town between Rome and Naples, promoted to Italy's top league, Serie A, for only the second time in its history last year — as an example of a club that arrives in the top flight â€œalready relegated.â€Clubs like Frosinone do not draw fans, or interest, or broadcasters to the league, De Laurentiis says. They come up, they do not try to compete, and they go back down, except with their coffers stuffed by what he sees as an unwarranted share of the division's television revenue.â€œThe problem is the small teams have the same rights as the big ones,â€ he said, adding, with a reference to a type of bread: â€œWhy should Frosinone have a season in Serie A, be given a slice of the pagnotta and then be relegated back to the third division? If they cannot compete, if they finish last, they should have to pay a fine. They shouldn't be given money for failing.â€After yet another tangent in which he dismisses an overmatched club in a major league as a mere â€œsparring partner,â€ he quickly builds up a head of steam. â€œPromotion and relegation is the biggest idiocy in soccer,â€ De Laurentiis says. â€œEspecially when you also have UEFA trying to force clubs to comply with financial fair play rules. Clubs should be structured geographically, so they can all be self-sufficient. If they cannot survive financially, if they cannot be self-sufficient, they should be booted out.â€It would be easy to listen to De Laurentiis's words, to hear the many and varied ways in which he feels soccer has gotten things wrong, and to assume that he holds it in contempt, that he has wearied of the sport in the 15 years or so since he bought up what remained of Napoli — â€œjust the name,â€ he has said previously — and set about reinvigorating it.His actions, though, are rather different. De Laurentiis is not distancing himself from soccer; rather, he is embedding himself more deeply in it. He has, for several years, been seeking to add another club to his portfolio; ideally, he would have liked one in London. â€œWe never found the occasion,â€ he said.He switched his attentions to the United States, investigating an offer to buy an expansion franchise in Major League Soccer. He spent months examining proposals in Baltimore, Detroit and Las Vegas, he said, but was put off by the cost of a team — more than $150 million, plus the cost of a new stadium, in the last expansion round.Then, in August, De Laurentiis received a phone call from the mayor of Bari, a port city in Apulia, down near Italy's boot heel. The local club, which played in Serie A as recently as 2011, had been declared bankrupt and had been relegated to the fourth tier of Italian soccer. The mayor offered De Laurentiis the chance to buy it.â€œI was surprised,â€ he said. â€œI don't know anyone in Bari. I have barely ever been there.â€More surprising still, however, is that De Laurentiis eventually said yes. Napoli and Bari are, strictly speaking, rivals, but suddenly the same family owned them: the older De Laurentiis in charge of the former, and his son, Luigi, given control of the latter.It was not, needless to say, a universally popular move. Though Bari's fans were broadly welcoming — â€œThey saw we were serious people,â€ Aurelio De Laurentiis said — there was dissent in Naples. â€œGet out of our city,â€ read one banner, slung from railings in the city the night the Bari purchase was announced.De Laurentiis insists that owning another team will not draw his focus from his first love. â€œNapoli is Napoli, Bari is Bari,â€ he said. His son, meanwhile, is adamant that the expertise he and his father have gleaned on the Tyrrhenian coast now can be applied on the Adriatic.â€œWe started from zero,â€ Luigi said of Bari. â€œWe had to create the brand, starting with a new crest, and then do all of the things necessary for a team: a season-ticket campaign, a website, the marketing, the social media, the jerseys, finding sponsors.â€The rationale, the younger De Laurentiis said, is obvious. â€œBari has a national appeal; we are the only team in our division being broadcast nationally,â€ he said, the result of a partnership with the streaming service DAZN. Apulia itself has seen a boom in tourism in recent years; the opportunity, the younger De Laurentiis said, was too good to ignore.The plan, needless to say, is to restore Bari to the top flight, even if that would create a battle with the game's authorities over whether two teams in the same competition can have the same ownership.â€œBari is a recognizable brand,â€ Luigi said. â€œIt is not Frosinone. It has played in Serie A. It has a long list of famous former players.â€It is not the sort of team, in other words, that Aurelio De Laurentiis would denounce as a sparring partner, a club whose only purpose is to pad out the standings and to pick up a paycheck. De Laurentiis might compulsively court controversy. He might prod and poke and provoke his rivals, and soccer's authorities. He might do it all in the name of entertainment. He is, though, as good as his word. Bari is putting his money where his mouth is. He thinks soccer needs to change. So he is trying to change it."
"NAPLES, Italy — Up and down this cramped pedestrian street there are little clay statues of Cristiano Ronaldo, unmistakable in their form: legs spread shoulder-width apart, arms shooting at the ground, hair gelled into a luscious wave.There are also fat Ronaldos; weirdly skinny Ronaldos; Ronaldos with faces that resemble â€œThe Scream,â€ by Edvard Munch; and many, many other Ronaldos that, in general, look very little like the actual Ronaldo.Together, the diminutive Ronaldos represent an ever-growing segment of the colorful Christmastime panoply on Via San Gregorio Armeno, a historical street in the heart of Naples, Italy, that has been known since the 1800s as a spiritual home of artisans specializing in traditional nativity scenes, or presepi.Many consider the traditional figurines from these Neapolitan workshops — intricate models of biblical figures crafted from wood, clay, wire and fine cloth — to be refined works of art. Yet casual visitors to the street these days might be more likely to encounter the clay statuettes of celebrities and pop culture figures that now dominate the famous street's storefronts and curbside tables.And in a soccer-crazy city like Naples, it is natural that soccer players, and the clay representations of them, have begun to receive top billing.â€œIt's hard to explain, but it's like a visceral faith,â€ Marco Ferrigno, a fourth-generation artisan who owns one of the most famous workshops on the street, said of the city's soccer obsession. â€œSo players can become idols — to the extreme, sometimes.â€Alongside all the baby Jesuses and the different Ronaldos, then, holiday shoppers can find handcrafted figurines of Francesco Totti taking a selfie, Kylian MbappÃ© with his arms folded across his chest, Lionel Messi pointing two hands to the sky and almost every current member of Napoli, the beloved local team.The statues can reference recent games, major accomplishments, trademark gestures or humorous incidents. The transfer market and league standings can dictate stores' inventory. Artisans can glorify players or antagonize them.The sidewalk stalls feature enough soccer players to populate a statuette World Cup, and the street, in turn, has developed a divided identity: part sacred museum, part tourist trap, part art gallery, part miniature Madame Tussauds.â€œThe market demanded it,â€ Isabella Esposito, 54, whose family has owned a store on the street since 1950, said of the dense display of soccer player sculptures in front of her store.It was not always this way. Nativity scenes became prominent in Naples in the late 1700s as an art form besides painting that the city's nobility could patronize. Over the next century, the city's presepi took on a distinct style: dense, ornate and full of life, situating religious figures like the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus on Neapolitan streetscapes alongside other generically pastoral characters, like pizza makers.According to Marino Niola, an anthropologist at the Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples who wrote a book in 2005 called â€œIl Presepe,â€ the nativity scene tradition experienced a dip in popularity after World War II. Niola said it was no coincidence then that the nativity scene — which he called â€œa ritualistic toy to play a metaphysical gameâ€ — started making a comeback in the mid-1990s, once artisans on Via San Gregorio Armeno began introducing pop culture figures to their inventory of statuettes.In the beginning, of course, there was Diego Maradona.In 1987, the Argentine superstar led Napoli to its first Italian league title — an event locals jokingly compare these days to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. And a couple of years later, Maradona became the first soccer player to appear in the city's nativity scene shops. (A national political scandal in 1992 known as Mani Pulite was another early muse for the city's nativity scene artisans.)Even today, Maradona is nobly featured in nearly every presepe shop on the street, always with flowing hair, always with short shorts.â€œHe was an idol, and becoming a figure in the nativity scene was a form of sanctification,â€ Niola said of Maradona.Not everyone has enjoyed the developments in the industry. Vincenzo Nicolella, artistic director of the Neapolitan Association of the Presepe, said he was concerned that the universe of acceptable nativity scene characters was expanding too rapidly.Since the 1990s, traditional shops have prominently featured figurines of politicians, actors, singers and even, more recently, Instagram influencers alongside the soccer stars. Traditional nativity scene figures, meanwhile, are often relegated indoors and out of plain sight. Nicolella grew particularly agitated last year when he noticed â€œStar Warsâ€ characters sold in the shops.â€œAn intervention is necessary to say, â€˜Hold on, please keep your hands off the presepe,'â€ he said. â€œWe cannot forget that we are speaking of a high quality artistic tradition.â€Many artisans and merchants, though, have accepted that they have to straddle the two worlds, sacred and secular. They say the soccer players and celebrities invite younger generations to learn about a craft that can otherwise feel old-fashioned.Sitting at a squat wooden desk passed down to him from his grandfather, Genny Di Virgilio proudly showed off the delicate handmade pieces inside his family workshop, which his great-grandfather opened in 1930. Like many of the other shops, the Di Virgilio workshop stocks little red horn amulets, which look a bit like chili peppers and are meant to ward off bad luck (â€œWe have a saying in Naples: â€˜It's not true, but I believe it'â€) and figurines that cleverly piggyback on international politics. (â€œWe sold a lot of statues of Trump last year,â€ he said. â€œMamma mia.â€)Di Virgilio said that the traditional religious figurines, some of which can cost thousands of euros apiece, represented most of his business, but that the soccer figurines, which are around 20 euros apiece, garnered the most attention from passers-by.There is a clay statue of Zinedine Zidane head-butting Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup and, nearby, a photograph of Materazzi holding it, a big smile on his face. In fact, the entire store (like Ferrigno's) is covered with photographs of soccer players holding their own likenesses in nativity scene statuette form. Di Virgilio coolly rattled off the names of players he has met — Edinson Cavani, Marek Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens, Mauro Icardi, Mario Balotelli — before trailing off.â€œThey become children again when they see the sculptures,â€ Di Virgilio said.Di Virgilio said Ronaldo became his top seller this year after joining Juventus from Real Madrid, and he has been happy to feature the striker prominently in the store.â€œI'm a Napoli fan, and an anti-Juventus fan, but in business we have to make amends,â€ he said.Such generosity is not extended to all players, apparently. Di Virgilio currently sells a statue of Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n, a former Napoli player, with devil horns and a sign that reads, â€œungrateful heart,â€ in Neapolitan slang. HiguaÃ­n was seen to have betrayed the city when he decamped for Juventus two years ago.At another store up the street, HiguaÃ­n is depicted holding a platter with three babÃ s — a vaguely mushroom-shaped, traditional Neapolitan pastry — symbolizing the three goals Napoli scored against his current team, A.C. Milan, earlier this season.Di Virgilio cringed at the idea that people might place one of his soccer player figurines inside a traditional nativity scene. But many do. Anyway, he said, customers in the last couple of years have been coming into his store and requesting a new sort of product: clay figurines of themselves.Could a celebrity-obsessed generation give way to a cohort of narcissists?â€œI have 30 of them to make before Dec. 24,â€ he said last week, shrugging.Brando de Leonardis contributed reporting."
"OSTERSUND, Sweden — From the Italian capital to western Mexico to a club located 200 miles from the Arctic Circle, a player who Alex Ferguson said ""possessed as much natural talent as any youngster"" at Manchester United is going to great lengths to revive his career.And be sure, Ravel Morrison really will be out of his comfort zone at Swedish team Ostersund.Forget the climate, which sees temperatures typically dip below minus-20 degrees C (minus-4 degrees F) in winter. Forget the sleepy nature of this small city in the middle of Sweden, which is known more for its winter sports than its soccer.Morrison, once regarded as the top English soccer talent of his generation, has taken on perhaps his biggest challenge yet because Ostersund might just be the most quirky and unconventional team around.The club prides itself on developing its players as people before sportsmen. Through what it calls its ""Culture Academy,"" players are faced with challenges to their mental process, their decision-making under pressure.""We have to do a stand-up comedy show at the end of this season,"" Ostersund coach Ian Burchnall said. ""We'll have to do comedy sketches and stuff. Every player and member of staff. It will be like a two-hour performance (in the city theater).""One year, they performed Swan Lake in front of the city's inhabitants. Last year, Burchnall was dressed up as one of the Sex Pistols, singing songs as part of an end-of-season musical production.""It's in all of our contracts, we are all in on it,"" Burchnall said. ""Ravel will do it, everyone will.""Quite simply, Ostersund has to do things differently, and that encompasses its transfer policy, too. To keep pace with the richer clubs from southern Sweden, Ostersund — which was in the country's fourth division as recently as 2011 — has become renowned for targeting players who have been rejected, made mistakes in their younger years, and who have failed to reach their potential for whatever reason.Morrison fits that bill.As a youngster a decade ago at United, Morrison was so good that Rio Ferdinand, a senior player at the time, described him as a ""superhero"" in a youth team that contained Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard. Ferdinand recalls him and Wayne Rooney being called over by Ferguson, who said of Morrison: ""This is the best kid you will ever see.""He only made three appearances — at the age of 17 — for United's senior team, however, as concerns grew about his attitude and the company he was keeping off the field.He ""kept getting into trouble,"" Ferguson wrote in his autobiography, and Morrison was sold to West Ham in 2012. There, and in later loan spells at Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff, he only showed flashes of his talent. In 2015, he moved to Italian club Lazio but was barely used, and he had a brief but enjoyable loan stint at Mexican side Atlas, in Guadalajara, in the 2017-18 season.Now, he is in Ostersund, the most northerly and remote team in Sweden's top division, and will make his league debut on Sunday against AIK on the first weekend of the season.""I've come here to rebuild myself,"" said the 26-year-old Morrison, who described himself as ""just a young, humble person from Manchester.""""I want to enjoy it and enjoy football again,"" he said.Martin Johansson, Ostersund's chief executive, said the club had no concerns about signing Morrison.""We've previously had players who have been convicted, had a history and been, you know, labeled as a trouble-maker in the media,"" Johansson said. ""I think the climate and the culture we have at the club probably appeals to him, in a sense where he can perhaps enjoy his football again.""In one of the team's last practice sessions before the AIK game, Morrison showed the touch and vision that got pundits and coaches so excited when he was young. Dropping deep, spraying the ball to either flank, flicking neat layoffs, Morrison was a cut above his teammates.""He had a great training session then, didn't he?"" said Burchnall, a twinkle in his eye.Burchnall knows all about Morrison from his time as a youth coach in northern England when his teams played against United.""He was a fantastic talent, and still is,"" Burchnall said. ""I think it's so easy for people to say he hasn't fulfilled his potential. But he is still young really, he still has years ahead of him.""Morrison signed a 4Â½-month contract with Ostersund, taking him to the Swedish summer and the midway point of the season. He will then have to decide whether he wants to extend his deal, or perhaps return fitter and fresher to England.Whatever happens, it will be an interesting ride.""It's a big move for him,"" Johansson said. ""As you know, it's a very cold place, it's a different climate to almost everywhere in Europe. We are just enjoying having him now. Let's see what the future holds.""______"
"As Rudy Meredith was inducted into the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame in January to honor his 24-year run as Yale women's soccer coach, he sprinkled his hallmark humor and humility throughout his remarks.He recounted how his wife was on the opposite sideline for the University of Hartford when they met in the early 2000s. And he saluted several people in the audience while repeatedly expressing â€œthankfulness,â€ recalled Bill Duffy, a middle school principal and soccer lifer who served as master of ceremonies.There was nothing in Mr. Meredith's words, Mr. Duffy said, â€œthat would refer to anything that was going on.â€Despite Mr. Meredith's placid demeanor, people who knew him best had recently begun to detect changes in his behavior. He seemed to be more anxious. He appeared less enthusiastic about soccer, even before he resigned as Yale's coach in November. He paid little attention to recruiting. He played poorly in pickleball, a paddle sport he usually excelled at.In hindsight, those hints of stress and fatigue coincided with revelations that Mr. Meredith, 51, had been the linchpin of a sprawling federal investigation into corrupt college admissions schemes that exploded into public view this week.At the heart of the scandal was a consultant, William Singer, who took $25 million to help fix exam scores or fraudulently misclassify prospective students as recruited athletes to boost their chances of being admitted to elite colleges. But the person who led federal authorities to Mr. Singer, according to court papers filed on Tuesday, was Mr. Meredith.In a Boston hotel on April 12, 2018, Mr. Meredith solicited a $450,000 bribe from the parent of a prospective college student in exchange for saving a Yale soccer recruitment spot for his daughter. Mr. Meredith took $2,000 from the parent, and directed the parent to wire future payments to a bank account in Connecticut. But the F.B.I. was secretly recording the conversation, the charging documents said. Then six days later, the parent, who was working with the authorities, wired $4,000 to Mr. Meredith from a bank account in Boston that the F.B.I. controlled, giving the government evidence of wire fraud.With the authorities on to Mr. Meredith, he told them about a deal he had struck in November 2017, when Mr. Singer had introduced him to a man who wanted his daughter to attend Yale. Mr. Singer helped doctor the application to make it seem as though she was the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in Southern California, even though she did not play at that level, according to the government documents. But Mr. Meredith told the admissions office he wanted to recruit her, and after she was admitted, Mr. Singer paid the coach $400,000.Late Friday, Yale released a statement in which it said one student involved in the scheme was admitted and is attending now, while the other was denied admission. In the statement, Peter Salovey, the university president, called the criminal actions â€œan affront to our community's deeply held values of fairness, inclusion and honesty.â€ Mr. Salovey said the university was starting an internal investigation into its admissions process.Prosecutors said on Tuesday that Mr. Meredith had agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud, honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.Mr. Meredith did not respond to a request for comment. Paul Thomas, Mr. Meredith's lawyer, who works at a New Haven firm founded by Felice Duffy, a former Yale soccer coach who later became a federal prosecutor and lawyer, declined to comment.It was a dramatic fall for a man considered to be a Yale institution. Mr. Meredith started as an assistant coach in 1992, rose to head coach in 1995 and led the team to its first unshared Ivy League title in 2005.The charges blindsided virtually everyone who knew Mr. Meredith, according to interviews with more than a dozen former players and others connected to Yale or soccer. Mr. Meredith was generous and well liked, and did not appear to have any health, financial or personal problems.â€œI'm both appalled and sympathetic — I would never have thought that he was capable of doing this,â€ said Sharon Eisen, a veterinarian who became friendly with the Merediths in recent years through pickleball, in which Mr. Meredith is a national-level player and coach. â€œOn the one hand, I know them and like them personally. But on the other hand, I've lost all respect. So greedy. So immoral.â€Mr. Meredith grew up modestly in the Rockville, Md., area, and was an all-state soccer player at Richard Montgomery High School. But he failed classes while at Montgomery College, and almost quit school. After undergoing tests at the urging of his coach and being found to have a learning disability, he turned his life around, and ultimately transferred to Southern Connecticut State. The university's men's soccer program was then a Division II powerhouse. Mr. Meredith played on the 1990 N.C.A.A. championship team, then embarked on a career coaching soccer and teaching physical education.Robert Kehoe, director of college programs for the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, said he first met Mr. Meredith in 1996 and worked closely with the Yale women's team for the next several years as part of a development workshop he used to conduct.â€œHe had a lot of credibility because he was a very good player in his own right,â€ Mr. Kehoe said.Mr. Meredith quickly fostered an energetic atmosphere. He required players to wear costumes for Halloween practice. He bought bagels and extra food on his own dime for long bus rides to away games, while good-naturedly enduring the film â€œDirty Dancingâ€ at his players' behest.Yale enjoyed success in the mid-2000s, with the 2005 team reaching the third round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, knocking out third-seeded Duke in the process. Mr. Meredith coached several Ivy League players of the year and an all-American second-teamer who was profiled by ESPN. Meredith Speck, class of 2015, was the first Yale player in the National Women's Soccer League, according to Yale's alumni magazine.â€œThe thing I remember is how professionally he treated us,â€ said Theryn Gibbons, who was a member of Meredith's first recruiting class in 1996 and now ranks third on Yale's scoring list. â€œRefs were calling me Babe, and Rudy was never like that — we were athletes. He was very respectful, very sensitive.â€If anything, Ms. Gibbons said, Mr. Meredith sometimes seemed intimidated by the aura of Yale, and tried hard to be liked.â€œHe's not sophisticated by any means, and I know he would defer to people who he thought were smarter,â€ said Ms. Gibbons, who later became a federal prosecutor. â€œHe's very trusting, and gullible for sure.â€She added, â€œI'm not condoning what is alleged, but he's family, and you stand by family.â€Mr. Meredith's wife, Eva Bergsten Meredith, was also a familiar presence at Yale soccer events. A former national team player for Sweden, she is the longtime women's soccer coach at Wesleyan, and has also run, with her husband, Bulldog Cardinal soccer camp for many years.In 2013, in what former players said was an unusual move, the Yale women's coaching position itself was endowed in Mr. Meredith's name, thanks to an anonymous donation: For a time, Rudy Meredith was the Rudolph L. Meredith Head Coach of Women's Soccer. Even after Mr. Meredith's resignation in November, the name stuck: When Brendan Flaherty was hired as Mr. Meredith's replacement the next month, it was as the Loring Family and Rudolph L. Meredith Head Coach of Women's Soccer.Now, Mr. Flaherty is listed on Yale's website as simply the Loring Family coach. It was not immediately clear when or why Yale made the change. A university spokesman said Mr. Meredith was not involved in funding and naming the position.In recent years, Yale's teams did not perform as well as they had in the 2000s, and players and friends began to suspect that Mr. Meredith was no longer as gung-ho about soccer.Adele Jackson-Gibson, a Yale goalkeeper who graduated in 2013 and is now a freelance writer in Brooklyn, said she â€œcould feel people become more defeated over time.â€ She added, â€œPeople seem tired and a little bit checked out.â€Some players, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to be ensnared in the investigation, also began to notice a player or two, every couple of years, who did not belong on a Division I team, based on their skill level. Some of those players came from wealthy families, prompting speculation that their parents had donated money in exchange for coveted recruiting spots.In August 2017, the Merediths purchased a vacation home in Fernandina Beach, Fla., for $125,000, and took out a construction loan for $359,250, records show. The next month, Mr. Meredith was badly shaken, friends say, by the unexpected death of Fritz Rodriguez, a longtime assistant coach who had been Mr. Meredith's roommate and teammate in college. So his resignation in November 2018 did not come as a complete surprise to some.What few knew, of course, was that he had been cooperating with federal authorities for roughly half a year.A Yale spokesman said the university learned about the scheme and the federal investigation only after the announcement that he was leaving.Mr. Duffy, the M.C. at the Hall of Fame ceremony, summed up the feelings of many people close to Mr. Meredith when he said that he was still processing the gravity of the scandal.â€œIn the soccer community, we're saddened by Rudy's personal involvement, whatever that may be,â€ he said. â€œI think more people are angry that more deserving players were overlooked.â€"
"In a week when Europe's top soccer executives have hunkered down amid a wave of unprecedented leaks, the leader of Spain's league took the opportunity to go on the attack.Emboldened by recent leaks of documents that implicate Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain in possible attempts to obscure their spending and establish cozy relationships with soccer regulators, the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, said in an interview that the two clubs — and others that flout soccer financial rules — should face punishments that he says are long overdue.â€œIt was clear in the past that they were making dirty tricks; everything is crystal clear now,â€ Tebas said of City and P.S.G., three days after the surfacing of leaked documents that appeared to confirm his long-held complaints the clubs had manipulated financial control measures.Still, Tebas said it was not clear either club would face sanctions, in part because of a tangled web of financial relationships that City, P.S.G. and European soccer's governing body, UEFA, have with financial powers in the Middle East. The royal family of the United Arab Emirates owns Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champion, and the sovereign wealth fund of the Qatari royal family owns both P.S.G. and beIN Sport, the network that has committed billions of dollars to televise the Champions League and other top competitions.That was why, Tebas said, UEFA has not acted to police violations. â€œThere's a conflict of interest,â€ he said.Manchester City, P.S.G. and UEFA all declined requests for comment on Tebas's remarks. In other news reports, all three have described the recently leaked documents as malicious and have questioned their authenticity.European news organizations, led by Germany's Der Spiegel, began publishing a cache of internal documents Friday. The documents, the publication of which has rattled executives at the highest levels of the game, also detailed plans for a potential breakaway league featuring the sport's biggest teams — an effort that appears to be supported by Real Madrid's billionaire president, Florentino PÃ©rez.Under one version of the so-called super league plan, more than a dozen of Europe's biggest teams would consider leaving their domestic competitions to play one another beginning in 2021. The clubs linked to the competition include two from La Liga (Real Madrid and Barcelona) but also Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Juventus — and Manchester City and P.S.G.Among the documents was a term sheet for a potential breakaway tournament produced by Key Capital Partners, the Madrid-based advisers to Real Madrid and PÃ©rez's construction company, A.C.S.â€œIf these big European teams want to create a strategy to kill their own football fans, they can create a super league and they'll succeed in killing these fans within 10 years,â€ Tebas said.Both P.S.G. and Manchester City have been sanctioned in the past over their spending, though UEFA has stopped short of handing down the harshest punishment — banning the teams from top competitions like the Champions League — though that fate has befallen other, less powerful institutions that breached the organization's Financial Fair Play rules.Other clubs have complained about what they see as unfair treatment.â€œThe FFP struggle is real for (some of us),â€ the Italian team AS Roma tweeted in response to the leaks.UEFA is once again reviewing P.S.G's finances after its recent acquisitions of the Brazilian star Neymar and the French World Cup winner Kylian MbappÃ©; Neymar's purchase more than doubled the world transfer record, and MbappÃ©'s move from Monaco made him the world's second-costliest player. P.S.G. is trying to block a new UEFA review of those deals through an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Tebas's charges of a conflict of interest were the most likely to drive a wedge between La Liga and beIN Sports, which owns the rights to Spanish soccer in multiple markets. But he dismissed any potential consequences for the league.â€œIf they're not willing to buy them we'll go somewhere else to sell them,â€ Tebas said. â€œThe stability of professional football in Europe can't be bought by money.â€UEFA's financial task force will hold its first meeting since the leaks on Wednesday. Tebas said he was planning to file a complaint with Europe's competition regulators if UEFA does not take action. But he may face questions of his own at home for his criticisms of Spain's domestic powers.The breakaway plan involving Europe's biggest clubs is something PÃ©rez, the Real Madrid president, had been working on for years, Tebas added.Real didn't respond to a request for comment about Tebas's critique. Tebas and Real Madrid are locked in a separate battle over his plan to play an official league match in the United States, perhaps as early as this season. Tebas wants to use the match to raise the profile of the other teams in La Liga that are dwarfed by the popularity of Barcelona and Real Madrid.Barcelona is scheduled to play the first match against Girona on Jan. 26 in Miami, but players, unions, fans and — most important — the Spanish soccer federation all have objected to the idea. Without the federation's blessing, the game cannot be played.At a dinner last month, Tebas and Luis Rubiales, the Spanish federation's combative leader, failed to resolve the dispute. So Tebas said he was turning to the courts: La Liga plans to file a motion this week in Madrid to get the city's mercantile court to force the federation's hand.â€œWe think we have the right,â€ Tebas said.Hours after he spoke on Monday, there was another leak, implicating more executives. â€œThey can hack me tomorrow if they want,â€ he said. â€œThey won't find any dirty tricks in my emails.â€"
"Over the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport's most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto's fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen's business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto's actions.â€œBased on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,â€ said William Bourdon, Pinto's lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. â€œWithout Pinto, this wouldn't have been possible.â€Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto's lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport's financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs' books or a players' contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.â€œFor me, it doesn't make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,â€ Bourdon said. â€œThis is the key point.â€Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany's tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.â€œWe expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,â€ Bourdon said, â€œthat on one hand he's being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.â€Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, HervÃ© Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani's disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank's agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain's high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto's extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company's documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately â€œdidn't follow throughâ€ with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as â€œa tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.â€Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as â€œJohn.â€ Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the â€œcomputer geniusâ€ behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks' Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with â€œ#catchmeifyoucan.â€In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto's lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.â€œJurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,â€ Bourdon said. â€œYou could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it's not a crime.â€œIt will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.â€"
"RIO DE JANEIRO — Even in death the haggling went on.Christian EsmÃ©rio was going to be the one — his family had been sure of it.He was 15 and towering, a soccer player with an easy smile that belied his prowess between the goal posts. Already there was talk of contracts, and of buying a home for his parents, who had poured all their savings into the dream that their son might be the next great Brazilian soccer export — the next Ronaldo, Ronaldinho or Neymar.Now, his father stood in a daze of grief outside a Rio office building, surrounded by lawyers. Just days earlier, Christian had burned to death in a fire at the youth academy of one of South America's most famous soccer clubs, Flamengo. He was one of 10 players killed.The deaths lifted the veil over international soccer's biggest production line, and raised sweeping questions about a brutal apparatus that chews up untold numbers of young Brazilian boys for every star it mints.But for the moment, as lawyers sparred over how much money families of the players killed in the blaze should get, there was just one simple question: What was Christian worth?â€œDreams.â€The word hung in the air as Rafael Stival let out a sigh.Mr. Stival's for-profit talent scouting operation had posted a note on Facebook mourning three of its graduates who had died in the fire at Flamengo. Since then, the messages had been pouring in.They were not condolences. The Facebook post had inadvertently acted as an advertisement — a signal to ambitious parents that Mr. Stival's organization could get their boys into not just any club, but the great Flamengo. They wanted Mr. Stival to give their boys a chance.The soccer world in Brazil is populated by a variety of actors, some drawn by glory, but almost all attracted by the chance of breaking out of poverty, maybe even striking it rich.There are the boys, of course, and their families. There are the investors and the middlemen like Mr. Stival, who trawl the continent-size country in search of prospects as young as 9. And there are the teams, many in a state of such financial disarray that only the sale of the latest star keeps them afloat.The profits from investing wisely, and early, in even a single player can run into the tens of millions of dollars.To many in the game, the industry has grown out of control. It has morphed from a system intended to develop promising players into an international market whose value is $7 billion a year, according to soccer's global governing body, FIFA. In this speculative environment, talented young athletes — some of them children — are bought and sold like any other raw material. In Brazil, the best ones are even referred to that way: as â€œgems.â€No one knows for sure how many boys are in Brazil's youth soccer system.There are no official figures. Estimates range from 12,000 to 15,000, but that is hard to corroborate. The Brazilian soccer federation makes no effort to track players until they turn 16 and become professionals.But one thing is known: On the night of the Flamengo fire, Feb. 8, more than two dozen boys — most from poor families, and all hoping to achieve a dream — were asleep in a club dormitory.In a country obsessed with soccer, Flamengo prides itself on being the most popular team, with wealth that is the envy of rivals across South America. But that adoration and power, it appears, may have allowed Flamengo to escape for years any real censure for the treatment of boys in its care.In 2015, Rio state prosecutors sued Flamengo over the conditions at its training center. The prosecutors cited child-protection failures, declaring the conditions to be â€œeven worse than those currently offered to juvenile delinquents.â€City officials issued an order closing the facility in 2017, but never carried it out, limiting their sanctions to dozens of fines.In recent years, Flamengo spent millions to upgrade its youth academy. Last year, club officials boasted that the new facilities would be the best in Brazil.But the dormitory holding 26 sleeping boys on the night of the fire was a makeshift structure, consisting of six steel containers fused together. It had never been inspected, according to local authorities.Interviews with survivors of the fire and officials who investigated it suggest that a series of failures may have contributed to the boys' deaths:— Federal regulations require at least one caretaker for every 10 boys, but there was no adult present at the time of the fire.— Survivors said the only exit from the dorm was at its far end. Some of the boys may have been in beds farther away from the exit than the 33-feet limit required by the regulations.— The rooms had sliding doors, another violation because they can jam.— And while each room had a window, the openings were covered with grates.One boy who was in Christian's room told investigators their door had stuck when he tried to get out. The boy managed to slide through the window grates. But Christian, a strapping 6-foot-3 goalkeeper, could not. When rescuers got to him, his body was so badly charred he could be identified only through dental records.Flamengo officials did not respond to interview requests. But in February, its president, Rodolfo Landim, denied knowing about any irregularities when he spoke at a news conference after the fire.â€œOur goal is to solve this problem as quickly as possible,â€ he said.Soccer is hardly the only industry to attract Brazil's desperate.Sergio Rangel, a journalist who has covered the sport for three decades, says the youth-training system reminds him of the giant gold mine in Serra Pelada. The horrific conditions there were immortalized by the photographer SebastiÃ£o Salgado in the 1980s.Desperately poor men from all over the country swarmed the mine's open pit, turning over rocks in the hope of finding the nugget that would change their lives.Soccer has also been a fool's gold of sorts for many families. Some of them move hundreds, even thousands of miles to enroll their sons in training programs that will sort, scrutinize and, more often than not, reject their child as worthless.â€œPick one up, turn it over, and throw it away if it's no good,â€ Mr. Rangel said.The young men are not just disposable. To those who run the industry, they are often indistinguishable.That much was clear at a memorial for the 10 players who died at Flamengo. Midway through the service, a team official rushed to cover a large montage of photos of the boys: someone had realized that a player who survived had been mistakenly included.The streets of XerÃ©m, about 50 kilometers outside Rio, teem with boys of various ages in red, green and white jerseys — the colors of the Fluminense soccer club.Until the team built its training complex there, XerÃ©m was little more than a swamp, locals say. But now, despite the humid heat that tops 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is home to players and families whose lives revolve around the club.Among them earlier this year was an 11-year-old nicknamed Maradoninha, for his resemblance to the former Argentine great Diego Maradona. Even in this hotly competitive town, Maradoninha was attracting attention.Two years ago, a talent scout from Fluminense saw the boy, whose real name is Leandro Gomes Feitosa, play in a local tournament and approached his family. The boy was only 9, and Brazilian law does not allow soccer clubs to house children under 14. But if the family could get to Rio, the scout said, Fluminense would train him. A group of local businessmen put up the money — for a cut of future proceeds — and the family moved more than 1,200 miles, from the town of Palmas to XerÃ©m, to pursue the dream.Almost all the families living in their community of 26 rowhouses have a similar story, Maradoninha's father, Evandro Feitosa, said.Maradoninha may not be old enough for high school, but he knows his family's future is tied to his skills with a soccer ball. â€œGod willing,â€ he said, â€œI'll become a big player to help my family in Palmas, my family here and those in need.â€The chances of making it are slim. Fewer than 5 percent of the soccer prospects in Brazil will ever make it as professionals, by most estimates. Fewer still will earn a decent wage in the game. A study published by the Brazilian soccer federation in 2016 found that 82 percent of soccer players in the country earned less than 1,000 reais ($265) each month.And for Maradoninha and his family, the odds recently got even slimmer: Fluminense released him.Whatever the odds, whatever the hardship, there are enough soccer success stories to feed the hopes of young boys and families who have little else to aspire to.There is Neymar, so successful he is more international brand than player. He is the product of a humble neighborhood on the outskirts of SÃ£o Paulo. There are Rivaldo, Ronaldo and RomÃ¡rio, three former Brazilian World Cup winners, all awarded the title of best player in the world in their time by FIFA.And most recently, there is Vinicius Junior, a flashy forward who rose out of Flamengo's youth ranks. He once trained on the same fields as the 10 boys killed in the fire, and then he began living the dream: in 2017, when he was 16, Spain's Real Madrid agreed to pay 45 million euros (just over $50 million) for his rights after he played just 11 minutes in his debut game.All of those players, and hundreds more, have emerged from the Brazil's soccer mill to ply their trade on the world's biggest stages.In his early days in the sport, Christian's parents used all they had — and borrowed from friends and neighbors — to finance his soccer dream.He seemed to be getting closer to his own version of the soccer success story. On March 5, the day he turned 16, he was expected to sign his first professional contract at Flamengo. His dream, years in the making, was in reach.He died four weeks before that birthday.Days after his death, his father, Cristiano EsmÃ©rio, was standing outside an office tower in downtown Rio where public defenders were meeting with officials from Flamengo. He was with a group of lawyers. One turned to him.When it came to compensation, the lawyer said, it would be unfair if Christian's family was treated the same as the others. After all, he said, some of the dead boys had been recent arrivals to the club. But Christian was different: He had been called up to one of Brazil's youth national teams. Clearly he was worth more than the rest.EsmÃ©rio nodded silently. He and his son had discussed money, too.â€œDad, let's look for a house,â€ he recalls Christian saying when he got word that he was closing in on a professional contract. â€œMy first paycheck, I want to pay for a house for my mom, so she doesn't have to suffer because she doesn't have water or electricity.â€A week before he died, the boy posted a tribute to his family on Facebook. Above two pictures of father and son taken a decade apart, he made a promise:â€œAll the sacrifice will be compensated, my old man.â€"
"The United States women's soccer team has been fighting for gender parity not just in the courts — suing the United States Soccer Federation last week for discrimination — but also in their uniforms, known as kits. And at least when it comes to the clothes and the Women's World Cup, they have won.On Monday, at a global event in Paris, Nike revealed the new home and away uniforms for 14 out of 24 competing teams, and for the first time since the brand began working with the WWC tournament in 1995, each one of them was made specifically for the women's teams, not as derivations or extensions of kits made for men. Three days before, to coincide with International Women's Day, Adidas released its new designs for four WWC teams.In the larger picture of gender issues and sports, this may not seem like a big deal. But the clothes athletes wear speak loudly about identity and allegiance, and have the power to help instill confidence. Clothes are also the easiest way for fans to assert their own allegiance, aspiration and personal connection. They are, above all, symbols. And now they are finally symbols of parity.â€œWe are shifting more resources to women,â€ said Amy Montagne, the vice president for global categories at Nike — and not just because this is the largest number of teams the company has worked with. (It outfitted 11 clubs for the 2015 Women's World Cup.) But because, Mark Parker, the chief executive, said, â€œWe believe this summer can be another turning point for the growth of women's football.â€Certainly, given Nike's current emphasis on women's sports — the Dream Crazier campaign, a series of new initiatives designed to support women's coaching and engage more girls — as well as its own experience with Serena Williams and the current focus on female dress in the competitive arena, it would have been fairly hypocritical for the company to treat its women's soccer kit as in any way secondary to men's. (Especially given Nike's own somewhat uncomfortable internal history with gender issues.)Yet it wasn't until 2015 that Nike began making women's soccer jerseys in men's sizes so that more male fans could buy them. And it wasn't until the players really spoke up that things began to change.â€œThree years ago they said, â€˜We want our own thing,'â€ Cassie Looker, the senior apparel product manager for global football, said in a call from France. â€œTheir own thingâ€ refers to both fit and to the design of the uniforms, which Nike refers to as the â€œstorytelling.â€According to Ms. Looker, the fit took three years and multiple four-dimensional body mapping sessions of professional athletes to adjust. â€œThey are shaped differently than the standard body type,â€ she said. â€œThey generate most of their power from their lower body.â€While male soccer players like a slimmer fit — â€œIt makes them feel more powerful, like superheroes,â€ Ms. Looker said — women are more interested in comfort and â€œlooking professional.â€ This meant a lot of focus on the length of the sleeve (the athletes did not want to expose too much of their upper arms) and the neckline, which ended up halfway between a V-neck and a crew neck, with enough give to be easily pulled over a ponytail. â€œThey want zero distractions,â€ she said.Most of this may be lost on the armchair soccer fan, though the storytelling implicit in the design will not. (In any case, the kits are available in two fits: athlete and â€œstadium,â€ or looser, for the weekend fan.) Though the kits rely on the color palettes of national flags, the difference is often in the pixelated details. â€œChile, France, U.S.A. — they are all red, white and blue,â€ Ms. Looker said, which can make them hard to distinguish. â€œWe bring it up all the time internally.â€What to expect? The United States jerseys have a throwback patriotism with (in the home kit) direct references to the jerseys worn by the 1999 team that transformed the profile of women's soccer in America: white, with red and blue stripes on the sleeves. The names of the 50 states are printed in gray on the back, and three stars over the crest nod to the three championships the United States has won. The away kit has tonal abstractions of stars and stripes on red (though they read a little blotchy from afar).Also tonal are the roses and assorted other florals on the four burgundy-red quadrants of the England jerseys, which is why France's hexagonal blue polka dots on white stand out, as does the Norwegian snowflake pattern that fades from red to blue, giving their home jersey an Empire-waist effect and uniting the shorts and top.By athlete request Chile, Nigeria, South Africa and Korea have the same pattern that the men's teams wore in the 2018 World Cup, though the fit has been customized for the women. (At least in Nigeria's case, the look was so successful that you can kind of understand why they didn't want to mess with a good thing.)And then there's Australia. Of all 14 Nike team looks, this will likely be the most controversial; a canvas of forest green, mustardy gold and white slashes and splotches that looks sort of like animal print meets modern art landscape painting. Together with the Sweden kit, by Adidas, which features the faces of female role models chosen by the players embedded in the numbers on the back of each jersey, it makes a statement that, on the pitch or the street, will be impossible to miss.

"A toxic political dispute is threatening to sink the Persian Gulf's biggest sports television contract, a development that could have repercussions for other broadcast rights agreements worth billions of dollars.The Asian Football Confederation, the governing body for soccer in the region, on Tuesday unilaterally broke its exclusive contract with its Middle Eastern broadcast partner, the Qatar-based beIN Media Group, so that it could broadcast matches in Saudi Arabia, a country where beIN has been banned amid a bitter diplomatic and economic crisis between Gulf neighbors that is now in its second year.The A.F.C's decision to nullify its contract for the broadcast rights to games in Saudi Arabia comes even after rulers there have allowed a major piracy operation, perhaps the most sophisticated in television history, to steal billions of dollars of sports content owned by beIN since 2017.BeIN's rights deals with the A.F.C., which run through 2020, are worth $300 million. The broadcaster immediately announced its intention to file a lawsuit to counter the decision to strip it of the rights to games broadcast in Saudi Arabia, which comes weeks before the A.F.C.'s president, Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, stands for re-election. His opposition in that vote consists of a candidate from the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, and another from Qatar.Yousef Al-Obaidly, beIN's chief executive, said Tuesday's decision was not a coincidence; he accused the A.F.C. of colluding with Saudi Arabia ahead of April's election.â€œIt is remarkable to see the governing body of football across Asia — which should, by definition, be apolitical — putting politics ahead of its long-term commercial interests and established legitimate relationships,â€ Al-Obaidly told The New York Times in an emailed statement. â€œWe will use the full force of international law to claim every dollar of damages we have and will incur as a result of the A.F.C.'s unilateral breach of our agreement.â€Previously, the A.F.C. had issued strongly worded condemnations of the theft of beIN's programming and threats of legal action against the Saudi-based piracy operation, dubbed BeoutQ.The dispute comes at a delicate time, with beIN Media and the A.F.C locked in negotiations over a new regional contract. The A.F.C. had tried to persuade beIN to agree to purchase future rights but without access to Saudi Arabia, the Gulf's biggest market.News of a separate deal with the A.F.C. for the Saudi rights was first announced by the Saudi soccer federation, well before the A.F.C.'s released its own brief statement on the matter almost 24 hours later.Salman, who is also a FIFA vice president, has made no comment. The A.F.C said its decision to stream games in Saudi Arabia on its own channels was an attempt to tackle piracy. But within hours, its content was available on other platforms across Saudi Arabia, including on the free-to-air channel Saudi 24. A promise to geoblock coverage so it could only be viewed inside the Gulf's most-populous country also failed, with the A.F.C.'s stream of its Champions League games available outside the kingdom.Rights owners across the spectrum of sports, from FIFA to the governing bodies for tennis and track and field, have lodged complaints over the industrial scale piracy of their broadcast rights by BeoutQ. The latest twist could threaten the billions of dollars in income those organizations are able to extract for their content, according to beIN. The company said broadcasters would be unlikely to pay vast sums for exclusive contracts if those rights could be protected.â€œThere is now no guaranteed protection of intellectual property in the region to due to the A.F.C. in effect endorsing Saudi Arabia's theft of world sport and wholesale disregard for the international rule of law,â€ the network said.CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first hat trick for Juventus to send the club into the Champions League quarterfinals with a 3-0 win over AtlÃ©tico Madrid on Tuesday. The Italian side fought back from a two-goal first-leg defeat.Ronaldo scored from open play in each half and then converted a late penalty as Juventus advanced by 3-2 on aggregate, ending AtlÃ©tico's hopes of reaching the final, which will be held in its Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.It was Ronaldo's eighth hat trick in the competition, moving him even with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and demonstrating why Juventus paid Real Madrid 112 million euros (then $131.5 million) for the Portuguese forward, who has dominated the competition in recent years. Ronaldo is seeking a fourth straight Champions League title; Real Madrid was eliminated without him by Ajax last week.It was the first time Juventus came back from a two-goal defeat in the first leg.â€œMaybe that's why Juventus signed me,â€ Ronaldo said. â€œTo help it do things that it had never done before. This result is a great push for the future. We're strong and we showed it.â€Manchester City also advanced to the quarterfinals, routing Schalke by 7-0 to progress on aggregate, 10-2.Juventus thought it had taken the lead less than three minutes into its game but a video review confirmed that Ronaldo had fouled AtlÃ©tico goalkeeper Jan Oblak before Giorgio Chiellini fired in the rebound.But a goal eventually came when Italy forward Federico Bernardeschi put in a cross from the left for Ronaldo to head in at the far post in the 27th minute. Ronaldo got his second goal three minutes into the second half, as Joao Cancelo put in a cross from the right. Although Oblak clawed Ronaldo's header out from under his crossbar, goal-line technology confirmed the ball had crossed the line.Juventus went all out attack and got the decisive third goal four minutes from the final whistle, when Bernardeschi was nudged over in the penalty area. Ronaldo converted the resulting penalty kick.In Manchester, Manchester City tied the record for the biggest win in the Round of 16 of the Champions League by thrashing Schalke.Sergio AgÃ¼ero scored twice in the first half for City, and Leroy SanÃ© rolled in another goal before halftime before Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus added second-half goals."
"LOS ANGELES — Members of the United States women's soccer squad (USWNT) have told Reuters their lawsuit against the national federation alleging gender discrimination is not just about wages but also improving the sport for women participating in it at all levels. All 28 members of the squad were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court last month and says the women are not paid the same as their male counterparts.While the U.S. men's team have voiced their support, the U.S. Soccer Federation has said it was surprised by the lawsuit, with its president, Carlos Cordeiro, saying it strives for equal pay and has boosted its investment in female player development programs.Midfielder Megan Rapinoe told Reuters in an interview timed with Equal Pay Day on April 2 that they were also pushing for systematic change. ""For us it is really important to really look at the bigger picture of the compensation piece,"" she said. ""I don't think you can talk about compensation articulately or intelligently until you have a conversation about funding across the board,"" she said. ""So whether that is youth teams or staffing for each team or promotion and sponsorship, you know, advertising for both teams, I don't think that that is equal yet,"" she said. ""So yes we are fighting for equal compensation but we are also fighting for this larger picture of investment in both programs equally.""Since the lawsuit was filed, some companies have stepped in to help close the pay gap. Nutrition snack company Luna Bar on Tuesday announced that it would give each member of the squad competing at the Women's World Cup a one-time payment of $31,250 -- the difference in the bonus paid to the men's World Cup squad.Sportswear company Adidas has also said that if the USWNT win the Women's World Cup this year its sponsored players would receive the same performance bonus payments as their male counterparts.'FLAWED SYSTEM'The players said change was also needed outside the United States. ""We are hopeful that FIFA is doing things to put more women in executive positions and more women within FIFA in general,"" striker Alex Morgan told Reuters. ""We still feel like they are very behind on the trend and we are hopeful that what we are doing today and the continual fight that we have will help FIFA proactively change the inner workings of the system that is very flawed within them as well.""Morgan said the team hoped to improve the lives of the next generation of female athletes. ""I think we realize the opportunity we have and the resources we have are due to the generation before us and we hope to increase those opportunities and resources available for the generation after us,"" she said.""We might not see equal pay among athletes within our generation but the hope is that the future generations will.""The women said the lawsuit would not distract them from their efforts to win back-to-back World Cups, and a fourth title overall, when they compete in France in June.""Success for us is very simple and it is very clear from the first second that you get on the team, whether it is like a passing pattern or a small-sided game or a friendly or a World Cup final -- it's winning,"" Rapinoe said. ""It's competing to the best of your ability, it's trying to be the absolute best that you can so for us the expectation is always the same, success for us looks like winning,"" she said. ""It looks like winning the World Cup."" (Editing by Peter Rutherford)"
"(Reuters) - Australia captain Sam Kerr will line up against familiar faces when the 'Matildas' take on FIFA's top-ranked side the United States on Thursday but the prolific striker says all friendships will be put on hold for the World Cup warmup in Denver.The 25-year-old has starred in the National Women's Soccer League since its establishment in 2013, claiming a second 'Golden Boot' award as the top scorer in 2018 after netting 16 times in 19 matches for Chicago Red Stars.The U.S. squad features a number of her Chicago team mates, including midfielder Julie Ertz and defender Tierna Davidson, and other former colleagues at other clubs.""It's a different experience ... In the change-room at Chicago there was a bit of banter going,"" said Kerr after the Matildas' final training on Wednesday.""But there will be no friends tomorrow when we cross that line.""And I guess if there is, you go harder on your friends than anyone else.""Australia, quarter-finalists at the last World Cup in Canada, are keen to benchmark their progress against the defending champions in the friendly ahead of the global showpiece in France starting in June.The United States have a dominant winning record over the Australians but have been troubled by them in recent matches.They were upset 1-0 by the Matildas at the 2017 Tournament of Nations and were held 1-1 in the same tournament last year.Kerr said Australia had traditionally been guilty of worrying about the U.S. game more than their own, and that the team were more focused on developing for the World Cup rather than getting a result in Denver.""It is a good benchmark but at the end of the day this is preparation for the World Cup,"" she said.""We're going to be focusing on ourselves. We hope that we can win but the most important thing is continuing the journey to improve to get to the World Cup."" (Writing by Ian Ransom in Melbourne; Editing by Peter Rutherford)"
"BOSTON — The former head coach of women's soccer at Yale University admitted on Thursday that he accepted bribes to help parents get their children into the Ivy League school, becoming the third person to plead guilty in the U.S. college admissions scandal.Rudolph ""Rudy"" Meredith, whose decision to cooperate helped investigators discover the mastermind of the wide-ranging scheme, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to conspiracy and wire fraud charges.He is among 50 people, including the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, charged with participating in the scheme, headed by college admissions counseling service operator Rick Singer.Prosecutors said the consultant charged wealthy parents hefty sums and then used bribes and cheating to illegally secure admission for their children to universities including Yale, the University of Southern California and Georgetown University.Some $25 million in bribes were paid to coaches including Meredith who helped Singer's clients secure spots for their children as fake athletic prospects, prosecutors said.Singer also facilitated cheating on college entrance exams, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty on March 12 to charges including racketeering conspiracy and is cooperating with investigators.Prosecutors said Meredith agreed beginning in 2015 with Singer to accept bribes to designate applicants as recruits to the Yale women's soccer team regardless of their athletic abilities.In one instance, prosecutors alleged that Meredith in 2017 accepted a $400,000 payment to designate the daughter of a Los Angeles-based financial advisor as a soccer recruit even though she did not play competitive soccer.Singer sent Meredith a fabricated athletic ""profile"" for the student that claimed she was co-captain of a prominent California club soccer team, prosecutors said.In total, Meredith received more than $860,000 from Singer, prosecutors said.Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen said in court the scheme was uncovered during an investigation into an unrelated ""pump-and-dump"" stock market scheme involving a California man, who told prosecutors he was engaged in a bribery scheme with Meredith.The California man, father of a Yale applicant, was Morrie Tobin, who pleaded guilty on Feb. 27 to conspiracy and securities fraud charges, a person familiar with the matter said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, after receiving the tip, secretly recorded a meeting in which Meredith sought $450,000 in exchange for designating Tobin's daughter as a soccer recruit, according the person and court records.Rosen said investigators learned about Singer during that meeting. He said Meredith subsequently agreed to record phone calls with Singer, helping prosecutors build their case against him. (Reporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio)"
"BANGKOK — The trip to Thailand was meant to be a belated honeymoon for a young soccer player and his wife.But upon landing at a Bangkok airport last week, Hakeem al-Araibi, a political refugee from Bahrain playing for a soccer team in Melbourne, Australia, was detained by Thai immigration authorities, who have been asked to extradite him to Bahrain, where he said he had been tortured.â€œPlease, I am afraid if I go to Bahrain, I will be tortured again,â€ Mr. Araibi said by phone from an immigration detention center in Bangkok.At a court hearing on Friday, Mr. Araibi was served with a formal arrest warrant that paves the way for a possible extradition next week. He has the right to appeal Bahrain's extradition request.â€œWe want to go to beaches and beautiful places,â€ Mr. Araibi said of his Thailand visit. â€œI have only seen this immigration prison.â€His case is not only a window into how vulnerable foreigners are treated in Thailand, a country with a history of deporting asylum seekers.It also is seen as a bellwether for how well FIFA, the scandal-plagued body governing international soccer, is playing by new rules intended to protect its athletes.â€œThis one player sitting in detention is a very important indication of whether it's a new day for human rights for FIFA or will it go back to an old system where human rights abusers got away with their crimes and the victims were punished,â€ said Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch.Mr. Araibi's detention at the airport on Nov. 27 was a response to an Interpol request based on an arrest warrant from Bahrain, Thai officials said.But this week, the Interpol request, a so-called red notice, was lifted, according to Thai immigration authorities.Precisely why it was lifted remains unclear. But such requests are not meant to be used by repressive governments to nab political opponents overseas. They also are not meant to apply to refugees. Mr. Araibi has refugee status in Australia.Nonetheless, Busadee Santipitaks, a spokeswoman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the case against Mr. Araibi was continuing.â€œWe have received a provisional arrest request from Bahrain and are in the process of considering the matter in accordance with our domestic laws and regulations,â€ she said.â€œEven though Interpol seems to have lifted the red notice, the arrest warrant against him from Bahrain still stands,â€ said Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn, the immigration chief of Thailand.Mr. Araibi's case will need to make its way through the Thai legal system within 12 days, or by Dec. 14, because Thailand does not have an extradition treaty with Bahrain, General Surachate said.â€œThe Thai court will be the one that makes the decision whether to send him to refuge in Australia or send him back to Bahrain,â€ he said. â€œThere's no big worry about this story because we only follow the law.â€But human-rights groups worry that a political refugee is on the brink of being forced back to Bahrain, a country with a record of persecuting opponents to the ruling family.The United Nations â€œremains very concernedâ€ about Mr. Araibi's case, said Cynthia Veliko, the regional representative for Southeast Asia for the United Nations Human Rights Office.Once a star defender on the Bahrain national soccer squad, Mr. Araibi, 25, was swept up in the Arab Spring protests in 2011 when hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis marched against the ruling family of the small Gulf kingdom that is home to the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet.The crackdown by the Sunni Muslim monarchy was especially tough. Thousands of Shiites, who make up the country's religious majority, were imprisoned and tortured, human rights groups say.Last month, three Shiite leaders of Bahrain's opposition were sentenced to life imprisonment for spying, in what Amnesty International called a â€œtravesty of justice.â€In 2014, Mr. Araibi was sentenced in absentia to 10 years' imprisonment on charges of having burned a police station during the thwarted protest movement. Mr. Araibi said he had been playing in a televised soccer match when the crime supposedly occurred.Mr. Araibi later accused Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, a member of the ruling family and the head of the Asian Football Confederation, of doing nothing to stop the persecution of Shiite athletes who were thought to have joined the protests.â€œThey tortured me,â€ Mr. Araibi said of his treatment by Bahraini security forces. â€œThey wanted to hurt me so I could not play football again.â€In 2016, Sheikh Salman vied for the presidency of FIFA. Once considered a favorite for the top job, he lost the race to Swiss-born Gianni Infantino, amid a blitz of negative press about Bahrain's human-rights record.â€œNot only did Sheikh Salman lose the vote narrowly but in the course of the contest Bahrain's appalling record of torture and abuse of detainees was front and back page news,â€ said Nicholas McGeehan, an independent researcher on human rights in the Gulf. â€œThey will have considerable thirst to take revenge.â€Sheikh Salman, who did not respond to requests for comment, remains at the head of the Asian soccer body and is a vice president of FIFA.A FIFA spokesman said in an emailed statement that it had become aware of Mr. Araibi's â€œurgent situation.â€â€œFIFA supports the calls for the Thai authorities to allow Mr. al-Araibi to return to Australia where he currently enjoys refugee status at the earliest possible moment,â€ the statement said.The international soccer body has been troubled by crises in recent years, most notably a corruption scandal that thinned its leadership ranks in 2015.This month, members of the Afghan women's soccer team claimed a chronic pattern of sexual abuse by male coaches and officials. FIFA says it is investigating.As a result of human-rights controversies surrounding Russia's hosting of the World Cup this year and Qatar's planned hosting in 2022, FIFA unveiled new rules intended to better protect players and whistle-blowers. Sponsors had urged the changes.Brendan Schwab, executive director of the World Players Association, which represents the interests of 85,000 professional athletes globally, described FIFA's reforms as nascent.â€œThese structures, while groundbreaking, are in their infancy,â€ said Mr. Schwab, who is an Australian labor and human rights lawyer. â€œWe are still finding that too often enforcement is coming down to the political will of the leadership of football.â€As a registered soccer player, Mr. Araibi should be protected by FIFA's strengthened human rights policy, Mr. Schwab said.â€œIt is not relevant that Mr. Hakeem al-Araibi may have made comments critical of a FIFA official,â€ he said. â€œWhat is relevant is that he is a refugee in need of protection by the game's leaders who wield enormous power.â€Australian diplomats have met with Mr. Araibi and are calling for his return to Australia but declined to comment further on his case, citing privacy considerations.Thailand does not recognize refugees but it is party to two other international conventions that the United Nations says apply to Mr. Araibi's case: one against torture and the other protecting civil and political rights.Under military junta rule for four years, Thailand has extradited members of the Uighur Muslim minority to China, where rights groups say they are at risk of torture. Chinese dissidents seeking refuge in Thailand have also been forcibly repatriated.In October, a Thai court ordered the deportation of about 70 Pakistani Christians and other religious minorities who had overstayed their visas. The Pakistanis said they feared persecution if they returned home.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand, who led a 2014 military coup, visited Bahrain last year. His counterpart in Bahrain, Prince Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, was quoted in a Thai newspaper saying he considered Thailand his second home.On Wednesday, Prince Khalifa attended a function at the Thai Embassy in Manama, the capital of Bahrain.In 2014, Thailand, acting on an Interpol request, handed Ali Ahmed Ibrahim Haroon, a Bahraini who had taken part in the 2011 Arab Spring protests, into the custody of Bahraini officials.United Nations officials said Mr. Haroon endured such harsh treatment on the journey back to Bahrain that he had to be transferred to a hospital upon arrival. He is still in prison.â€œWe know what will happen to Hakeem if he is sent back,â€ said Sayed Ahmed al-Wadaei, director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy in London. â€œHe made a lot of powerful people very upset.â€Mr. Araibi said some of his former teammates from the Bahrain national team remained in jail.â€œI don't want to go back to Bahrain,â€ he said from detention in Bangkok, his voice shaking. â€œI want to play football in Australia.â€"
"In a dive bar underneath the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, fans of an obscure soccer team gathered after an entire workday of information blackout. They spent their Tuesday avoiding calls from family members and social media in its entirety because they didn't want to spoil the outcome of a match that technically ended long ago, halfway across the world in Germany.When their team scored what would be their only goal of the game, the supporters chanted raucously for â€œthe boys in brown,â€ thrusting their pints in the air, none the wiser that it was, as it frequently has been, already a lost cause.â€œOne of the biggest crimes you could commit with this group is to mention you know the outcome,â€ said Karl Paranya, who lives in the neighborhood and has been watching the matches since he first stumbled into East River Bar about seven years back. â€œIt can be a bit awkward because our cries don't do anything for a team that finished eight hours ago, but it feels the same for us.â€The team they follow is F.C. St. Pauli, a tiny club whose games no cable soccer package broadcasts live; it would be like expecting to find an Orlando Solar Bears hockey game on ESPN.But what draws Mr. Paranya and the rest of the supporters here is the team's unusual politics: F.C. St. Pauli is an avowed anti-fascist soccer team based in Hamburg that plays in Germany's second division and hasn't won the title in more than 40 years, though it runs a kindergarten inside the stadium, which displays signs proclaiming â€œno person is illegal.â€ The club has a worldwide, international fandom that defines itself in opposition to the racism and violence that characterizes European football hooliganism.The East River Pirates, as they're known, are still only maybe one of 10 supporters' groups in North America, and the only official one in the city. As such, East River Bar has become an unlikely spiritual home for German tourists, as well as a set of extremely devoted American fans who are far more interested in the team for their politics than whether or not they're in possession of the ball at any given time.â€œIt's not like we're that invested in the game play or the results,â€ said Shawn Roggenkamp, age 32, who helps coordinate the loose gathering of fans. â€œBut it is a reason for us to get together every week and bring this group of people together who maybe wouldn't have found each other any other way.â€East River Bar, which began as paint factory and was also a biker hangout in a previous life, was purchased about 15 years ago by Marek Gregorski, a Polish expatriate. His intention was originally to serve food, though he said the money for that part of the business fell through. The cheap drinks, cavernous space, and location next to the Williamsburg Bridge soon attracted a specific clientele, which Mr. Gregorski happily catered to. â€œAt some point we started to get some bike messengers, more and more of them, and we became a staple for hosting messengers and their parties,â€ Mr. Gregorski said. â€œThey get off work, and this is their first stop to get a beer and relax a little bit.â€The Pirates, who celebrated their 10th anniversary this past November, were initially regarded as oddballs at East River, which is decidedly not a sports bar, unless you count billiards or biking. Out front, there's a sign featuring an enormous gear and a vending machine selling spare inner tubes. The backyard has communal grills for customer barbecues in warm weather. The inside is sparsely decorated, and being a classic dive, contains only a couple of tiny televisions that are always on but no one pays much attention to. A regular game day will bring a mix of bike punks, New York soccer heads, and Germans on a pilgrimage to watch St. Pauli on a giant projector screen instead.Ms. Roggenkamp, who works for the auction house Christie's, was introduced to the cult of St. Pauli about five years ago when she was studying German through a private program. A classmate took her to watch a game at East River. Over the next year and a half, she slowly started to take on a leadership role in the supporters' club. In keeping with the team's philosophy, that typically involves passing a collection cup for charity during halftime. The ritual takes on an air of communion — a characterization that Ms. Roggenkamp agrees with.â€œI was having a conversation about it with one of my friends the other day,â€ she said. â€œAnd he was like, â€˜You talk about this as if it's your church group.'â€Jah Jah Brown, half of the Brooklyn-based rap duo known as Ninjasonik, has been coming to watch games at East River Bar for the past six years because he's enamored with the team's politics. He said that German tourists regularly walk into the bar, which is typically full of bicycles, and have to ask, â€œAre we in the right spot?â€In fact, the bar is a bridge between the two nations. Mr. Paranya remembered being with a Turkish friend years ago and lamenting that he didn't have a geographical allegiance to a soccer team as an American. The friend immediately pegged him as a would-be St. Pauli fan, though the comment was initially forgotten. Years later, he and his wife popped into East River Bar for a beer, where a game happened to be screening. After about five minutes, he realized who was playing. â€œI remembered that I was supposed to like these guys,â€ Mr. Paranya said. â€œBy the end of the game I was singing all the songs and had purchased a T-shirt.â€ A few years later, he took a trip to Germany, which he described as a pretense to visit St. Pauli's stadium. He wore his supporters shirt and made about â€œ20 new best friends,â€ some of which he now sees occasionally when they come to visit the United States and make their obligatory trip to Williamsburg.With about 10 minutes left in the game that Tuesday, the other team scored, though not many fans seemed to notice. When they sunk another goal and things seemed good and over, one of the Pirates' organizers, SÃ¶ren Thode, switched the broadcast to a YouTube video of the German entertainer Hans Albers's ode about the Reeperbahn — the red-light district district of working-class Hamburg. People finished their beers and said their goodbyes until the next match on Monday afternoon, though they, of course, wouldn't be watching until nightfall."
"LONDON — French soccer is on a selling spree.Still celebrating its triumph in the World Cup, France is on the lookout for buyers for as many as six teams in its top league, Ligue 1, said Didier Quillot, the competition's chief executive. Playing the role of matchmaker, he has been hunting for investments in a surprising place — the United States.Armed with a 32-page investor presentation, Quillot has traveled to the United States six times this year. He hosts lunches and addresses meetings. He urges sports bankers, American franchise owners and other entrepreneurs who have been lured by English soccer to take a look at France instead, as the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt did when he bought Olympique de Marseille in 2016.â€œIt's the next big thing,â€ he tells them.Quillot, 59, is a former head of one of France's mobile networks and one of its largest media companies. He believes he has the skills to â€œenergizeâ€ what he acknowledges has been a largely pedestrian organization fixated on rules and regulations rather than revenue and reach, even if it is roughly two decades behind the competitive curve in looking outside its borders for growth.While France's recent World Cup victory underlined the prodigious talent the nation has on tap, it also highlighted how far the country's domestic league had fallen behind its rivals: Kylian MbappÃ© was the only starter in the final in Moscow who plays for a French club.The French domestic league lags competitors in revenues, so players forged on the French production line are quickly sold to wealthier teams in rival leagues. The league has for sometime been classified as the fifth of the so-called big five of Europe, whose other members are the leagues in England, Spain, Germany and Italy.To change the dynamic, Ligue 1 hired Quillot in 2016.After nailing down a record deal for domestic television rights — it will be worth about 1.2 billion euros annually, or about $1.37 billion annually, beginning in 2020 (comparable to Spain, Germany and Italy) — Quillot is now setting his sights overseas.He wants American investors to bring not only cash but cachet and marketing experience to Ligue 1, even though most of its clubs lose millions of dollars each season and franchise values have been largely stagnant. His urgency for international diversification — from a country that has often had a less than charitable view of outsiders — illustrates how crucial to success international diversification has become in soccer, a sport in which players and clubs rarely looked beyond their own borders a generation ago.â€œIt's high time the French started thinking outward as opposed to inward,â€ said JÃ©rÃ´me de Bontin, a soccer executive with a unique perspective on the league's plans, having run Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls and also Monaco, one of France's top performing clubs, in recent seasons.Quillot said he had lined up potential American buyers for two teams, though he declined to name them. Separately, a consortium backed by King Street Capital and Fortress Investment Group is close to completing a $100 million buyout of Bordeaux.Yet some American bankers who have met Quillot remain skeptical, saying there are few people in America willing to sustain the annual $10 million to $20 million losses that can come with owning a Ligue 1 team, while waiting for franchise values to rise.American money has come to play an increasingly significant role in European soccer, especially in England. Those behind the bets have endured mixed results. For every Manchester United or Liverpool, there's an Aston Villa or Sunderland. Outside England, Roma, which is owned by the Boston hedge fund veteran James Pallotta, has lost more than $225 million since he took over in 2012.Also, French teams still have to gain a toehold in markets in Asia and the United States, where top clubs from other European leagues have marketed themselves for decades, said Edward Blackmore, who runs OGC Capital, a sports consultancy.â€œYou are competing against guys who've been doing it for 20 years and have massive reach,â€ he said.There is perhaps no better example of Ligue 1's visibility problem than the fact that so far it has been unable to sell television rights in Brazil, which is the home of Neymar, its biggest star. The country obsesses over the fate and form of the skillful forward, and his every move is scrutinized in the news media, but not a single second of live domestic soccer from France is currently available. Local broadcasters are unconvinced of the value of French soccer rights.Brazil is not alone. The French league's overseas rights are worth 75 million euros, or about $85.5 million, each season, or about a third of the fee Paris St.-Germain paid for Neymar. Rival leagues generate far more, with the Premier League collecting $1.3 billion annually.â€œOur No. 1 main task is looking for investors and our No. 2 main task is improving and increasing the value of our TV rights outside of France,â€ Quillot said.Indeed, such low fees for international media rights hold the promise of growth, which is attractive to potential owners. But to achieve it the league will have to come to an understanding with Qatar's beIN Sports, which controls the domestic rights.The relationship between Ligue 1 and the Qataris is complex. The country's sovereign wealth fund owns P.S.G., the all-star team that has drawn most of the attention to the league. Quillot refers to it as France's â€œtÃªte de gondole,â€ or display case.The Qataris have spent more than $1.1 billion since acquiring the team in 2011, building a roster headed by Neymar and MbappÃ©, two players whose transfers rank as the first and second most expensive in soccer history. BeIN's spending on domestic rights has fueled income rises for the other 19 teams, too. But the network has struggled to gain distribution in some countries, especially the United States, where it is largely a premium channel that only a fraction of American households receive.Quillot said he was in regular contact with Yousef al-Obaidly, the network's deputy chief executive, to improve the agreement.Quillot points to statistics showing rising attendances and the record-breaking domestic contract as a sign that Paris's dominance is not hurting local interest in the league. Still, rival clubs, notably Lyon, which was the dominant force in France before P.S.G.'s Qatar takeover, have at times been outspoken in their frustration.The league's new motto, â€œLa Ligue des talents,â€ alludes to its unrivaled ability to develop players. Europe's top teams usually feature a French-trained player. Seventy-two players in this season's Champions League started out in France, while 52 players at the World Cup were formed in an academy there.Often, players are barely out of their teenage years before they are traded to balance the books. Just eight of the 23 players on France's World Cup roster earned their living there.Right now, player trading is what is likely to lure potential investors to France, said Blackmore, the financier. That point is made explicitly in a brochure created by the investment bank Lazard to advertise St.-Ã‰tienne, one of French soccer's storied clubs.Listing 12 profitable player transactions, the team tells prospective investors it can â€œdetect affordable players with high potentialâ€ before developing their skills to â€œfinally make a significant gain thanks to a timely resale while not affecting the sporting results.â€Ligue 1 now has a permanent office in China, its only one outside France, and has signed an agreement to host three editions of its curtain-raising TrophÃ©e des Champions in Shenzhen. The first edition this season attracted 41,000 fans. It also shifted match times to accommodate viewers in Asia.Of course, the Premier League made this move more than a decade ago."
"NEW YORK — Everyone has a dream of making it to the top, but what happens when you actually get there? Only a handful of people even know what that is like.One of them is Alex Morgan, the soccer phenom and forward for the U.S. women's national soccer team - ranked #1 on the planet, by the way - heading into the World Cup in France starting this June.For the latest in Reuters' ""Life Lessons"" series, the 29-year-old idol for young girls worldwide reminisces about how she dribbled her way to global stardom - and talks about what will come after the final whistle.Q: Did you have a backup career in mind, in case soccer didn't work out?A: I had a dream that I wrote down on a yellow sticky note when I was seven years old. It said, 'Dear mom, my dream is to be a professional soccer player. Love, Ali.' My mom kept that for years.At the time there wasn't even a professional league, and I had never even seen the women's national team play. So I never even thought about a Plan B, even though I went on to study political economy in college.Q: When you did make it as a pro, how did you handle fame and wealth?A: For two years after I started on the national team, I couldn't receive any checks because I was playing for the NCAA. They have very strict rules about that. So my bank account in college was pretty grim, and my diet involved ramen noodles or finding the cheapest takeout.Since I was a student-athlete, they did let me eat at the university cafes, so I would usually be there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A lot of times I would be down to a few bucks, wondering how to get through the next couple of days before my food card was replenished.So when I did become a professional player and started getting paid, that was a nice change. Nowadays I manage to save around 70 percent of what I make.Q: What have you learned about managing money?A: As a professional athlete, your income isn't steady. Sometimes you get big checks and then sometimes you don't get much for a couple of months. Lump sums come in randomly, since a lot of what I make is through partnerships with sponsors. So it's been a learning curve for me to navigate that.Q: You have started numerous side ventures, so what lessons about entrepreneurship can you share?A: For me, with my book series and the movie I did for Nickelodeon, I like to take chances when the pressure is on. When I control things as much as possible, that is when I want to bet big, because I have a good sense of what I am able to do. So how I act in the business world is quite similar to how I act on the soccer pitch. I am happy betting on myself, and I tend to achieve more when my back is against the wall.Q: Where do you spend your philanthropic time and money?A: The main focus is kids and animals. I do a lot of work with Boys & Girls Clubs, and I'm an ambassador for UNICEF. I also support the ASPCA, because I am passionate about giving animals a voice. I even adopted a vegan diet, because it didn't feel fair to have a dog I adore, and yet eat meat all the time.Q: Have you envisioned what your retirement from soccer is going to look like?A: I would love to start a family, and live in southern California, maybe in San Diego. My husband (LA Galaxy midfielder Servando Carrasco) definitely wants to stay in the soccer world, and I am enjoying dipping my toes into new areas, like books and movies. It is an exciting time.Q: For that future family, what life lessons would you like to pass along?A: Something I would want for my kids is to be confident and dream big, regardless of what obstacles are in the way. That is what I did when I was seven, not even knowing that professional soccer was a possibility. I would love for that message to hit home with them. (Editing by Beth Pinsker and G Crosse)"
"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — China's recent attempts to emerge as a serious soccer nation after decades in the sports wilderness have taken some curious turns. One of the more recent ones is visible — or, rather, invisible — at this month's Asian Cup.Temperatures in the tournament, which is being played in the United Arab Emirates, can be stifling, making the sight of some Chinese players wearing long-sleeved undershirts beneath their jerseys seem puzzling.The answer lies in a semiofficial edict from Chinese sports officials issued last year that bans tattoos from being visible during matches. The directive applies to the national team but also to Chinese players in domestic competitions, like the Chinese Super League.Soccer is now a national priority under President Xi Jinping, and China's soccer authorities expect the country's best players to promote positive values to the next generation of athletes and their parents, some of whom remain wary of allowing their children to play a sport they consider to be dangerous or, worse, frivolous. In many ways, the no-tattoos rule is a microcosm of the never-ending wrestling match that China's central government conducts with its sometimes-dueling allegiances to modernity and control.The rule can be more onerous for some players than for others. Take the heavily inked central defender Zhang Linpeng. Most of his body, including the entirety of both arms, is heavily tattooed. He has been playing with a compression shirt underneath his national team jersey at the Asian Cup, though he has avoided covering the markings on his right leg and his neck.Other players have less work to do; a tattooed back or calf is often covered by a player's uniform, while a smaller bit of artwork can be hidden under athletic tape. (Zhang and others have managed to get some respite: Covering tattoos isn't mandatory for training sessions.)The Chinese soccer federation and tournament organizers clearly do not want to talk about the issue, however. At a news conference before a game with South Korea this week that will decide top spot in Group C, a tournament official tried to shut down a question about the tattoos before the Chinese national team coach, Marcello Lippi of Italy, could answer it.After it was rephrased, Lippi gave a short, diplomatic response, saying he was not unduly concerned by the edict. The team's captain, Zheng Zhi, sitting to Lippi's right, stifled a laugh but declined to comment on the issue.â€œThis is only a detail; I don't really want to talk about this,â€ Lippi said through a translator.A few months before the ink ban was imposed on Chinese soccer players, television stars faced similar restrictions as part of government efforts to control what viewers were being exposed to in the media. The soccer rules were brought in so quickly, though, that some clubs simply chose to heavily bandage their players before they took the field.The tattoo ban has become a lively topic on Chinese social media. Many people in China appear to support the official view that the players are public figures and should act accordingly. Others have ridiculed the move, which is at odds with a current trend in Western sports, where elaborate tattoos are now as commonplace as cleats and jerseys. Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the Los Angeles Galaxy is covered by them; Barcelona's Lionel Messi now has a long sleeve of art on his right arm and another on his left leg.Zhang, a defender considered one of China's best players, did not play in two national-team matches after the tattoo ban was established in March. The official reason was injury, but angry fans speculated on social media that China had been thrashed in matches against Wales and the Czech Republic because it was forced to play without Zhang, who they suspected had been benched because of his body art.China has been pumping millions of dollars into soccer since 2015. A sleepy national league is now backed by some of the country's biggest companies, whose lavish spending quickly attracted world-class coaches and players in search of some of the biggest paydays in the sport. A more intense focus is on creating a national team capable of transforming itself from a punch line into a force that can compete with the best in Asia and, eventually, against the best in the world.The road to get there has been bumpy, though, with soccer officials, typically political figures, chopping and changing policy, or introducing rules that some have found hard to follow.Last year, for example, top clubs were taken by surprise when the Chinese Football Association suddenly announced the best young players would be pulled from their club teams midseason and sent for military training, a practice that China has used with top athletes in other sports. Images of players with freshly shaved heads being put through drills by specialty trainers were beamed around the country.The effects on some teams were significant. Dalian Yifang F.C. lost four straight games and was pulled toward relegation after three of its young starters were called up.It is unlikely the best young players will be going back to their clubs anytime soon. Plans have been announced to create a team composed of young Chinese to play in the second division for a team recently created by a university in Beijing. The team could function as a kind of second national team.China's men's national team has not played in a World Cup since its first appearance in 2002, when it lost all three of its games. Its leaders have targeted hosting the event in 2030, and winning it by 2050. To do that, Xi has set a target for 20,000 training centers and 70,000 soccer fields to be established by 2020.The efforts are immediately visible. Private soccer schools have mushroomed in the major cities, and European coaches of varying abilities are being recruited at staggering rates.Lippi, who won the World Cup as Italy's manager in 2006, has seen much of it. He moved to China in 2012 to run the big-spending club Guangzhou Evergrande, and has announced that he will step down as national coach after the Asian Cup. He has stressed a focus on youth development as a path to China's soccer goals.â€œSix years ago in China there were not so many young players,â€ he said. â€œThis is the only way if you want to become stronger in the future. China has to continue to work in this direction.â€Regardless of how fast it improves, however, don't be surprised to see some players turning up in long sleeves on the way there."
"(Reuters) - The Australian women's soccer team will get an early indication of their World Cup prospects when they face defending champions the United States in a friendly in Denver on Thursday.The Matildas, under new boss Ante Milicic, made short work of New Zealand, South Korea and Argentina to win the inaugural Cup of Nations on home soil last month but will be keen to see how they stack up against the top-ranked side in the world.""It's a fairly daunting task to be involved in your first camp and be playing the number one ranked team in the world but we're playing with a fabulous group of players,"" rookie defender Liz Ralston said.""There's a really big emphasis on every drill, every session, making sure you make the most of it.""Ranked sixth in the world and boasting one of the world's top strikers in captain Sam Kerr, the Matildas have a much better chance of winning the World Cup than Australian men's team, who are ranked 42nd and were eliminated in the group phase at the global showpiece in Russia last year.The Matildas reached the quarter-finals at the 2015 tournament in Canada, their best result, and have only grown in confidence since.However, their preparations for the June 7-July 7 World Cup in France were thrown into chaos with the abrupt sacking of long-serving coach Alen Stajcic in January.Stajcic was dismissed for what the governing Football Federation Australia said was a ""poor culture"" around the team, rather than for failing to produce results.Milicic, appointed as a caretaker to steer the team through the World Cup, has proved a popular replacement and returned calm to a squad that was distracted by reports of dressing room disharmony.Milicic is keen to give fringe players a chance to shine at their camp in Colorado and has made five changes to his Cup of Nations squad, including the uncapped duo of UCLA goalkeeper Teagan Micah and Sydney FC defender Ralston. Experienced midfielder Katrina Gorry and Washington Spirit attacker Chloe Logarzo return after injuries, with 16-year-old striker Mary Fowler lured back after snubbing an international call-up by Stajcic last year.While more than half the squad play for U.S. teams, a large Australia-based contingent have had to get used to the freezing cold in Colorado quickly after traveling from balmy conditions back home.""(It's) something we're not used to, we're not used to the chill and it's a different climate and a different atmosphere here but it's been nice,"" said Melbourne-based forward Emily Gielnik.Following the friendly against Jill Ellis-coached United States, Australia switch to warmer climes in Turkey for a pre-World Cup camp before heading to France where they meet Italy, Brazil and Jamaica in Group C.

He is now on his way home after being discharged from hospital,"" the team's Twitter account said.Spanish newspaper El Mundo said earlier on Tuesday that Scaloni, who was named Argentina's permanent coach in November, was taken to the Hospital Universitario Son Espases on the Spanish island with multiple injuries.Scaloni later posted a picture of himself on his official Twitter account sporting tape above and below his bruised left eye and on his nose and forehead, with the words: ""Many thanks for the messages, a few stitches and now I'm off back home.""Scaloni will oversee the team's Copa America campaign this year, with Argentina bidding to win their first major trophy since 1993.The 40-year-old made seven appearances for his country as a defender and had a long, varied career which began at Newell's Old Boys, in Rosario in central Argentina.His longest spell at one club came at Deportivo La Coruna, where he won the La Liga title in 2000, while he also played for Racing Santander and Mallorca in Spain plus West Ham United and Lazio and Atalanta, retiring from playing in 2015.He became assistant to Jorge Sampaoli at La Liga outfit Sevilla in 2016 and followed him when he became coach of Argentina in 2017.Sampaoli was sacked in the wake of the side's disastrous 2018 World Cup campaign and their last-16 defeat to France, but Scaloni stayed on as caretaker coach before being handed the job on a permanent basis in November.

"MILAN — A black player for Italy's most popular soccer club won support from other European players Wednesday, a day after he was subjected to a torrent of racist abuse from an opposing team's fans.Juventus forward Moise Kean scored his team's second goal against Cagliari late in the 2-0 victory Tuesday and stood in front of the home fans with his arms outstretched. That seemed to trigger a furious and openly racist outcry from the fans.One of his teammates, Leonardo Bonucci, added fuel to the fire by saying Kean was partly to blame for the angry response. That prompted players on other teams to rush to Kean's defense.Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling, who is black, ridiculed the remark: ""Leonardo Bonucci ... All you can do now is laugh."" He also posted a screenshot on Twitter.""I support every fight against racism, we're all equal,"" Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba wrote in an Instagram post of Kean celebrating his goal. The Frenchman, who used to play for Juventus, then added, in Italian: ""Good Italians wake up, you can't let a small group of racists talk for you.""Kean, a 19-year-old Italian whose parents are from Ivory Coast, was insulted by home fans during much of Tuesday's game in Cagliari. He received a yellow card for faking an injury in the first half.His goal and ensuing celebration seemed to push the home fans over the edge.Cagliari captain Luca Ceppitelli tried to protect Kean, rushing to his side and pleading with the fans to stop. Instead, Ceppitelli was almost hit on the head by a bottle thrown from the stands.In his comments partially blaming Kean, Bonucci said: ""There were racist boos after Kean's celebration and (Blaise) Matuidi got angry but I think the blame is 50-50.""He added: ""Kean made a mistake and the fans made a mistake.""Matuidi, who is also black and won the World Cup with France last year, was subjected to racist abuse in Cagliari last year.The incident involving Kean is but the latest example of racism in soccer this season. Last week, several England players were targeted with monkey chants during the team's 5-1 victory in Montenegro.Former Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, a four-time African player of the year from Ivory Coast, said players who are being targeted should walk off the field.""Yeah, let's do this,"" Toure said at a UEFA conference on diversity in soccer. ""When something like that happens we have to send a strong message.""As criticism mounted Wednesday, Bonucci posted a photo on an Instagram story of him and Kean embracing.""Regardless of everything, in any case... NO TO RACISM,"" Bonucci wrote.Another teammate from both Juventus and Italy's national team, Giorgio Chiellini, defended Kean in a story posted on the club's website, calling him ""a positive figure of Italian football.""""The only thing he did wrong today was the simulation (faking injury), that he surely won't repeat, but he's here to learn,"" Chiellini said. ""He's a very positive figure and he certainly didn't deserve the insults he received.""Kean, who scored in both of Italy's qualifying matches for the 2020 European Championship, also won backing from Mario Balotelli — another black Italian born to African parents and who played for the country's national team.""And tell Bonucci that his luck is that I wasn't there,"" Balotelli wrote on Instagram. ""Instead of defending you he does this? I'm shocked I swear. I love you brother!""Kean hasn't spoken publicly about the incident, but posted a photo of his goal celebration on Instagram.""The best way to respond to racism,"" Kean wrote, ""#notoracism.""___"
"A political refugee who spoke out against a powerful ruling family in the Gulf moved one step closer on Tuesday to being extradited to his native Bahrain by the Thai authorities.A Thai court formally extended the detention of Hakeem al-Araibi, once a star defender for the Bahraini national soccer team, for 60 days, during which Thailand's immigration department can prepare his extradition. Mr. Araibi was stopped last month at an airport in Bangkok after a flight from Australia, where he had been living as a legal refugee after fleeing a crackdown on Arab Spring protesters in the small Gulf nation.Mr. Araibi was initially detained because of an Interpol red notice, an alert from the global police agency meant to inform nations about individuals with active arrest warrants, the Thai authorities said. While red notices are not legally binding, they can be used to detain fugitives so they can be extradited to the country where they were convicted of a crime.But red notices have also been abused by authoritarian governments that want to bring home critics who have fled abroad, human rights groups say. That is why Interpol over the past several years has instituted reforms that require the agency to vet each person who is added to the red notice database. Refugees like Mr. Araibi are also supposed to be exempt from red notices.Yet, critics say, Interpol has not been rigorous enough in ensuring that the red notice database is not being used to settle political vendettas.Nearly a week after he was detained in Bangkok, Interpol rescinded the red notice for Mr. Araibi, Thai officials said.By that time, however, Mr. Araibi was already behind bars in a country with a record of sending asylum-seekers back to countries where there is credible evidence that they will face torture or political persecution, including China, Pakistan and Bahrain.Thai officials said they were keeping him in detention because they had received an extradition request from the Bahraini authorities, based on a 10-year jail sentence for charges including vandalism that human rights groups say was politically motivated.â€œThis is a guy with a public profile who'd fled a country where he made credible allegations about being tortured to the point that he was granted asylum in Australia,â€ said Bruno Min, a senior policy adviser for Fair Trials, a global criminal justice watchdog. â€œWhy was the red notice on him allowed to be published in the first place? What this shows is that the system put in place is still not good enough to stop abuses from happening.â€Bahrain has a history of using red notices to force dissidents to return home. In 2014, Thailand, acting on an Interpol alert, turned over another critic of the Bahraini ruling family to officials from there. The United Nations said evidence suggests that dissident was beaten severely during his journey back to Bahrain, and he remains in prison.In 2014, Mr. Araibi was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison for having vandalized a police station. Yet minutes before that crime supposedly occurred, he was playing in a televised soccer match. The judge who convicted him is a member of Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family.After fleeing abroad, Mr. Araibi spoke out against a senior Bahraini soccer official, whom he accused of allowing the torture and imprisonment of members of the national team believed to have supported the Arab Spring protests in Bahrain. Some are still in jail.That official, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, also a member of Bahrain's ruling family, is the head of the Asian Football Confederation and a vice president of FIFA, the international body governing soccer.In 2016, Sheikh Salman ran, unsuccessfully, to lead FIFA. Concerns over how his family was ruling Bahrain helped to scuttle his candidacy. Mr. Araibi said that he believed Sheikh Salman had failed to stop his torture.Last week, in a rare political intercession, FIFA, which was been plagued by corruption scandals, called for Mr. Araibi's return to Australia.Australia's foreign minister, Marise Payne, has also urged Thailand to allow Mr. Araibi to fly back to Australia.The protests against the Sunni Muslim ruling family of Bahrain were broad-based, with some 200,000 people, many members of the nation's Shiite majority participating, human rights groups said. Mr. Araibi's brother participated in the protests and Mr. Araibi said in a phone call from detention in Bangkok that his brother's activity prompted his eventual torture.The sequence of events preceding Mr. Araibi's detention at a Bangkok airport on Nov. 27 has led activists to question whether Thailand may have informed the Bahraini authorities about Mr. Araibi's upcoming trip.In October, Mr. Araibi and his wife applied for visas to holiday in Thailand. In early November, that visa was granted. The Interpol red notice, which stemmed from a request from Bahrain, was only vetted and published after Mr. Araibi received visa approval from the Thai immigration authorities.â€œIn the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, the repressive Gulf states seem confident that their global hunt of expat dissidents can continue without fear of consequences,â€ said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy in London, referring to the killing of the prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.Over the weekend, the Thai Foreign Ministry said that Thailand carried out the detention after requests from both Bahraini- and Australian-based authorities.â€œThe detention was carried out in response to the red notice alert received from the Interpol National Central Bureau of Australia and the formal request from the Bahraini government for his arrest and extradition,â€ the statement read.The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, along with the Australian Federal Police, did not respond to requests for comment. But it would be unusual for officials in a country that had given Mr. Araibi refugee status to have also reported him to the Thais.Australia has extradited individuals with red notices on them to countries where rights groups say they could be subjected to torture, such as Egypt. And it is possible for different bureaucracies within one country to work at cross purposes, rights watchdogs said.â€œQuite often, with red notices, we have seen that there's not a lot of dialogue between two different bodies, like law enforcement and immigration,â€ said Mr. Min of Fair Trials, which has extensively researched abuses of Interpol red alerts.On Tuesday, Mr. Araibi's request for bail was denied, said his lawyer, Nadthasiri Bergman. He will be transferred from immigration detention to Bangkok's notoriously overcrowded remand prison while his case works its way through the courts. The process could take weeks.Mr. Araibi and his wife had wanted to spend a belated honeymoon in Thailand, he said. From detention, he described his bewilderment at how a planned holiday had transformed into the likelihood that he would be forced to return to a country where human rights groups say thousands of people have been tortured for their involvement in the crushed Arab Spring movement.â€œMy wife and I, we want a vacation,â€ Mr. Araibi said. â€œI do not want to go back to a torture place.â€"
"LONDON — As far as Derry City was concerned, it was a big game. A cup quarterfinal, on home turf, against one of its fiercest rivals from the League of Ireland should have been the sort of night to draw a raucous crowd, the gate receipts swelling the club's coffers.As the game kicked off, though, the crowd at the Brandywell Stadium, Derry's compact home, was far short of what Sean Barrett and his fellow directors had been hoping for. â€œIt was really bad,â€ he said. Derry ordinarily draws a couple of thousand fans to home games; for that game against Bohemians, it was down by a quarter or so, he said.He did not need long to work out why.The same evening, Manchester United was taking its bow in the Champions League, beating Young Boys, the Swiss champion, 3-0, in Bern. The game was broadcast live in both Northern Ireland, where Derry is based, and Ireland, the home of Derry's league.United, like the other great English powerhouses, has vast numbers of fans in both countries, so many that the local teams simply cannot compete.At a club where ticket money plays a pivotal role in balancing the books, where attendance and budget remain inextricably linked, that can be immensely damaging. There have been times, Barrett said, when Derry has postponed a game once it has realized United or Liverpool is playing on television at the same time.â€œThe hard-core fans still come,â€ he said. â€œWe have a thousand or so season-ticket holders. But we need to attract the floaters, too.â€A few weeks later, Andrea Radrizzani was bustling through the executive suites in the rather more luxurious surrounds of Stamford Bridge. He was at Chelsea's home for an annual conference at which soccer's great, good and other gather to network, brainstorm and pronounce their thoughts to the shoals of journalists working the rooms.This year, Radrizzani offered up an idea that could fundamentally alter the fabric of English soccer and make dozens of English teams suffer the same fate as Derry, or worse.Radrizzani is chairman of Leeds United, but also owner of Eleven Sports, an insurgent streaming service that now owns the rights to broadcast Spanish and Italian soccer — as well as Major League Soccer — in Britain.Twice this season, Eleven has broadcast a game from La Liga on a Saturday afternoon, in direct contravention of rules laid down by Britain's soccer authorities — and legitimized by the statutes of UEFA, European soccer's governing body — that no games can be shown on television from 2:45 to 5:15 p.m. that day.At Stamford Bridge, he confirmed that it had not been an oversight borne of naÃ¯vetÃ© — Eleven is a new player in the British market, having only appeared this summer — but a deliberate move.The blackout, he said, was an anachronism that needed to be challenged, and he was the man who would challenge it. â€œWe are too conservative, too relaxed, in this country,â€ he said. â€œWe need sometimes a bit of energy.â€So as fans all over the world are tuning in to Premier League games from England, only those fans actually inside the stadiums are able to watch any soccer at all in England. To Radrizzani, that idea is not only outdated but also hopelessly idealistic.Of the 53 member nations of UEFA, only three — England, Scotland and Montenegro — choose to enforce a blackout.Fans can gain access to illegal streams of games from all over the planet with just a few swipes of a smartphone screen; more pointedly, he cited the example of betting companies streaming games to their websites, apparently with the tacit permission of the sport's authorities. His company has paid millions of dollars to broadcast soccer. He does not see why it should be prevented from doing so.His combative stance initially attracted support from one of his main clients, La Liga. â€œThis type of blackout does not make a whole lot of sense,â€ Joris Evers, the competition's chief communications officer, told The Times of London. â€œIt is from a different age. We are aware of what Eleven Sports are doing and generally support them. People are used to watching things whenever and wherever they take place, on whatever devices they like.â€Others, though, were less happy. A week later, Eleven suddenly announced it would no longer show games during the protected period â€œfor the time being.â€ The about-face followed an intervention by England's Football Association — the body that chose to implement the blackout — to its Spanish counterpart. When the Spanish authorities contacted La Liga, it encouraged its partner to back down.Only, though, for now. â€œWe continue to believe that the blackout is outdated,â€ La Liga said in a statement. â€œEleven Sports is taking the right steps to challenge the blackout and we support them.â€ Radrizzani has suggested he will mount a legal challenge to the rule: one that is governed and policed only by soccer's regulators, rather than by law. â€œIf it goes to court, for sure we will win,â€ Radrizzani said at Stamford Bridge.It is a deficiency the vast majority of fans in Britain, though, are prepared to tolerate. â€œThe Saturday 3 p.m. TV blackout is part of the tradition of English football and maintaining it is crucial to the economic survival of many clubs lower down the football pyramid,â€ said David Rose, deputy chief executive of the Football Supporters' Federation. When the organization carried out a survey last year, 72.7 percent of fans said they wanted to see the blackout maintained, he said.â€œThey see it as a tool to protect attendances at lower league and nonleague clubs, who are far more reliant upon match-day income than those in the upper reaches of the game, who benefit from record broadcast revenues,â€ Rose said.On that, the fans, the F.A. and even the Premier League are all united. Richard Scudamore, the Premier League's chief executive, said last week that maintaining the blackout is a â€œsolidarity issueâ€ with the rest of English soccer.Its motivations are unlikely to be wholly pure, of course. The Premier League has found that broadcasting more games does not necessarily increase the value of its television rights. But its belief that the rest of the professional game and the thousands of amateur clubs who play on Saturday afternoons would suffer without the blackout is sincere.The problem, of course, is not with games from Spain or Italy being shown on British television — though Barcelona and Real Madrid, in particular, would be a draw — but the idea that high-profile Premier League games might follow.â€œOur attendances for evening games are about 20 to 25 percent lower than for Saturday afternoons,â€ said Chris Dunphy, chairman of Rochdale, of League One, the third tier of English soccer's oddly named pyramid. â€œThe big teams being on television absolutely, directly affects our crowds.â€Life, for a team like Rochdale, is challenging enough. Dunphy estimated that there were 29 teams within an hour's drive of his club's home stadium, on the eastern fringe of Manchester. â€œBoth Manchester teams, both Liverpool teams, Leeds, both Sheffield teams,â€ he said.He is conscious that his club, like so many, is â€œnot in an affluent area.â€ Rochdale has already cut ticket prices to try to draw a bigger crowd, but even that would not be enough if every Premier League game were live on television. â€œIt becomes much harder if people start to pick and choose games,â€ he said. Research suggests he is right to worry. One recent study, by researchers at the University of Liverpool and Lancaster University, suggested live elite soccer on television can cut crowds by as much as 16 percent in the lower leagues.It is here that the Irish example is especially relevant, an insight into what might happen should Radrizzani follow through on his promise to mount a legal challenge against the blackout, to change English soccer forever.There is a 3 p.m. blackout in Northern Ireland, but no such thing in Ireland. In Derry, at least, most pubs advertise Premier League games being shown live on Saturday afternoons, presumably being broadcast from across the border.In that environment, soccer in the Republic of Ireland has had to contort itself simply to survive. When Sky first bought up a tranche of English rights in the 1990s, the League of Ireland stopped playing on weekends, and instead moved to occupy Friday and Monday nights. Sky, to make up for it, paid for the floodlights the clubs had to install.Given how much soccer is broadcast, more than two decades on, even that is no longer enough. Derry's crowds still drop when the Premier League offers an attractive game on a Monday. Its budget still suffers. Life gets that little bit more difficult.â€œThere's always games on now, that's the problem,â€ Barrett said. â€œWe'll have to start playing on Thursdays.â€"
"KABUL, Afghanistan — Five officials with Afghanistan's soccer federation, including its leader, have been suspended indefinitely after allegations surfaced that some officials had sexually abused female players, Afghan officials said Sunday.Jamshid Rasuli, the spokesman for the attorney general's office, said the suspensions were ordered to prevent â€œviolation of the investigative process,â€ although he did not explain what that meant. Those suspended included the Afghanistan Football Federation president, Keramuddin Keram, three other administrative officials and a coach in charge of goalies.The suspensions came less than a week after the country's president, Ashraf Ghani, ordered a prompt investigation into accusations, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that Mr. Keram, other federation officials and coaches had physically and sexually abused and even raped players on the national women's team. Mr. Ghani called the revelations â€œshocking to all Afghans.â€The other suspended officials included the federation's deputy president, Yosuf Kargar; its general secretary, Sayed Ali Reza Aghazada; a coach in charge of goalies, Abdul Saboor Walizada; and an official in charge of liaison with provincial football teams, Nadir Alimi, according to the attorney general's office.The officials were all suspended without pay unless no charges are brought against them, although they were allowed to continue using their offices â€œbecause we have not received any official letter from attorney general's office yet,â€ said Shafi Shadab, a spokesman for Afghanistan's soccer federation.After the claims of sexual and physical abuse surfaced, FIFA, the world body regulating international soccer, started its own investigation, and the Danish sportswear company Hummel, the principal sponsor of the Afghan women's team, canceled its sponsorship.The accusations were focused on Mr. Keram, who as president of the Afghanistan Football Federation oversees both men's and women's soccer, as well as other male officials from the federation.Khalida Popal, one of the original players on the women's team and a longtime manager, said in a phone interview last week that Mr. Keram and some trainers had been sexually abusing players.Ms. Popal accused Mr. Keram of sexually harassing players in a bedroom in his office which, she said, had been rigged so that it could be opened only from the inside with his fingerprint scan, and that he trapped women there.â€œThe president of A.F.F. and some trainers are raping and sexually harassing female players,â€ she said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.Ms. Popal welcomed the suspension of officials in the football federation, writing in a Twitter post, â€œIf we all stand together and raise our voice and become the #Voice4voiceless no one would be dare to hurt innocents.â€Ms. Popal fled Afghanistan in 2012 and obtained asylum in Denmark but has remained active with the national team.Mina Ahmadi, a former player for the women's team, said in a WhatsApp message: â€œI am really happy and proud that the Afghan justice system is doing the right thing that shows abuse and corruption will no longer be tolerated.â€â€œAll the years these women have suffered and had to keep silent, and now finally their voices were heard,â€ she added. â€œThis step brings hope to everyone that a fundamental change is happening and I think that it is the beginning of a greater future for our country.â€The Afghanistan Football Federation issued a statement on Tuesday calling the allegations â€œgroundlessâ€ and saying it had â€œa zero-tolerance policy toward any type of such behavior.â€ It said no one had ever brought such accusations to its attention.FIFA said it had long been aware of the allegations and was investigating them. â€œFIFA has a zero-tolerance policy on human rights violations and condemns all forms of gender-based violence,â€ the organization said in a statement. â€œThe serious subjects mentioned are being looked into by FIFA.â€Mr. Keram is not a sportsman but is the politically powerful former governor of Panjshir Province and a one-time warlord.Accusations of sexual abuse against male officials running women's teams in Afghanistan are not new. In 2016, the head coach of the women's national cycling team was accused by the team's American founder and many of its members of repeatedly forcing its members to marry him and then divorcing them, as well as other offenses. The coach, Haji Abdul Sediq Seddiqi, was dismissed but never prosecuted."
"The worst-kept secret in American soccer is now official: Gregg Berhalter will be the next coach of the United States men's national team.Berhalter, who will leave the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer after five seasons, was the handpicked choice of the national team's new general manager, Earnie Stewart. But his hiring did not become a done deal until U.S. Soccer's board of directors approved his contract in a conference call. That call took place Saturday, according to a person familiar with the decision.The 45-year-old Berhalter, a former defender who represented the United States on two World Cup teams, is expected to be introduced as the national team coach on Tuesday in New York.His hiring, rumored for months and reported as agreed upon as early as Nov. 23, ends a remarkably slow-moving search that began with the team's World Cup qualifying humiliation in Couva, Trinidad, nearly 14 months ago. In the interregnum, U.S. Soccer endured a bitter campaign to elect a new president, won the rights to co-host the 2026 World Cup and watched the 2018 tournament in Russia from afar.It has also seen the men's team drift through a dozen games under a caretaker coach, Dave Sarachan, while Stewart — hired as general manager in June and on the job only since Aug. 1 — began the long-delayed search for Bruce Arena's permanent replacement.Stewart made few comments on the coaches he was speaking with — his initial working list included almost three dozen names, including some who were suggested to him and others who sought him out to offer their services — and in his rare comments to reporters set a curiously high bar for what he considered a formal interview for the position. But after narrowing the official list twice, Stewart cast his lot with Berhalter, a former teammate.Berhalter's contract is expected to carry him through a four-year World Cup cycle that he, his new players and — most important — the federation hope will end in a redemptive appearance by the United States at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.While the end of the team's leadership vacuum will come as a relief for U.S. Soccer, the plodding pace of the search — a persistent frustration for fans over the past year — was not its finest hour. In recent weeks, the frustration about the team even began to bubble up from inside the locker room. Christian Pulisic, the team's brightest star, strongly hinted after a game in London last month that the team needed some direction after more than a year under Sarachan, a longtime Arena assistant but never a serious candidate for the permanent post.â€œWe definitely want a permanent head coach,â€ Pulisic said, â€œsomeone who has a plan and someone who has a great idea of how we want to play moving forward.â€Berhalter, whose Columbus team was eliminated from the M.L.S. playoffs weeks ago, should hit the ground running. He has kept journals about tactics, but also his personal successes and failures, since his playing days in the Dutch league, and his Columbus teams — short on star power but long on preparation and organization — earned a reputation for punching above their weight in M.L.S.The decision to give him the national team job will do little to appease critics of U.S. Soccer's insider culture (Berhalter's older brother Jay is U.S. Soccer's chief commercial officer) or its outreach efforts to the country's large Hispanic soccer community, which has often felt its contributions — and its players — have been marginalized by the federation.But Berhalter's credentials appealed to the one person who mattered most: Stewart. Berhalter represented clubs in the Netherlands, England and Germany during a long playing career, and made more than 40 appearances for the United States senior team — including two starts in the knockout stage of the 2002 World Cup. He earned his coaching licenses while playing in Europe and cut his teeth in an 18-month stint leading Hammarby in Sweden. Fired for fielding teams that were deemed â€œtoo defensive,â€ he returned to M.L.S. — where he had won a league title as a player, under Arena in Los Angeles — to lead Columbus to the playoffs in four of his five seasons in charge.Berhalter's first look at the United States team will come in its annual January training camp, which most likely will take place without most of the squad's European pros. (The January dates are not on the official FIFA calendar, meaning clubs are not required to release their players for them.) That camp will be more than 16 months after the team's stunning loss to Trinidad and Tobago in World Cup qualifying shook U.S. Soccer to its core.The 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle is expected to begin next fall. By then, U.S. Soccer hopes, Berhalter and his players will be positioned at last to try to return the country to soccer's biggest stage."
"We are cruising along the highway in the dusky hour, the Uncompahgre River winding below us. It is October in Colorado, and the blazing yellow cottonwoods seem lit from within. Scrub patchwork the hillsides in rust. It is breathtaking and heartbreaking, a reminder of the way we all strive to shine, and will all ultimately die.This is what I'm thinking when my husband, Dan, in the passenger seat, calls out, â€œDeer!â€This deer is not poised to dart onto the highway but is already lifeless on the shoulder. It wasn't there when we passed this spot two hours ago on our way to our son's weekend soccer tournament. This points to one thing: the possibility of fresh meat.We are a hunting family and have never turned away the gift of wild meat, no matter the packaging. I turn the Subaru around in the gathering dark and Dan jumps out to perform the edibility checklist (Eyes glassy; body still warm; not mangled). I text our friends: We'll be late for dinner.We heave the awkward mass of the mule deer into the back of our Subaru. Her feathery, black eyelashes are speckled with dust. We push against her bulk, which contorts to fit the small space. I tuck her dirt-caked hooves under her. A trickle of blood escapes her mouth.Our 13-year-old son, Col, is riding separately with soccer buddies, but our 11-year-old daughter, Rosie, is in the back seat with her friend, coincidentally named Fawn. Rosie has been protesting since Dan first uttered the words that put this roadkill project in motion. â€œDaddy, it's gonna smell the car up. And get blood everywhere. Please, just let it go this time.â€ Something larger than blood stains is at stake.Something like fitting in, being liked and passing in the ever-changing adolescent theater of normalcy. The fact that Rosie has assisted in meat-processing since she was 2, bellying up to the butcher table in princess tulle, is irrelevant here. It doesn't matter that when we were still home schooling, Col and Rosie made artistic roadkill badges, taking to the rural highways with Dan, looking for opportunity. Gutting an animal was a science lesson, both kids gaping at the gumdrop-shaped heart, the rubbery trachea that once shuttled breath from outside to inside. And without ambivalence they devour any wild meat — squirrel, grouse, elk, deer, bear, European dove — no matter the route it traveled to our kitchen.These days, Rosie is an air traffic controller scanning for cultural norms. Fitting in confers a coveted safety, a life raft to which she clings, knowing that those who are different stand out like capsizing ships.Like me and Dan. I don't shave my legs or wear makeup. We live in an 800-square-foot house and our two cars combined are 47 years old. Neither of us have smartphones, making the question â€œHow old should you be before getting a smartphone?â€ particularly discouraging for our kids.We've made it a practice to want less, valuing time and simplicity. Meanwhile, every week there's something new that Rosie needs, something that in my quest for simplicity, frugality and a modicum of environmental sustainability is mystifying. Three different pairs of sneakers? â€œYes, Mom,â€ she sighs, knowing what she's up against. â€œOne for hiking, one for P.E., and one for everyday school.â€The deer, though lifeless, maintains a large presence in the car. Rosie is furious. â€œYour hands are bloody. Our car smells disgusting.â€ To me, the doe smells like dusty hide and cold nighttime earth. We ask Fawn how it is for her. â€œWell,â€ she cranks up her small voice, â€œthere's this dead deer behind me and its tongue is hanging out. So, that's kind of weird.â€Dan drops us at the restaurant and heads into the night to find a place in this unknown town three hours and two mountain passes from our home in Durango, Colo., to gut the deer, crucial for cooling off the body before we butcher her tomorrow.The gutting goes flawlessly; dinner is wild and raucous, kids outnumbering adults and engineering complex trades for French fries. At 9 p.m. we pull up to our suburban basement Airbnb, leaving the doe in the car, windows down. Dan has removed the meaty prize of the heart, which we slip into our cooler.The next morning we wake, feed children, and leave them in front of dual TVs, Rose and Fawn watching Barbie cartoons while brushing their hair as if it's a sport. We find a secluded pull out along the river and heft the doe onto the grass. I slosh the back of the Subaru with river water, rinsing blood from the rubber mat while Dan removes her luxurious hide for later tanning. â€œThank you, beautiful girl,â€ I say, admiring her perfect floppy-eared deer-ness. We whittle meat from bone as the sun lights the candles of cottonwood crowns. The cooler fills with zip-locked bags containing flawless chunks of the choicest meat. Something about this work — directly engaging with the source of our food, taking her wild life into ours — counteracts what I find challenging about these soccer tournaments: the investment of time and resources, and the packaging of our children's wildness into the conventionality of sport rather than the unstructured adventures that once filled our weekends.We stash the blood-flecked bones in the willows for wild creatures, gather up the children and head to the soccer field. Rosie begs to visit a nearby Target. We don't have one in our town and she's never been. The other soccer moms have already shopped and are joking about telling their husbands how much they saved, not what they spent.To our daughter, shopping there seems like an American rite of passage. The promise of a hit of pleasure glows as bright as the store's iconic red bull's-eye.â€œSo you can buy some shiny trinket that loses its appeal one day later?â€ Dan wonders.Rosie sighs.When the kids were younger it was easy to broadcast our lifestyle on the singular station of our family. Now, outside influences grow louder. While I feel celebration in living my values, for the kids it can feel like deprivation. And I yield, I do. Rosie owns three pairs of sneakers (beaters for hiking; athletic for P.E. and turquoise Converses for school). I bought liquid soap for our bathroom so her friends â€œwill feel more comfortable,â€ despite the large, lovely batches of deer tallow soap we've made. I'm wary about creating a wall of rigidity against which the kids will necessarily rebel, and equally wary of giving into strategies that temporarily fill their loneliness, boredom and cravings to fit in.I give the girls $10 each and drop them at Target. They simmer in excitement. My hope is that in tasting the full flavors of consumerism — its joy and heartache — Rosie will eventually find her own wisdom. I've delighted in her self-made sparkle since she was 2, perched on a chair mixing spices into raw, ground elk in plastic princess heels, her shoulders dripping with purses. Her flair is as authentic as my practicality.Thirty minutes later the girls tumble out of the store with cucumber-scented face wipes, gum and mild euphoria. Col's team gets spectacularly crushed. We drive home over mountain passes coated with snow. The following night soccer practice is canceled. The four of us gather for dinner — deer heart fajitas — savoring the wild and complex flavors of this life.Rachel Turiel is a freelance writer living in Durango, Colo., and working on a memoir."
"U.S. Soccer took 14 months to pick a new men's national team coach, but Earnie Stewart knew whom he wanted even before he placed a phone call to the man who would eventually get the job.After starting in his new post as national team general manager on Aug. 1, Stewart began making calls — to coaches, sporting directors and respected former United States players — to solicit their advice in creating a literal bullet-pointed list of the qualities required in the new coach. The final profile included rÃ©sumÃ© basics like coaching licenses and top-flight experience; management-speak qualities like â€œopen-minded and innovativeâ€ and â€œexcellent communication skillsâ€; and curiously specific ones, like an openness and understanding of data analytics and a â€œcalm and confident sideline demeanor.â€Stewart's list of candidates — more than 30 at first — was scored against the profile and then cut to about a dozen. And then, in late August, he picked up the phone.â€œHe called me on my cellphone,â€ said Gregg Berhalter, who was introduced as the national team's new coach on Tuesday in New York. Stewart, Berhalter said, began with a simple question: â€œWhat do you think about discussing this?â€The final stages of the coaching search, which began after the team's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and was by then nearly a year old, progressed quickly from there. Berhalter, a teammate of Stewart's on the 2002 World Cup team, met with Stewart for more substantive conversations in Columbus, Ohio — where Berhalter coached the Columbus Crew of M.L.S. — and in Chicago, where U.S. Soccer is based. In October, Berhalter flew to Miami, where he gave a four-hour presentation on his vision for the team to U.S. Soccer's president, Carlos Cordeiro, and its chief executive, Dan Flynn.In persuading them and Stewart that he was the man for the job, Berhalter said he also quelled his own doubts.Berhalter had heard the speculation that he might be a candidate, he said, â€œbut you never really think it's going to come, to know that this could be a potential opportunity.â€He added, â€œWhen I got that call, it's still very exciting.â€As he went through his interviews, he said, he decided, â€œI'm ready for this.â€In the end, the process to fill the position took 14 months, delayed first by the aftermath of the World Cup fail — which prompted a contentious fight for the U.S. Soccer presidency — and then by the federation's laser-focused (and ultimately successful) effort to bring the 2026 World Cup to North America.As the search dragged on, though, other coaching moves and U.S. Soccer disinterest ruled out one potential candidate after another. The former Red Bulls coach Jesse Marsch, another former teammate of Stewart's, accepted an assistant's job in Germany, and the former Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio — who had expressed strong interest in the United States job in an interview with The New York Times before the World Cup — was by August deep into negotiations to become Paraguay's coach.But there were others in the mix — and then out of it — as well: M.L.S. coaches like Tata Martino, Peter Vermes and Oscar Pareja; U.S. Soccer insiders like Tab Ramos and the interim coach who had run the team during the search, Dave Sarachan; and coaches with international pedigrees, like Osorio and Julien Lopetegui, the former Spain and Real Madrid coach, who reportedly tossed his hat in the ring last month only to be told he was too late.Stewart acknowledged Tuesday that one of the three candidates he identified for a formal interview never got the chance for a hearing — â€œHe had already made a different choiceâ€ — but he dismissed missing out on potential candidates as secondary to landing the one he considered the right fit.Cordeiro praised the process — widely derided as ponderously slow by frustrated American fans — as thorough and as fulfilling a pledge he had made in his presidential campaign to ensure â€œsoccer operations are run by soccer experts.â€â€œWe have no regrets, at all,â€ Cordeiro said of the length of the search. â€œWe got our best guy.â€â€œWe haven't sacrificed our candidates to any deadline,â€ he added, â€œbecause we didn't have a deadline.â€By October, about the time Cordeiro and Flynn were meeting Berhalter in Miami, his hiring began to look like a foregone conclusion. Stewart said Tuesday that he interviewed only two candidates — Yahoo Sports reported Pareja, a Colombian who had won wide praise for his development of young players in Dallas, was the other — before picking Berhalter.U.S. Soccer's board of directors approved Berhalter's hiring in a conference call on Saturday.Berhalter's first training camp will be in early January, though it will probably take place without many of the team's top players, whose European clubs are under no obligation to release them that week. U.S. Soccer announced Tuesday that Berhalter's first game would be an exhibition against Panama on Jan. 27 in Glendale, Ariz. The team will face Costa Rica in San Jose, Calif., six days later.Until then, Berhalter, accustomed to the week-to-week access to players a club coach has, will transition to the more detached existence that international coaches use to keep tabs on their players.He said he would try to meet with as many players as he could before they arrived in camp, starting with those in M.L.S., and then head to Europe for one-on-one sessions with those playing abroad. He vowed to create a team whose identity would be built around initiative, an attacking unit that would â€œdisorganizeâ€ opponents through pressure and ball circulation.â€œThe head's already going,â€ Berhalter said. â€œI'm already thinking of what we're going to do.â€"
"RIO DE JANEIRO — Fire consumed a dormitory early Friday at a Brazilian training center for teenage soccer players run by one of South America's most prominent teams, killing at least 10 in a disaster that reverberated through the soccer world and beyond.The fire in the dormitory, which may have been constructed improperly on what was intended to be a parking lot, was the latest in a string of seemingly preventable tragedies that have convulsed Brazil over the past two weeks.It struck the training center of the Flamengo club in Rio de Janeiro, breaking out in the early morning when many youth players, ages 14 to 17, were asleep. Three others were injured, one seriously, and were taken to a hospital.Officials would not confirm the identities of the dead. But Globoesporte, a Brazilian sports news website, said all were players. The dorm housed 26 players and 13 escaped unharmed, the website said.â€œThe location was completely consumed in flames,â€ Douglas Henaut, a lieutenant with firefighters, told journalists at the scene. â€œUnfortunately, we weren't able to rescue anyone inside. As much as we tried to enter and locate the victims, it wasn't possible. The bodies were found totally charred.â€Flamengo is one of Brazil's most popular soccer clubs and is considered a symbol of the country's global dominance in the training and development of young athletes who aspire to join professional soccer.Some of Brazil's biggest stars have played with Flamengo, among them RomÃ¡rio, Ronaldinho and Zico, who represented the country in World Cups, and many others who have played for high-profile teams abroad.The club's training center, known as Ninho do Urubu, or Vulture's Nest, in the western part of the city, had recently undergone renovations. Rio officials confirmed local news reports that the dormitory had been erected in what was supposed to be a parking lot, with no permits for construction, and was going to be torn down after the occupants moved into a new dorm.â€œThe fire was in my room,â€ Felipe Cardoso, 15, who plays for the Flamengo youth team, wrote on Twitter. â€œI have only God to thank for managing to wake up and escape death, may God comfort my brothers.â€For players accepted to the youth team, it was the Brazilian equivalent of joining the Dallas Cowboys. A video posted by a team member who was away when the fire erupted showed their exuberant camaraderie in the dorm.President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who is hospitalized after intestinal surgery, posted a condolence message on social media: â€œThis morning we were made aware of the sad tragedy in the Flamengo training center, taking the young lives of those who were beginning the path toward the realization of their professional dreams.â€Firefighters said they were alerted to the blaze at 5:17 a.m. local time, and Rio de Janeiro prosecutors said they had created a task force to investigate the cause.The fire comes two weeks after a dam broke in the most lethal mining disaster in Brazil's history, and just two days after a powerful summer storm in Rio de Janeiro set off flooding and mudslides, killing six.The disasters have shocked and saddened Brazilians and have highlighted the country's shoddy infrastructure and poor emergency response.â€œWe are seeing a succession of avoidable, preventable facts and disasters, and we must pay attention to them so that the institutions of control, enforcement and punishment really work in Brazil,â€ the country's prosecutor general, Raquel Dodge, said in BrasÃ­lia, the capital, after news of the fire spread.The blaze also focused attention on living conditions for young Brazilian soccer players, many of whom come from underprivileged backgrounds and live in dormitories like Flamengo's across the vast country.â€œIt's hard to imagine what Flamengo means for these boys,â€ said Juca Kfouri, a Brazilian sports columnist and author. â€œIn Brazil, there are only two legal paths to social improvement for them: entertainment and soccer. Otherwise it's a life of crime.â€Mr. Kfouri said he was not familiar with the dormitory at the Flamengo training ground, but he said that living conditions at soccer clubs in Brazil historically were atrocious — including a case in which boys were housed in one dormitory built underneath the stands and another infested with rats.â€œTraining at Flamengo is realizing your life's goal,â€ Mr. Kfouri said. â€œBut now it's a dream turned into a nightmare.â€He added that the death toll in the fire was most likely lower than it could have been because training had been suspended after the widespread flooding in Rio, and some boys had gone home.Zico, one of Brazil's soccer legends, sent reporters a video lamenting the tragedy. He said he had met some of the boys who died in the fire. â€œWe ended up getting close to them,â€ he said. â€œBoys with dreams, goals, a lot of them trying to help their families.â€Rival clubs expressed sympathy on social media. The messages included one from Chapecoense, which suffered its own tragedy just over two years ago when a plane carrying team members to an international competition ran out of fuel and crashed, killing nearly all of the 77 people on board.One of soccer's most recent breakout stars, the Real Madrid forward VinÃ­cius JÃºnior, who was developed in Flamengo's youth ranks and lived at the academy, took to Twitter to express his horror at the fire. He wrote that he was in shock and called for prayers.While Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, is known for its exports of meat, metal and coffee, nothing garners as much attention as the soccer players it dispatches at a rate unmatched anywhere.Brazilian players form the backbone of soccer's $7 billion player trading industry. Last year alone 832 players left on overseas adventures, according to data provided by soccer's global governing body, FIFA.While a few, like the star forward Neymar, will make it to the biggest stages of the game, most are soccer's workhorses, providing a Brazilian touch to professional teams from East Timor to the Faroe Islands looking to fill their rosters with reliable, well-coached and relatively inexpensive talent.Back home in Brazil, rampant inequality and a lack of other opportunities mean, the supply of young, gifted soccer players looking for a way out of grinding poverty is almost limitless.Flamengo's newly renovated facility opened late last year, at a cost of about $6 million, and was part of a complete overhaul of the club's youth development system.Besides five training fields, a swimming pool and gym facilities, the complex was to contain accommodations for 48 players to live on site: 36 single bedrooms, and six doubles.Occupants of the dorm that burned had been scheduled to move into a new building next month, according to local news media reports.Flamengo also had engaged Double Pass, a Belgian consulting firm that specializes in soccer youth development, to modernize the way it trained players.Alexandre Wrobel, a vice president at the club, has been quoted by Brazilian media as saying the youth training facility it would be among the top five in soccer.Such modern surroundings remain comparatively rare in South America, where many clubs cannot call on the lucrative television deals and sponsorship arrangements that bankroll teams in Europe."
"MEXICO CITY — Marbella Ibarra, a coach who pioneered the development of women's soccer in Mexico, was found beaten to death this week, a month after she went missing from her home in the border city of Tijuana.From her start as a star forward at the Autonomous University of Baja California, Ms. Ibarra dedicated her career to training female players. She was the driving force behind Mexico's first professional women's team, persuading Club Tijuana to form a female squad four years ago.Ms. Ibarra, who was 46, was buried on Thursday. Her body, covered with a blanket, was discovered Sunday in Rosarito, a resort town to the south of Tijuana. Her hands and feet had been tied, and she had been brutally beaten around the face and neck, said JosÃ© Manuel YÃ©piz, a spokesman for the Baja California state attorney general's office, on Thursday.Mr. YÃ©piz said that Ms. Ibarra's family had reported her missing on Sept. 18. He said that investigators had not established the circumstances of her disappearance or a motive for her killing, but he added that her sports career was not believed to be related to her murder.News of Ms. Ibarra's death prompted an outpouring of grief from players she had mentored, some of whom had gone on to play in Mexico's two-year-old professional women's league, known as the Liga MX Feminil.â€œYou were, are and will be the best coach I ever had,â€ wrote Carolina Jaramillo, a forward on the Tigres UANL team and a member of Mexico's national team, on Twitter. â€œRest in peace, I love you Mar.â€â€œSave a little piece of heaven for me,â€ wrote Inglis Hernandez, a midfielder on the Tijuana women's team Ms. Ibarra helped found. â€œSome day we'll lift this cup again together.â€Rafael GonzÃ¡lez MartÃ­nez, the sports editor at Zeta, a weekly newspaper in Tijuana, said Ms. Ibarra was known for her dedication to her players.â€œShe was always somebody who wanted to help those who had less,â€ he said. â€œShe was always attentive, always supportive — with lunch, uniforms, cleats, balls. She was very passionate for her sport.â€Ms. Ibarra first drew attention as a player on her college team in Tijuana, Mr. GonzÃ¡lez said. She studied law, and after graduating, she stayed at the university as an assistant coach and then moved up to head coach.She founded her own amateur team, Isamar FC, named after her family-owned beauty salon, which sponsored the team. It was there that she began to form a squad of young players, who caught the attention of the coach of the national under-20 team.But she had her sights set on creating a professional league. In 2014, she persuaded the Club Tijuana men's team, the Xoloitzcuintles, to establish a professional women's team, known as Las Xolos.Coached by Ms. Ibarra, the Xolos played for one year with the Women's Premier Soccer League in the United States. She continued to coach the Xolos until last year, when she left the team just as the Mexican Federation created the Liga MX Feminil.After that, Ms. Ibarra dedicated her time to her foundation, Ellas Juegan, or â€œThe Girls Play,â€ which provides support for young women players."
"BUENOS AIRES — Lionel Messi is going to the circus.Messi, the Argentine who has been described as the best soccer player in the world, has profited handsomely by promoting everything from soft drinks, clothing brands, cellphones and a Russian bank. He even has lent his name to a theme park that is scheduled to open in Nanjing, China in 2020.But fans were left scratching their heads on Tuesday when Messi posted a video on his Instagram account kicking a clown's nose while wearing a Cirque du Soleil T-shirt.Turns out the French Canadian entertainment behemoth is producing one of the company's signature acrobatic shows based on Messi's life.â€œI am honored to announce my partnership with @CirqueduSoleil for the creation of a brand-new show in 2019 based on my life and the passion for Football,â€ Messi wrote on Instagram on Wednesday morning.There were few details on how the company will depict the story of Messi, and his rise from a boy from Rosario, Argentina, who overcame a growth-hormone deficiency to a star at Spain's F.C. Barcelona — and perhaps the best player in soccer history.In a statement, Cirque du Soleil said the show would â€œdraw its inspiration from the incredible talent and accomplishments of the football legend.â€The show's international tour is set to begin in 2019, although cities and dates have yet to be announced.â€œIt feels both crazy and incredible that Cirque du Soleil will create a show based on my life, my passion, my sport,â€ Messi said in a statement, calling himself a fan of company's shows, which blend gravity-defying acrobatic stunts with dramatic story lines.The show will be Cirque du Soleil's first foray into soccer. It previously teamed up with the N.F.L. to create an immersive fan experience in Times Square.â€œWe are convinced that bringing Messi's legacy to life on stage will touch audiences and speak to all football fans,â€ said Jonathan TÃ©trault, Cirque du Soleil's president.By delving into the world of soccer, Cirque du Soleil most likely is hoping to tap into an audience that might not otherwise go to one of the 20 shows the company is staging around the world, including tributes to the Beatles and Michael Jackson."
"EUPEN, Belgium — The chant started midway through the first half, emanating from a corner of the Kehrweg Stadium where a few dozen preteens, each of them wearing a thick down jacket amid the falling snow, were gathered.Their coats identified the children as members of the youth system of the local club, K.A.S. Eupen. The team's crest was emblazoned on the chest of each coat. On the back was another badge, another name: Aspire, the organization that owns and runs Eupen. For five years, Eupen has been the finishing school for graduates of the Aspire Academy, the lavish Qatari-financed project designed to turn the tiny Gulf state into an elite force in global sports.The children were clearly eager to show their gratitude on Monday when Qatar's national team paid a rare visit to Eupen to face Iceland in an exhibition match. As Ari Skulason, the Icelandic captain, lined up a free kick, that small corner of the stadium came out in support of his opponent. In shrill, excited voices, carrying across the bitterly cold night, the Belgian children chanted, â€œQatar, Qatar.â€In the last decade, Qatar has spent an almost unfathomable amount of money to try to turn itself into a major player in soccer and, by extension, to win hearts and minds, to accrue coveted soft power around the globe. Here, at least, in this neat, compact stadium in this neat, compact town a few miles from the Belgium-Germany border, it seems to be working.Eupen itself accounts for only the tiniest sliver of Qatar's multibillion-dollar investment. Far more has gone into Aspire, with its expert, imported staff and its state-of-the-art facilities in Doha and Senegal.Even that, though, pales into insignificance when compared with Qatar's sponsorship deals with Barcelona, the establishment and expansion of the broadcaster beIN Sports, or the billion or so dollars spent on the purchase and subsequent transformation of Paris St.-Germain into one of Europe's most powerful and most glamorous clubs.And then, of course, there is the 2022 World Cup. Wednesday is four years to the day until the greatest show on Earth descends on Qatar, a nation of just 2.6 million people, a country that has never qualified for the tournament on merit, a place that has had to build a soccer infrastructure, essentially, from scratch. It is thought the eventual bill for the stadiums, the transportation systems, the hotels and at least one whole city will reach $200 billion.That is the price; it is not the whole cost. It has been eight years since the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter confirmed, in front of a stunned conference hall in Zurich, that Qatar had beaten the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia to win the rights to the 2022 tournament. What has happened since must surely cause both FIFA and Qatar itself the occasional quiver of doubt as to whether it was worth it.For years, allegations of corruption, bribery and fraud in the bidding process swirled. Few of the members of the FIFA Executive Committee who were party to the vote remain; many have been indicted or arrested. The scandal eventually brought down Blatter and his entire regime. FIFA does what it can to claim that it has changed, but its case is unconvincing. The stain remains. In truth, it may never wash out.Nor has the spotlight on Qatar been kind. If hosting the World Cup was imagined as a way to convey the country's strength to the world, it has done little to that end. Human rights groups continue to report grave abuses of migrant workers in Qatar, frequently on projects related to the World Cup.That is not to cast FIFA, or Qatar, as victims. The victims are the workers themselves, the ones who are living in appalling conditions, who are paid barely enough to survive, and who continue to die in the searing desert heat — written off as collateral damage in a power game, the cost of Qatar's obsession with soccer.Or, rather, its obsession with the tool that it hopes soccer can be. It has long seemed as if it is the theater of the World Cup — the display of wealth, the conspicuous consumption — that appeals to Qatar. The sport itself has always seemed something of an afterthought, what happened on the field somehow less important than the beauty of the stadiums.That is not to say there is no thought that has gone into the team — Aspire works hand-in-glove with Qatar's soccer federation — or that there is no plan to ensure that Qatar is, at the very least, competitive. It is simply that the incremental, low-key buildup is at odds with the glitz and showmanship Qatar has tried to project elsewhere, on the building sites in Doha or in Paris.Monday's game against Iceland, in front of only 2,830 fans here in Eupen — quite a few of them wearing Aspire jackets — is a case in point. Qatar is choosing its opponents carefully, avoiding the temptation to play the game's giants. There would be little educational benefit for its players, entirely based in the Qatari Stars League, from being picked apart by France or Brazil.Instead, Qatar's Spanish coach, FÃ©lix SÃ¡nchez Bas, and his players take on the likes of Iceland and Switzerland. These are teams that can teach the squad â€œwhat it is to play at a high level, how quickly mistakes are punished,â€ as SÃ¡nchez Bas said; teams that â€œwere at the World Cup, that are some of the best in the world or the best in Europe,â€ according to winger Akram Afif, one of Qatar's brightest talents.The idea is that the Qataris can learn gradually, carefully and without intense pressure what they will need to do if they are to exceed the world's (admittedly low) expectations in 2022. â€œThe World Cup is the long-term objective,â€ SÃ¡nchez Bas said. â€œWe know it is there.â€He prefers to focus on the short term: the Asian Cup this winter, followed by a guest spot at the Copa AmÃ©rica next summer in Brazil. â€œIt is all experience for 2022,â€ he said.The results, over the last few days, have been encouraging: a win against Switzerland followed by a commendable draw with a slightly weakened Iceland. â€œThey have improved a lot,â€ said Erik Hamren, Iceland's Swedish coach. â€œAnd they still have four years, and a lot of resources, to take more steps.â€Four years is a long time, of course: It is dozens more friendlies, each one a little more exacting than the last. It is countless training sessions. â€œWe have every day to work, 24 hours every day,â€ Afif said.But it is also not that long. Qatar is two-thirds of the way through its World Cup project. It is tempting to wonder if that is why so much effort has gone into the stadiums, because that is the part Qatar could indisputably control. Building a team is not something that can be done to deadline, no matter how much money is available.In a country with such a small pool of players, as Afif said, it is likely that the team that took the field against Iceland will remain at least partly in place for the tournament. â€œIt is hard to find players of a high level,â€ he said. â€œThat is the difference between Qatar and places like Spain.â€Like his coach, Afif does not see the World Cup as an immediate worry. There is no pressure on the players because of 2022, he said, no sense of urgency or panic. The clock, though, is ticking. Four years from now, all of the money Qatar has spent, all of the players it has bought for P.S.G. and all the stadiums it has built, all of the hearts and minds it has tried to win, will be forgotten. In the eyes of the world, the success or failure of its grand ambition will rest on 23 players and a coach. Four years from now, the game will start."
"DORTMUND, Germany — There are times these days when Marco Reus finds himself in the middle of the field at Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park, watching as Jadon Sancho and Jacob Bruun Larsen and Achraf Hakimi tear around him, a blur of yellow and black, and remembering what it was like to be young.Not that Reus is what most of us would call old; he is not quite what his peers would call old, either. That is how he feels, though. â€œI am old, my friend,â€ he said. â€œIn our business, now, when you are 29 or 30, you are old.â€ He delivers it with a smile, an acknowledgment that he is hamming it up, just a little, but the sentiment is real.Reus feels old in the sense that he is starkly aware that he is no longer young. He knows that whenever he sees Sancho, Larsen and the rest of Dortmund's shooting stars, the way they play with boldness and fearlessness. They look to him like â€œyoung horses,â€ wild and free.Reus knows that feeling well, that glorious weightlessness, unencumbered by thoughts of â€œwhat will happen later, what happens after you finish,â€ the end so distant that you cannot believe it will ever come.He was like that once, when he was one of the standard-bearers of the new German generation that was going to lift the World Cup in 2014, a winger of pace and cunning and dead-eyed finishing, first with Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach and then as part — a key part — of JÃ¼rgen Klopp's Dortmund team.He remembers it well enough to know that he no longer has it, that it has disappeared at some point along the way. And yet it is hard to conceive of Reus as a â€œveteran,â€ as he puts it. Partly, that is because he does not really look the part. His hair is a little darker than it used to be, no longer colored a bright blond, but his face is still smooth-skinned, and his voice is still soft, boyish. He hardly fits the stereotype of the grizzled, wizened pro.And partly it is because it feels as if Reus, even on the cusp of his 30th birthday, is still somehow a talent-in-waiting, his potential not yet fully tapped. For a player regarded as one of Europe's best for much of the last decade, he has an air of one of the sport's lost boys.When Dortmund re-signed Reus — he was released from its youth system as a teenager — after its last Bundesliga title, in 2012, he was supposed to be the player who lifted the club to the next level.Klopp believed Reus represented a scarcely believable bargain — â€œhis real market value is much higherâ€ than the nearly $20 million he cost, he said — while the Dortmund chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, felt Reus might be able to â€œdefine an eraâ€ for the club, in the way that â€œUwe Seeler did at Hamburg and Steven Gerrard at Liverpool.â€Franz Beckenbauer identified him, along with Mario GÃ¶tze, as Germany's brightest hopes. The two helped Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final; Reus was penciled in as a starter in Joachim LÃ¶w's Germany team for the 2014 World Cup.And then, 10 hours before Germany was scheduled to travel to Brazil, Reus tore his ankle ligaments in his final pretournament friendly. He punched the ground in frustration. Germany's team flew without him. It came home a month later as the world champion.Reus did his rehab, returned to fitness, seemed ready to break through into the elite once more. Before the European Championship in 2016, LÃ¶w said that Reus â€œhugely enrichedâ€ the Germany side. But he missed that tournament through injury, too (Germany reached the semifinals).Another recovery, another fresh start. In 2017, EA Sports made him the cover star of that year's edition of its FIFA game, an honor usually afforded to Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo; that was the sort of company Reus was expected to keep. Dortmund made the German Cup final that year. Reus, after so many delays, had the first silverware of his career in his grasp.He picked up an injury in the first half. At halftime, Dortmund's doctors informed him that they believed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament, and that he would be sidelined for six months, eight months, maybe more. He called his parents, and his girlfriend, Scarlett, and cried. â€œIt's bad,â€ he told them. Dortmund went on to win.That evening, Reus stopped to talk to reporters. They asked him if he knew the extent of the injury. â€œIt is just a little cruciate,â€ he told them. Dortmund's communications team was baffled. There is, they knew, and Reus knew, no such thing as a little cruciate injury.â€œNegative experiences teach you what to say,â€ Reus said, explaining how he could be so relaxed. It was not, though, an act of bravado. He had suffered injuries before, setbacks bad enough that he had once said he would happily trade all of the money he had made during his career for his fitness.This injury was the worst of all of them, and yet it had, he said, â€œcaused something in my head to accept it.â€ That is not to say he did not suffer. In the hospital, a couple of days later, â€œonce the adrenaline had worn off,â€ Reus felt that familiar bleakness setting in. He still had times when he â€œgot emotional, angry, screamed, cried,â€ but he knew that he had to get it out, get over it, get on with it.â€œIf it stays inside, you get sad, and you never get to the point where you can make the next step,â€ he said. â€œYou can be sad for a couple of days, and nobody will be angry with you. But for weeks and months? It does not help.â€He did not, though — not then, not during any of his injuries, not during any of the time that he lost — start to feel he was cursed. He never asked why this was happening to him, why he had so much snatched away from him, why fate seemed arranged that he would remain a what if, one of those players who never quite becomes — through no fault of his own — what he was supposed to be.â€œIt is human to think about what I have missed,â€ he said. â€œBut if I regret too much, think about what I have lost, I lose focus on what I need to do. You cannot rewind. This is not a computer game that you can play again. All I can do is try to be better, to be luckier, next time.â€That is not the only change in perspective injury has afforded him. â€œYou have a lot of time to think about other things, too,â€ he said. Over the eight months of his rehabilitation, Reus — by his own estimation — grew up. â€œYou become aware of what you are doing, and what comes next, and when that will start,â€ he said.He turns 30 in May. By that stage, if all goes well, he will have become a father for the first time. He is no longer young, even if he is not quite old. â€œI have three or four years left,â€ he said of his playing career. â€œThat is still quite a period, but football goes fast.â€He has made no firm decisions on what he will do when his career ends — he would prefer not to go into senior management, but coach children, if he stays in soccer, because that is when â€œyou should be having the most funâ€ — though he has a few ideas. He has not forgotten what it is to be footloose, carefree, but that does not mean he envies Sancho, Larsen and his other young teammates. He does not resent the clock for ticking.â€œThe injuries have taught me to enjoy the time I have on the field, the time I am training with the guys,â€ he said. â€œAs you get older, you learn it will end at some point, and so you cherish the moments you are healthy.â€ Those young horses are lucky, he knows, to feel it will never end. But he would not trade places with them. When you know that time is limited, and time is precious, you appreciate it all the more."
"STRASBOURG, France — When France won soccer's World Cup in July, millions of fans crowded the streets and cheered as star players like Paul Pogba and Kylian MbappÃ© were honored at the presidential palace. As in 1998, when a similarly multicultural team delivered France's first world title, commentators quickly hailed the triumph of a â€œnewâ€ and more united France, one that would become more open to diversity, at least in sports.But Kerfalla Sissoko had more troubling thoughts on his mind.A month before the World Cup, Sissoko, 25, an amateur soccer player from Guinea, had been brutally attacked after a fight broke out during a league match near the northeastern city of Strasbourg. Sissoko and several black teammates said later that rival players and fans had directed racist insults at them during the game, but the spark of the brawl hardly mattered to him as he ran for his life. Cornered as he tried to leave the field, Sissoko was threatened by rival supporters — including one holding a knife — and beaten by players and fans, who broke his cheekbone.Then league officials suspended him for 10 games for provoking the melee.â€œI was so afraid and so disgusted, that I felt like I would never play soccer again,â€ Sissoko said.What happened to Sissoko in May, far from the glittering Stade de France, where the many black players on the French national team recently celebrated its triumph and where it will face Germany on Tuesday, has shined a light on the racism and discrimination that still mar French soccer at the amateur level, critics say. A survey of 300 amateur sports clubs published in March by the antiracism organization Licra highlighted 74 cases of racism, but the study's authors acknowledged that the problem had become so common that episodes are often not reported.Incidents that do make the news — the attack on Sissoko and his teammates; an assault on three black players outside a nightclub in Corsica in September; another case of racial insults from supporters in May 2017, in St.-Pierre d'OlÃ©ron, in western France — show that it remains a national issue.Racism in soccer is not only a French problem. Racist insults against black players are still routine in many European leagues. In Germany, the federation has tried to contain accusations of discrimination after Mesut Ozil, who is of Turkish origin, resigned from the national team this summer, saying, â€œI am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.â€But in France, the victory at the World Cup by a multicultural team of Frenchmen — white, black, Muslim — has failed to persuade many anti-discrimination advocates that longstanding and deeply contentious issues like race and nationality have been resolved.â€œIt's very complicated to bring up the issue of racism in the French society, because in France we pretend to be blind to colors,â€ said Lilian Thuram, a defender on France's 1998 World Cup championship team who has closely followed Sissoko's case.Critics like Thuram argue that while France's national and professional teams have made progress in preventing or punishing racism in soccer, local authorities often refuse to recognize the problem or deal with it effectively when problems arise. Officials from the local league in which Sissoko's assault occurred, for example, rejected not only the racial abuse claims of Sissoko and his teammates but also the premise that the violence had been motivated by race at all.William Gasparini, a sociology professor at the University of Strasbourg who studies discrimination and sports, said there was a big gap between the ways race is handled at the professional level and in the lower levels of amateur soccer.â€œProfessional clubs or national teams may now be more aware of racism issues than in the past, but that is the stage, the visible part,â€ he said.He added, referring to a mafia-style code of silence, â€œIn amateur soccer throughout France, there is an omertÃ : Clubs are more reluctant to address racism or discrimination.â€For Thuram, that can be explained by a lack of diversity: The boards of most of France's soccer institutions, he said, are still populated largely by white men. Four of the 14 members of the French soccer federation's executive committee are women, and only one member is nonwhite. Its amateur equivalent, an association that oversees hundreds of clubs and dozens of leagues across the country, is governed by a board on which all 12 members are white.Sissoko was assaulted during the first half of a game in Mackenheim, a village of 800 residents. Sissoko and two of his black A.S. Benfeld teammates said that several Mackenheim supporters and players had targeted them with racial slurs.As the match grew more tense shortly before halftime, a disagreement on the field turned into a fight. Mackenheim players assaulted the black players, according to spectators and Sissoko's teammates. Moudi Laouali, 27, a Benfeld player from Niger, was punched in the face and was later beaten as he lay on the field.When Sissoko tried to reach the relative safety of the locker room, he said, Mackenheim fans who had invaded the field blocked his way. He said one of them, holding a kitchen knife, told him, â€œWe are not done with you.â€ Pushed to the ground and kicked in the face and chest, he eventually lost consciousness.â€œThat day, I saw myself dying on the pitch,â€ Sissoko said.Yet the referee ruled that Sissoko, a 6-foot midfielder, had provoked the fight and gave him the first red card of his career as he lay unconscious on the field.â€œThat is the world of soccer for people of color: You have to be three times better than your adversaries, or fight,â€ said Francis Mante, 39, a referee and former amateur player in the Strasbourg area. Mante, who is from Ghana, arrived in France in 1998.â€œWe call it the beautiful game,â€ he added, â€œbut it's set up in a very cruel world.â€Laouali, as well as two players from Mackenheim, received the same 10-game ban that Sissoko received. The league also fined Mackenheim 500 euros, or about $575, for failing to control its fans, but its ruling did not address the players' accusations of racism, arguing that only the black players had reported hearing the racist insults.â€œWhenever black people say they face racism, we question their legitimacy, we disqualify their claims,â€ said Thuram, who now heads the Lilian Thuram Foundation, an antiracism organization. He argued that a similar form of colorblindness had been on display after France's victory in the World Cup, when many refused to acknowledge that the team's diversity partly explained its success.â€œIn the U.S., people highlighted the fact that there were many black players of African origin in the French team,â€ Thuram said. â€œAnd in France, people say, â€˜No, there are only French.'â€What unfolded during that violent game in May, though, on a field squeezed between cornfields and a pine forest, shocked the entire soccer community in eastern France.With more than 210,000 registered players, the Great East League is one of the country's biggest amateur organizations, one known for its ethnic and religious diversity — some clubs are made up exclusively of Turkish, Portuguese or Spanish players — but also for instances of violence and racism. A few days before Sissoko was beaten in May, for example, Mante, the referee from Ghana, was walking to his car with his family after a game between two small clubs when he heard the president of one of the teams tell him to â€œgo eat your banana.â€The president received a 10-month suspension, and his club was fined â‚¬100 for the insult but refused to acknowledge that it was racist. â€œThe federation sanctions those who insult referees, even if it's a ridiculous sanction,â€ Mante said. â€œBut if you are victim of racism as a player, you barely have a chance.â€Although the two Mackenheim players who received suspensions for the brawl in May acknowledged that the violence was unacceptable, they denied that racist or xenophobic feelings had motivated their acts, arguing that they were of Turkish origin and thus could not be racist toward black people. Both declined to speak on the record, though, citing fear of reprisals.â€œYes, there is some racism in Mackenheim,â€ said Victor Gallin, 22, a defender for the team that bears the town's name. â€œBut our players have never been racist. Never.â€But Cynan Keles, 18, an A.S. Benfeld player of Turkish heritage, suggested that the black players on his team had been targeted specifically because of their skin color.â€œCall it the way you want, but the Turkish players of Mackenheim would have never dared touch us, the other Turks,â€ he said.Sissoko filed a complaint with the police in May, and the results of the investigation are expected to be made public by the end of October. Anne Hussenet, the prosecutor in charge of the case, said the police still had to determine what had precipitated the violence, which she said had been caused in part by the tensions during the game and also, potentially, â€œby another kind of motives.â€In Strasbourg, the regional federation has implemented measures to fight intolerance, including one in which captains of opposing teams meet to socialize ahead of matches that bear some risk of violence or tension. In such games, the federation can also appoint additional delegates to support the referee.Sissoko, meanwhile, was recently found to have severe post-traumatic stress disorder; he said he still wakes up from nightmares months after the beating. He played with A.S. Benfeld for the first time since the incident on a recent Sunday and said that while he was happy to be back on a field, he worried about physical contact with other players. â€œI feel like I'm not 100 percent present on the pitch, and as soon as I can pass the ball, I get rid of it,â€ he said after the game.With the help of local organizations, he is hoping to put his experience to use by creating a statement against racism and intolerance that amateur clubs in the region will have to sign.â€œWhat happened cannot happen again here,â€ Sissoko said. â€œNever.â€"
"(Reuters) - Five-a-side football pitch operator Goals Soccer Centres suspended trading in its shares on Wednesday after saying it had identified ""substantial misdeclaration"" of value added tax (VAT) as part of an ongoing investigation into historical accounting errors.The company, in which Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has an 18.92 percent stake, said it was yet to establish the final value of misdeclarations but that the value identified so far was about 12 million pounds.The AIM-listed company, whose 5-a-side pitches and FA affiliated leagues are a familiar feature of UK towns and cities, said on March 8 it was investigating historical accounting errors whose financial impact was significant.The company, which replaced KPMG with BDO as its auditor in June last year, has also warned that its 2018 results will be materially below expectations.The Scotland-based company said it would enter into discussions with the government and that it remained in talks with its lenders over new facilities.It said it would now adopt new VAT accounting policies which may impact its profitability going forward. However, it said trading in the UK and the United States since March 8 had been strong compared to last year.Established in 2000, Goals is currently led by ex-Disney executive and former Manchester United Commercial Director Andy Anson and has 50 sites globally.

"An athlete who feels he is underappreciated can sulk, sound off to the media, or go on a Twitter rant. Or he can invent a new statistic that proves his worth.That's what two defensive midfielders did, and now their invention is the talk of soccer's statistics world.Stefan Reinartz and Jens Hegeler were defensive midfielders in the Bundesliga in 2015 when they created the metric known as packing. The rudimentary statistics in soccer, like goals and assists, cast favorable light primarily on strikers and attacking midfielders, the players who do most of the scoring and assisting. The grunts of the sport, defensive-minded midfielders like Reinartz and Hegeler, often get offensive moves started, but they are seldom recognized statistically.Reinartz and Hegeler reasoned that what they did best was move the ball past opposition players. That is what packing measures.â€œFootball is a low-scoring game, and it's not possible to rate a dozen players based on just three goals,â€ said Lukas Keppler, the managing director of Impect, the company that now tracks the stat.â€œStefan is not one making spectacular dribbling, but he has a great passing game, which wasn't analyzed as he wished. Simple vertical passing wasn't appreciated. Maybe now, you have a number that shows the person making the passing is more valuable that the player who makes the spectacular shot without any outcome.â€The methodology behind packing is fairly easy to understand. Essentially, players earn a point for any move — a cross, a dribble, a long pass — that causes the ball to move past opposition players. If a move begins with five opponents between the ball and the goal, and ends with two, that's three points. The receiver of the pass is awarded points as well.So who shines most in packing? The best player this season, as he has been for some time, is Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos, who has bypassed 79 opponents per game and whose total sometimes reaches 100. The typical team as a whole bypasses an average of 306 players each game.As for those on the receiving end of decisive passes, the leader is Eden Hazard of Chelsea, with 102 per game.Perhaps more incisive than just looking at the overall packing number is focusing specifically on bypassed defenders, who are after all the last outfield players with a chance to stop a goal. Lionel Messi is on top this season with 18 bypassed defenders per game.The method can also help draw comparisons between teams that play very different styles. â€œBayern, P.S.G. and Barcelona have a lot of ball possession,â€ Keppler said. â€œOther teams counterattack and press high. Packing would measure the value of their overall method.â€Four games into the Premier League season, Liverpool was averaging 57 bypassed defenders, the best figure in the league. They had been bypassed an average of only 26 times, for a net of plus-30, comfortably the best as well. They were followed in net bypassed defenders by Manchester City (18), and Bournemouth (15). At the bottom of the table is West Ham at minus-25.And teams with good packing numbers are usually good teams. â€œIf you have the quality to have a really good buildup, then you can see it on a statistical basis that those teams are more successful,â€ Keppler said.In the World Cup, no one bypassed more defenders than Belgium, the surprising semifinalists.Over the last year, references to packing have turned up more and more on blogs and message boards of statistically savvy fans. In that regard, it seems to be approaching the hotness of expected goals, or xG, the most buzzed-about advanced stat of the last few years. That statistic is built around shots taken, so, again, defensive midfielders like Hegeler and Reinartz are mostly left outside its measurements.The de-emphasis on scoring could be a reason to fault the new stat. A series of moves that gets the ball up field and past several opposing players would score well in a packing discussion. But it would little benefit the team if an attacker then gave the ball away or shanked a shot.Hegeler now plays for Bristol City in England, while Reinartz is retired. But their company, Impect, is thriving, collecting and selling packing data. Clients include ARD, the German broadcaster, and about 15 clubs, mostly in Germany. They have recently added Huddersfield Town, their first Premier League club.The company has 65 operators just for data collection and now tracks packing in England, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. It plans to add Major League Soccer starting next season.So that leaves the big question. Why do they call it packing? â€œâ€˜Bypassed defenders' sounds boring,â€ Keppler said. The bypassed players, you might say, â€œare â€˜packed away' and somehow taken out of the game.â€So packing it is. Get used to hearing about it."
"A soccer player who was jailed in Thailand and faced being sent back to his native Bahrain, where he said he would be imprisoned and tortured, was released Monday after Thai prosecutors dropped the extradition case against him.On Tuesday afternoon, the player, Hakeem al-Araibi, arrived back in Australia, where he has refugee status. He was greeted at the airport in Melbourne by a swarm of well-wishers, who started singing, â€œYou'll Never Walk Alone,â€ a popular soccer anthem.â€œAmazing to see all the people here,â€ he said. â€œI'm going to die in Australia. Australia is my country,â€ he added. â€œI love Australia.â€Mr. al-Araibi, 25, who had been a star defender for the Bahrain national soccer team, fled the small Gulf nation in 2011 during a crackdown on Arab Spring protesters. He said he had been tortured by government security forces. He has been playing soccer for a minor team in Melbourne, Australia.After his arrest in November at an airport in Bangkok, he became the focus of lobbying by diplomats, prominent sports figures and a social media campaign under the hashtag #savehakeem.Mr. al-Araibi left for Australia as soon as his departure was approved.â€œThis is the best outcome,â€ said his lawyer, Natalie Bergman. â€œIt should have happened from the beginning, but later is better than nothing.â€After Mr. al-Araibi's arrival in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne released a joint statement commending the Thai government for its decision and noting the â€œconstructive dialogue that we have had with Bahrain in helping to resolve this issue.â€The statement added: â€œWe know all Australians will deeply appreciate the decision, allowing him to return to his wife, family and friends.â€Mr. al-Araibi traveled to Thailand last year for a honeymoon and was detained with his wife. She was released, but Mr. al-Araibi remained in detention as Bahrain pursued his extradition.He had been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison for charges including the burning of a police station, which he said occurred while he was playing in a televised match.The royal family of Bahrain, which is Sunni Muslim, has pursued an aggressive crackdown against calls for democracy from the kingdom's Shiite Muslim majority, including a campaign of widespread arrests and many convictions on what human rights groups say are trumped-up charges.Thailand, which has been run by a military junta since a 2014 coup, has sent people fleeing political oppression back to countries including China, raising fears that Mr. al-Araibi would also be returned.But the country has also shown signs that it can be moved by international pressure.Last month, a Saudi woman who said she was fleeing abuse from her family barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room and rallied support to her cause online. The woman, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, was allowed to leave the airport after a two-day standoff and was granted asylum in Canada.Mr. al-Araibi received widespread support from the international sports world, including FIFA, the international body that oversees global soccer; the International Olympic Committee; and the World Players Association, an umbrella group representing 85,000 professional athletes worldwide.Jamie Vardy, a striker for the English Premier League club Leicester City, expressed support for Mr. al-Araibi on Twitter, and Craig Foster, a broadcaster and former captain of the Australian national men's team, was a prominent advocate for his release.â€œThis is a big victory for that global campaign and marks the fact that football will have to play an important role in human rights going forward,â€ said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. â€œThey call football the beautiful game, and it is a beautiful day for the beautiful game.â€Mr. Foster, who lobbied FIFA officials and shouted his support to Mr. al-Araibi when he appeared at a hearing last week in leg shackles, expressed his gratitude to the Thai government for dropping the case.â€œMost important thing now is Hakeem's immediate well-being,â€ Mr. Foster said on Twitter after the ruling was announced. â€œSure embassy staff will take care of him, there'll be tears there tonight, as there are in our household right now.â€When Mr. al-Araibi arrived in Melbourne, Mr. Foster placed his arms around his shoulders.â€œTo see him back here on home soil today speaks volumes about the character, the values and the pride that we have as Australians,â€ Mr. Foster said.The Thai foreign minister, Don Pramudwinai, visited Bahrain and met on Sunday with Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the crown prince, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported. No details of their discussion were released.The decision to drop the case came after the government of Bahrain told Thai diplomats that it did not want to pursue it, said Chatchom Akapin, director general for international affairs for the Thai attorney general's office.â€œWe got information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning that Bahrain is not interested in extraditing Hakeem anymore,â€ he said. â€œTherefore, the attorney general office decided it was no use to pursue the case.â€"
"EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — U.S. Soccer approached the gray-haired coach with a favor to ask.The federation had just parted ways with Bruce Arena as coach of the men's national team, and while it searched for his replacement, there were training camps to be run, players to be coached and games to be played. Could you help us through this rough patch, Arena's longtime assistant was asked, and run the ship while we navigate the transition?Yes, the assistant had replied. A proud company man, of course he would do it.But soon the search for Arena's replacement stalled, months passed, and some of the new players the coach had brought in started to look like keepers. The results weren't bad, either. And that is how, in May 2007, Bob Bradley went from caretaker manager to coach of the United States national team.Eleven years later, almost no one expects Dave Sarachan — the right-hand man on the Arena coaching staff that oversaw last year's World Cup qualifying debacle, and the man currently managing that team's reconstruction — to follow Bradley's path to the top job. But, a year after a loss at Trinidad and Tobago brought U.S. Soccer's world crashing down, here he remains as the coach: a symbol of the old leadership guiding the next generation of top Americans through their first few steps as international players.On Tuesday, Sarachan, who was hired to oversee one game, will lead the United States against Peru for its 10th under his unlikely watch. That he will be there at all will be viewed by some as an indictment of U.S. Soccer's ability to reform itself after its darkest hour, to emerge from a year of anger, disappointment and upheaval with new faces and new ideas.For Sarachan, 64, that is not his concern. While Bradley turned his six-month cameo as a place-holder into a four-year tenure, he had not started it after missing a World Cup. Sarachan, on the other hand, viewed his task as moving the humbled national team he inherited into a new era, and so he has made that his singular focus.â€œI didn't take this with the idea, thinking, what's it going to be like in a year or two?â€ Sarachan said. â€œBut now that the year's over, there's a body of work there that I feel very proud of.â€In nine games in charge (he is 3-3-3), he has eased 19 new players into the team and surrounded them with other fresh faces in a concerted effort to widen the player pool and give the United States and its fans something to cheer about again.â€œObviously, when we started after that disappointment, the elephant in the room was — everyone knew what it was,â€ said the 23-year-old defender Matt Miazga, who was among the players called in to Sarachan's first camp for a friendly against Portugal. â€œBut the reality is, this is life: There's going to be setbacks, there's going to be disappointments. You've just got to keep working and look to rebound and forget about it and look forward.â€Said midfielder Wil Trapp, 25: â€œIt's a process that we've had to deal with as players and as a whole organization. The process itself has gone well: We've brought in new players, we've played difficult games, we've really tried to break in this group of new players in a difficult but good way.â€Will Sarachan get at least two more games in charge next month to continue that process? Hard to say. There are whispers that an announcement on a permanent coach is close; Earnie Stewart, the general manager tasked with making the choice, told the players in camp this week that he expected to meet his self-imposed Nov. 1 deadline for a decision.But until someone tells him the job is no longer his, Sarachan will keep doing it. In September, he talked about continuing to bring in new players for the rest of the year, implying that he would be doing the choosing. Last week, he began reintegrating veterans like Michael Bradley and Brad Guzan into the roster. Bradley made his return to the national team in Thursday's loss to Colombia; Guzan will start on Tuesday.Even as the veterans return to fight for their roles, the changes Sarachan has overseen are starting to stick. Young players have taken on leadership roles on the field and off, Trapp said, and results like a win over Mexico and a tie against the world champion, France, have offered a whiff of what might be achievable when the exhibitions end and the games start to count again, next year.For the players he calls in month after month, it is the opportunity of a lifetime. Trapp will hope to have another chance to prove himself against Peru. So will Miazga and the 18-year-olds Timothy Weah and Josh Sargent, and even their unlikely coach, Sarachan. U.S. Soccer may be stuck in place, but the program will continue to press ahead.â€œThe ship,â€ Miazga said, â€œhas to continue to sail.â€"
"LONDON — The diplomatic standoff between Qatar and its Arab neighbors spilled into the sports world once again Thursday as a Qatari vice president of Asia's soccer confederation was barred from traveling to the United Arab Emirates ahead of the region's top tournament.Saoud al-Mohannadi, vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, was denied permission to travel from Oman to the U.A.E. after airport officials said he wouldn't be let into the country. The U.A.E., with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other Mideast countries, broke diplomatic relations and severed all ties with Qatar in 2017.Mohannadi is the chairman of the A.F.C.'s competitions committee, a group with overall responsibility for the Asian Cup. Prohibiting him from traveling to the U.A.E. is the first sign that long-simmering political tensions in the Gulf are likely to have ramifications for continent's biggest tournament.Mohannadi immediately wrote a letter of complaint to Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini royal who is the A.F.C.'s current president. The organization said in a statement that it was aware of reports that Mohannadi was being denied the right to travel and that it would investigate. The A.F.C. said it had been â€œassured of visas and entry permitsâ€ for tournament organizing committee members and executives.The Saudi-led diplomatic dispute with Qatar included the suspension of flights between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several other countries. Only recently have Qatari citizens been allowed to apply for permission to travel between the two countries. Such travel typically requires a visa and an approval letter from local authorities.Mohannadi, who in 2017 successfully managed to overturn a one-year FIFA ethics ban, had applied to enter the U.A.E. Local organizers told him he could travel there even though he had not received official clearance, according to people familiar with the matter. He traveled from Doha to Muscat, Oman's capital, where he was told his clearance was not registered.The soccer federation in Qatar, which will host the World Cup in 2022, said in a statement that it had reached out to the A.F.C. about the matter. â€œWe will comment further once we have an official response on the incident,â€ the federation said.The diplomatic dispute, which exploded in the spring of 2017, has already impacted regional sports. Players and officials on teams from countries opposed to Qatar initially refused to speak to beIN Sports, the Qatari-owned network that owns the rights to the A.F.C.'s events. For much of the past year, BeoutQ, a bootlegging television network, has been unimpeded in broadcasting pirated beIN Sports events using a satellite operator based in Saudi Arabia.BeoutQ was launched in response to the governments of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. blocking the sale of beIN Sports as part of a blockade that has closed off air and sea access between the countries.Mohannadi's travel plans are unlikely to be the last flashpoint in the 24-team tournament that kicks off on Saturday. The draw, made in May, set up a match between foes Qatar and Saudi Arabia on Jan. 17. It's unlikely many, if any, Qatari supporters will make the trip to Abu Dhabi.â€œThat's almost more difficult to imagine than the U.S. national soccer team playing Iran in Tehran,â€ said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at London's Chatham House, a British foreign affairs think tank. â€œThere will be some jittery people in Qatar hoping their players make it home.â€Mohannadi is one of two candidates who will be challenging Sheikh Salman for the A.F.C.'s presidency later this year. The other candidate is Mohammed Khalfan al-Romaithi, a sports official from the U.A.E."
"The United States national team's road to the 2019 Women's World Cup will run through Le Havre, France, and Alicante, Spain, but also Nashville, St. Louis and Harrison, N.J.Those sites, and five others, were part of a schedule of matches released Thursday by U.S. Soccer. The slate of games includes tests against World Cup mainstays like France, England, Japan and Brazil, as well as spring friendlies against Australia, Belgium, South Africa and Mexico. The team will play on two continents and in seven states as it prepares for the World Cup in France; only California will play host to the team twice.The first two games will be in Europe — against France (Jan. 19) and Spain (Jan. 22) — and the schedule includes three matches in the team's annual SheBelieves Cup tournament and another three in a so-called send-off series in May. The World Cup opens June 7 in Paris.The United States will learn the dates and sites for its first three World Cup games later this week; the draw for the 24-team tournament is Saturday.The six-month schedule leading into the World Cup is the longest U.S. Soccer has ever announced at one time for the women's team, and both the federation and the team's players association praised the benefits — to both sides — of the longer-term commitment.In the past, the team was sometimes informed about the dates of training camps and matches as little as six weeks in advance, which complicated everything from planning vacations and birthdays to scheduling surgeries and weddings. But those short windows also posed problems for the federation, which had less time to sell tickets for the matches; for fans, who might want to travel to them; and for sponsors interested in rolling out marketing plans related to the team.The six-month calendar, then, is the most obvious recent product of an improved working relationship between U.S. Soccer and an energized women's national team players association, which has pressed, both through its collective bargaining agreement and in bi-weekly meetings between the union's executive director, Becca Roux, and federation officials, for more concrete commitments about when the players will be expected to be available.â€œThese little wins, which to other people have little meaning, they're huge for us,â€ United States midfielder Allie Long said Thursday morning after speaking at a players association forum in New York.Long said she planned her October 2016 wedding, for example, by leaning on older teammates more familiar with the rhythms of the team's training camps, but she said she could not complete the final details until U.S. Soccer had locked in the games that book-ended the ceremony.The players' more proactive role in talks with the federation, and U.S. Soccer's willingness to address their concerns, has also shown up in other ways since the sides agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in April 2017. After years of regular games on artificial turf, the women's team — which had long grumbled about the surface — played its entire 2018 schedule on natural grass. The 10 matches announced by U.S. Soccer on Thursday also will be on grass.â€œIt shows that they're changing,â€ Long said. â€œBut it also shows that what we have been fighting for is worth it.â€"
"Aldyr Schlee, a professor who designed the Brazilian soccer team's signature jersey, now instantly recognizable around the world, died on Nov. 15 at a hospital in Pelotas, Brazil. He was 83.The Associated Press, which reported Mr. Schlee's death, said he had skin cancer.Mr. Schlee was a professor for 30 years at the Federal University of Pelotas and an award-winning journalist and author, the Agencia Brasil website reported, but he was best known for the jersey he designed.The jersey can trace its origins to 1950, when Uruguay beat Brazil in the World Cup, which was hosted by Brazil. Brazilians considered the loss to be the worst soccer defeat in their history. The losing team wore an all-white uniform then, and after the loss, it decided it wanted a more patriotic look.A newspaper in Rio de Janeiro, Correio da ManhÃ£ (The Morning Mail), sponsored a contest in 1953 to come up with a new design. The only requirement was that the jersey had to use the colors of the Brazilian flag: blue, green, white and yellow.Mr. Schlee was 19 and working as an illustrator at a newspaper in Pelotas. He was puzzled at the contest requirement.â€œNo team uses four colors, and the colors in the flag are colors that don't go well together,â€ he told Fox News in 2014. â€œHow can you put yellow and white together on a shirt?â€Mr. Schlee won the contest nevertheless, and what he created became one of the most well-known uniforms in professional sports — a canary yellow shirt trimmed in Kelly green with a touch of stark white, along with shorts of ocean blue.â€œIt completely changed the game,â€ Tom O'Grady, founder and chief creative officer of Gameplan Creative, a branding agency in Chicago, said in a phone interview on Sunday. â€œIt is the most popular and most iconic graphic of that sport.â€ (Mr. O'Grady has designed jerseys for the New York Knicks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Memphis Grizzlies.)Brazil's new team colors debuted in March 1954. The skill and flair of the superstar PelÃ© raised the uniform's profile even more as Brazil won the 1958 and 1962 World Cups. (The team did not wear the yellow jersey in the final of the 1958 tournament, however.) Brazil captured the cup again in 1970.â€œOnce you step on the field and the team starts winning, it freezes it in lock and step,â€ Mr. O'Grady said of the jersey. â€œThere is such a connection to the jersey and winning now that it almost parks it in eternity.â€Aldyr Garcia Schlee was born on Nov. 22, 1934, in JaguarÃ£o, Brazil, a municipality that borders Uruguay, the Brazilian news site Globo reported.Mr. Schlee had an intertwined history with Uruguay and Brazil. Though he designed the jersey for Brazil, he rooted for the Uruguayan team.On Friday, players from Brazil and Uruguay observed a moment of silence for Mr. Schlee before a game in London.Members of the Uruguayan team, in their blue jerseys, stood on the field with members of the Brazilian team, who wore the uniforms that Mr. Schlee had designed."
"LONDON — The Italian Super Cup final has been played on foreign soil nine times, including once in Tripoli at the invitation of the former Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi. But the site for this season's match is drawing a whole new level of criticism.At issue is the decision of Italian soccer authorities to forge ahead and stage the showpiece game — a matchup of the winners of the previous season's domestic league and cup competitions — in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, next month. The match would be played just months after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and while the kingdom continues to host the largest sports piracy operation in broadcasting history.The Italian league, Serie A, has been lobbied by human rights groups, a local journalists' union and the Qatar-based beIN Media Group — perhaps the biggest buyer of Italian soccer television rights — to remove the Jan. 16 game between Juventus and A.C. Milan from Saudi Arabia. (Juventus won both the league and the domestic cup last season, so Milan is the Super Cup opponent because it reached the cup final.)Saudi Arabia, which acquired the hosting rights in June as part of a three-match deal worth 21 million euros (about $24 million), has become one of the biggest buyers of sports properties in recent years, with investments including auto races, tennis matches and, more recently, international soccer events.It also is supporting an offer worth as much as $25 billion to acquire the rights to FIFA's Club World Cup and to create a separate competition for national teams. The proposal has split the leaders of major governing bodies in soccer, some of whom have protested Saudi support for the piracy of multimillion-dollar rights contracts owned by Qatar's beIN Sports.The journalists' union for the Italian state broadcaster RAI, which will air the Super Cup in Italy, said last month that it was â€œabsurd and unacceptableâ€ that the game would go ahead in light of the October killing of Mr. Khashoggi, which United States intelligence officials have concluded took place on the orders of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Sports leaders have been walking a diplomatic tightrope since the killing. In October, for example, Avram Glazer, the American co-owner of the English Premier League soccer club Manchester United, was one of the many business and political leaders to pull out of a high-profile investment conference in Riyadh — though Mr. Glazer did attend another event in the country, for Prince Mohammed's foundation, a few weeks later. Manchester United has earned millions from its relationship with Saudi Arabia through sponsorships and other agreements.Last month, the world's top-ranked men's tennis player, Novak Djokovic, confirmed that a scheduled exhibition match against Rafael Nadal later this month in Jidda had been postponed. Mr. Djokovic cited Mr. Nadal's ankle injury as the reason for the cancellation, but both players had come under growing pressure to withdraw after Mr. Khashoggi's murder.And on Dec. 8, beIN's chief executive, Yousef Al-Obaidly, wrote a two-page letter, which was seen by The New York Times, to Serie A's general director, Marco Brunelli, also protesting the fact that the Super Cup game would be played in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Al-Obaidly's frustration lies with beoutQ, a piracy operation that is seemingly based in the kingdom and that was set up in the aftermath of a blockade of Qatar led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. BeoutQ continues to broadcast premium sports content — including Serie A matches — illegally, and beIN noted that it has committed about $500 million to broadcast the Italian league games.â€œWe do not understand why Serie A has chosen to publicly reward the Saudi Arabian authorities by staging the prestigious Super Cup match in the country, and we would strongly ask you to reconsider,â€ Mr. Al-Obaidly wrote.Many of the league's other rights partners have not commented on the matter, including the United States-based sports management company IMG, which last year committed â‚¬1 billion to buy Serie A's overseas broadcasting rights for three seasons. IMG has other relationships and deals in Saudi Arabia, including as part of a partnership to organize a European Tour golf event there early next year.A spokesman for Serie A, citing confidentiality, declined to discuss what the league's response to beIN would be or to comment on the specific issues raised by human rights groups and the journalists' union.The auto racing series Formula E also is pressing ahead with plans to host its season-opening event in Saudi Arabia later this month. The series is partly owned by Liberty Global and Discovery Communications, which has seen a number of its Discovery channels made available in the Middle East and in parts of Europe through illegal beoutQ devices. Discovery declined to comment.â€œFormula E is a catalyst for change, not only with the wider automotive industry and the uptake of electric vehicles on a global scale, but also in playing a positive role in changing perceptions,â€ a Formula E spokesman said in an email message. â€œThe event in Ad Diriyah is an important opportunity to showcase the power and potential of clean technologies of the future — to a country moving away from dependency on oil and demonstrating a diverse economy.â€The spokesman declined to answer questions related to Saudi Arabia's human rights record or the death of Mr. Khashoggi."
"YOKOHAMA, Japan — A typhoon approached. Rain arrived by kickoff. Everyone in the sparse crowd seemed to be wearing a poncho or holding an umbrella.There was little reason to attend a middling second-division match here on the last day of September, but Junichi Onishi, 61, had an assignment. He has covered soccer for three decades for Sports Nippon, Japan's oldest sports newspaper. And he was on watch.â€œIn case Kazu plays,â€ Onishi said.He was referring to Kazuyoshi Miura, the pioneering and flamboyant Japanese forward who is still going at age 51. Last year, Miura became what was believed to be the oldest professional player to score a goal, pouncing on a rebound at 50 years 14 days and launching into a samba strut known as the Kazu Dance.Of course, these things can never be said with complete certainty. Even Miura is quick to offer a caveat. â€œI'm sure there is someone in fourth or fifth league in Brazil who scored at 54,â€ he said.His hair has gone gray and his playing time is scant, his dancing scarce. As September ended, Miura had made only eight appearances in Yokohama F.C.'s first 35 matches in the J2 League, all off the bench, and none since late July. And there has not been a single goal to leave him shaking his hips as if at Carnival.â€œWhen you are 51 years old, you lose power; fitness is very complicated,â€ said Edson Tavares, Yokohama's Brazilian manager. â€œI have to be honest with him. When it's possible, I use him.â€Even on the bench, though, Miura still brings value, Tavares said, to a small club unaccustomed to big expectations. He maintains an ebullient attitude. He trains fastidiously. And he eats — well, everyone has a favorite story about the way he supposedly eats.He is up at 5 in the morning for breakfast, prepared by a personal nutritionist. If his iron levels are low, he finds a restaurant and eats liver. After training, he dips his legs in an ice bath and drinks what some say is a large amount of orange juice. Only it is not orange juice; it is special carbonated water from Italy.Into his 30s, according to the Japanese sports magazine Number, Miura could eat an entire cake by himself. Now it's all high protein and low fat, steak fillets and salad with olive oil for dressing. A sports website called Spollup reported that he checks his weight and body fat four or five times a day.â€œJapan needs to grow little steps to be high professional,â€ Tavares said. â€œKazu gives a good example, pushing people, motivating the players.â€His face still appears on billboards, and his No. 11 can be found on everything from replica jerseys to cellphone covers. He is widely viewed as gracious, unpretentious, dutiful with fans to shake hands and sign autographs, even if his availability to the news media can be as elusive as his playing time.He is considered by many Japan's first soccer superstar. He played in Brazil for Santos, PelÃ©'s old club, and for Genoa in Italy and Dynamo Zagreb in Croatia. When the J League began play in 1993, Miura brought flair with the way he played and spoke his mind. He was honored as the league's first most valuable player, and accepted the award in a red suit.â€œWithout Kazu, the league would never have been as successful as it is,â€ said Kenji Hattori, the general manager of Yokohama F.C.Beyond soccer, Miura represents the possibilities of aging productively in a country that, according to the World Economic Forum, is second only to Hong Kong with an average life expectancy of 83.8 years.â€œWe cannot just sit and draw a line at a certain age,â€ said Nobuko Kamiya, 68, a retired teacher who follows Yokohama F.C. at home and on the road. â€œKazu gave me the inspiration to keep on going; something may come to you.â€Why does he keep playing at 51? Because he loves soccer and has avoided serious injury, Miura told The Japan Times last year. Some fans and reporters believe he is still spurred, two decades later, by the slight of being omitted from Japan's team for its inaugural appearance in the World Cup, in 1998.That hope may drive him still; when FIFA last year approved an expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, Miura, who last played for Japan nearly two decades ago, saw an opening. â€œIt is important to keep dreaming,â€ Miura told Reuters. â€œSo playing at the World Cup is still my dream.â€Kota Ishijima, an interpreter who has worked with Japanese baseball players, including Hideki Irabu with the Yankees, compares Miura to Ichiro Suzuki, who has moved — at age 44 — from the field to the front office with the Seattle Mariners.Such players appear to be on an unending search of what the Japanese call â€œyoushikibi,â€ the beauty of form, Ishijima said. â€œIt's like Chuck Yeager chasing demons beyond the sound barrier,â€ she said, referring to the famed American test pilot.Over the summer, Miura traveled with a friend, the photographer Goya Nagawa, to see Japan play in the World Cup in Russia. He exchanged emails with players on the national team, Nagawa said, and joked that they should tell Japan's coach, Akira Nishino, â€œI'm available if he needs me; I can play 15 minutes.â€He is always available. On Sept. 30, as Yokohama F.C. fell behind Renofa Yamaguchi F.C. in the first minute and scrambled futilely to catch up, Miura retreated to a sheltered area behind the bench. He placed a mat on the concrete and did planks and situps. He stayed ready but was not called on in a 3-2 defeat.Afterward, Miura stood with his teammates, bowed to the crowd, waved and then disappeared beneath the stands. It was midafternoon. Typhoon Trami churned toward Japan. A fierce wind was on the way. Some trains would soon stop operating.â€œPlease go home early,â€ the public address announcer said.A while later, Miura left the stadium in a cap and sunglasses, without saying a word. Onishi, the sportswriter, would have to wait at least another week to get his story."
"PRESTON, England — A jury at the trial of a former police chief in charge of operations at the 1989 Hillsborough soccer stadium crush that killed 96 Liverpool supporters failed on Wednesday to reach a verdict on whether he was guilty of manslaughter.The victims, many young, died in an overcrowded, fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, northern England, at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on a warm, sunny afternoon in April 27 years ago.Harrowing images of young fans crushed against metal fences, bodies lying on the pitch and spectators using wooden advertising hoardings as makeshift stretchers horrified the nation.Police at first blamed the disaster on drunken fans, an explanation that was always rejected by survivors, relatives of the victims and the wider Liverpool community who spent years fighting to find out what had happened.Later inquests and a damning independent inquiry absolved the fans of any responsibility.After a 10-week trial and eight days of deliberation, a jury at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday failed to reach a decision on charges of manslaughter by gross negligence against former Chief Supt. David Duckenfield, the police officer in charge on the day. He had denied the charge. ""We have discussed the matter carefully with counsel and I can confirm the CPS will seek a retrial against Mr Duckenfield,"" Sue Hemming from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement.The jury did, however, find former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell guilty of a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act.The Hillsborough tragedy, which happened within minutes of kick-off, changed the face of English soccer. Banks of terracing and metal fences around pitches disappeared, replaced by modern, all-seated venues and better security.The jury had heard that 96 died as a result of a crush. However, under the law at the time, there could be no prosecution for the 96th victim as he died over a year after the tragedy.""While forthcoming legal proceedings restrict comment on the outcome of the trial, we acknowledge the guilty verdict for Graham Mackrell and can empathise with the frustration shared by everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy that the outcome was not definitive,"" Liverpool FC said in a statement https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/342932-liverpool-fc-statement-hillsborough-trial.""Furthermore, the journey not only to reach today's stage and continue, is testament to the perseverance and determination of all involved in the ongoing campaign for justice which is now into its 30th year.""

"LONDON — The authorities announced on Thursday that they had ended the search for the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot after their aircraft vanished over the English Channel on Monday.â€œWe reviewed all the information available to us, as well as knowing what emergency equipment was on board, and have taken the difficult decision to end the search,â€ David Barker, the harbormaster captain of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement posted by the police on Twitter.The search, which involved three planes, five helicopters, two lifeboats and the assistance of passing ships and fishing boats, covered an approximately 1,700-square-mile area, according to Mr. Barker.The police examined mobile phone data and satellite imagery, but no trace of the aircraft, Mr. Sala or the pilot, David Ibbotson, could be found.â€œThe chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote,â€ Mr. Barker said in his statement.After the authorities' announcement, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala's sister, held a news conference in Cardiff and asked the authorities not to call off the search.â€œPlease, please, please don't stop the search,â€ Ms. Sala said in Spanish, fighting back tears.She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.On Monday night, when his plane disappeared, Mr. Sala sent an  audio message to his family from the plane, in which he said, â€œI'm so afraidâ€ and warned that the aircraft â€œseems like it's falling to pieces.â€â€œIf, in an hour and a half, you have no news from me,â€ he said, â€œI don't know if they are going to send someone to look for me, because they are not going to find me.â€Mr. Ibbotson, whose identity was confirmed by the Humberside Police on Wednesday, used the Facebook check-in tool at the Nantes airport on Saturday afternoon. According to reports in the British news media, he had joked in Facebook comments that he was a â€œbit rusty with the ils,â€ referring to the Instrument Landing System.The Piper Malibu plane — a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft — departed Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Monday, and was headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales.Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward from Argentina, had left his homeland for Europe at the age of 16. He became a star playing for Nantes in the top French league, and was recently sold to Cardiff City. He was scheduled to join that team on Tuesday.By 8:23 p.m. Monday in Britain, his plane had disappeared from air traffic control radar about 15 miles north of Guernsey.Mehmet Dalman, the chairman of Cardiff City, said on Wednesday that there were no plans to reschedule the team's coming Premier League match, which is set to take place on Tuesday, according to the BBC.â€œI would be very surprised if there's any change to the schedule,â€ Mr. Dalman said.The owner of Cardiff City, Tan Sri Vincent Tan, thanked those involved in the search operation in a statement on Thursday.â€œMonday evening's news shook everyone at Cardiff City F.C. to the core,â€ he said. â€œWe were looking forward to providing Emiliano with the next step in his life and career.â€He added that the team continued to pray for Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson.The search for the aircraft, Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson might have been called off, but the disappearance remained an open case, according to Mr. Barker, the harbormaster captain.â€œWe will be broadcasting to all vessels and aircraft in the area to keep a look out for any trace of the aircraft,â€ he said in the statement. â€œThis will continue indefinitely.â€"
"LONDON — England football manager Gareth Southgate received the OBE award at Buckingham Palace on Thursday after steering the national team to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia last Summer.Southgate, 48, dressed in his trademark waistcoat, was presented the award for services to football by Prince Charles after he was included in Queen Elizabeth's 2019 New Year's honours list. ""It's very special,"" he told Sky Sports TV after the ceremony. ""It's a privilege to be the English manager and to receive an award from the royal family - as a proud royal fan, that was very special. It's a moment that will live with me for ever.""Last month, team captain Harry Kane received the MBE award. He was top scorer with six goals in Russia but the team was knocked out after a 2-1 loss to Croatia in the semi-finals.Southgate's OBE came as England climbed one place to fourth in FIFA's latest world rankings after Euro 2020 qualifying victories over the Czech Republic and Montenegro.

"KABUL, Afghanistan — The Afghan government is investigating allegations that players on the women's national soccer team were sexually and physically abused by male coaches and officials, including the head of the Afghan soccer federation, officials said on Tuesday.President Ashraf Ghani said in a closed-door speech to the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee on Monday that he had ordered the investigation into the Afghanistan Football Federation in response to a report in The Guardian last week whose revelations he called â€œshocking to all Afghans.â€FIFA, the world body regulating international soccer, is conducting its own investigation.The scandal has prompted the team's principal sponsor, the Danish sportswear company Hummel, to withdraw its support. â€œThe documentation presented to us is not only an indication of gross misconduct and abuse of power by the A.F.F. officials, it is in direct contrast to our values,â€ the company's chief executive, Allan Vad Nielsen, said in a statement. â€œWe have no other choice but to cancel the sponsorship.â€The accusations focus on Keramuddin Keram, the president of the Afghanistan Football Federation, which governs both men's and women's soccer, as well as other male officials from the federation.Khalida Popal, one of the original players on the women's team and a longtime manager, said Mr. Keram had sexually harassed players in a bedroom in his office. She said that the bedroom had been rigged so that it could be opened only from the inside with his fingerprint scan, and that he trapped women there.â€œThe president of A.F.F. and some trainers are raping and sexually harassing female players,â€ Ms. Popal said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.Ms. Popal fled Afghanistan in 2012 and obtained asylum in Denmark but has remained active with the national team, organizing training camps abroad.When she organized a training camp in Jordan in February of this year, Ms. Popal said, she was shocked that the Afghan federation sent a male trainer and a male official to chaperone the team. One of the men got drunk and tried to force some of the women into having sex with him, including inside the women-only dormitory, and both of the men sexually harassed team members, Ms. Popal said.When the players threatened to complain, Ms. Popal told The Guardian, Mr. Keram, a politically influential former governor of Panjshir Province, beat one of them with a snooker cue, and threw her and eight other women off the team, alleging they were lesbians.Hummel also focused on Mr. Keram. â€œAllegedly, the president was complicit in allowing the abuse to happen, and did not respond to the allegations put forward by the national team,â€ the company said.Ms. Popal said that when she learned in Jordan about the abuse of players, the victims were concerned about keeping everything quiet for fear that their parents would stop them from playing on the team. She said she had called Mr. Keram to tell him about the abuse.â€œHe promised that he would follow the issue and punish the abusive trainers,â€ she said. Instead, they were promoted to other federation jobs, she added.The Afghanistan Football Federation issued a statement calling the allegations â€œgroundlessâ€ and saying it had â€œa zero-tolerance policy toward any type of such behavior.â€It said no one had ever brought such accusations to its attention.Mr. Keram did not respond to repeated requests for comment over four days. His chief of staff, Massoud Hassimi, said Mr. Keram was still the federation president and that only the main doors of the federation's offices required fingerprint scans to open.The head coach of the Afghan women's team, Kelly Lindsey of the United States, expressed support for Ms. Popal and the players who have made the accusations. â€œOur Women have endured horrific Mental, Physical, and Sexual Abuse to play the sport they love for the country they love!â€ she wrote on Twitter.Mr. Ghani did not announce any actions against the soccer federation and did not say if he believed the accusations. â€œEven if mere allegations cause our people to stop sending their sons and daughters to sports, we need to act immediately and comprehensively,â€ Mr. Ghani said.Attorney General Mohammad Farid Hamidi promised to announce the results of his investigation within a week.â€œRule of law and justice protects the rights and honor of athletes and families who send their sons and daughters to pursue a profession in sports,â€ Mr. Hamidi said. (Mr. Hamidi himself was criticized in a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a United States agency, which said he presided over an â€œunproductive, corrupt and patronage-laden office.â€)FIFA said it had long been aware of the allegations and was investigating them. â€œFIFA has a zero-tolerance policy on human rights violations and condemns all forms of gender-based violence,â€ the organization said in a statement. â€œThe serious subjects mentioned are being looked into by FIFA.â€Neither the FIFA statement nor Afghan officials addressed calls from players and Hummel for the Afghan federation or Mr. Keram to be suspended. â€œOnce the facts are established, whatever remedial measures are needed will be taken,â€ a FIFA spokesman said.Accusations of sexual abuse against male officials running women's teams in Afghanistan are not new. In 2016, the head coach of the women's national cycling team was accused by the team's American founder and many of its members of repeatedly marrying and divorcing his riders, under duress, as well as other offenses. The coach, Haji Abdul Sediq Seddiqi, was fired but never prosecuted.The Afghan soccer federation claims to still have the backing of the women's team. â€œIt is grateful for the vocal support of its current female players, who have all published statements on the A.F.F. Facebook page,â€ it said.There was only one such statement of support on that Facebook page, and it did not mention the sexual abuse charges. It was from a former captain of the team, Farkhunda Muhtaj. The most recent captain, Shabnam Mobarez, quit that post last month, complaining that she could not sign a contract with the federation because it deprived players of their rights — including the right to complain."

"SEOUL — As South Korea's captain, Son Heung-min makes a point of sharing the credit for the team's successes and shouldering the blame for the failures and the flying forward did a bit of both after Tuesday's impressive 2-1 win over Colombia.Without a goal for the national team since June, when he sprinted from the halfway line to slot home into an empty German net at the World Cup, Son delivered one of his best performances in a Korean shirt as the home side saw off 12th ranked Colombia in a friendly in Seoul.Scoring the opener with a ferocious right-foot shot from inside the box, Son was a constant menace to the Colombian defence, his pace and movement giving the Koreans the perfect out-ball during periods of sustained pressure.The 26-year-old, who now has 24 goals in 79 international appearances, said he felt his personal struggles in front of goal has been talked about more than the team's recent good run under Portuguese coach Paulo Bento.The Koreans have won nine of their 14 games under Bento, who took over after the World Cup, their only defeat coming in the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup to eventual champions Qatar.""I felt like I was being a distraction to the rest of the team, because people kept mentioning my name when talking about the national team,"" Yonhap News quoted Son as saying after Tuesday's win. ""I couldn't have scored the goal today without the sacrifices of my team mates.""Son has mostly been used as a winger at international level but has been asked to play a more central role in Bento's experimental 4-4-2 formation against Colombia and Bolivia last Friday.While he did not find the net against the Bolivians, Son was at the heart of Korea's most dangerous moves before substitute Lee Chung-yong popped up with a late winner in a 1-0 victory.Son said he would play anywhere to help the team.""On my club, I've played both as a striker in a two-forward setting and as a winger,"" Son said. ""No matter where the coach puts me, my job is to do the best I can in that position. I think it's important for me to keep playing the way I did today. That kind of consistency will help the national team and myself as a player."" (Writing by Peter Rutherford; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"
"Alex Morgan scored her 100th international goal and substitute Mallory Pugh scored twice when the U.S. Women's National Team rallied to defeat Australia 5-3 in a friendly at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo., on Thursday.Megan Rapinoe broke a 2-2 tie in the 61st minute with a strike from 22 yards out for her 44th goal. Pugh, from Highland Ranch, Colo., replaced Rapinoe and her first touch extended the lead to 4-2 in the 67th minute with Emily Sonnett earning her second assist.Samantha Kerr's header pulled Australia to a 4-3 deficit in the 81st minute but Pugh chipped in the insurance goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time.Morgan opened the scoring in the 14th minute to become the 17th woman to reach the century mark.

"BUENOS AIRES — They are seductive, those images, those snapshots of a place where the colors shine brighter, the noise rings louder.It is all so vibrant, so alive — the sight of tens of thousands of fans mounting a pilgrimage just to see their team train; the sound of 70,000 in full voice, basking in glorious sunshine, hours before a game; the smell of the cordite; the smoke of the flares.But what makes the scene so mesmerizing — at least to the weary eyes of a European, or a North American, resigned to the corporatization of sport — is the sense that this is something that we have lost, or that this is how it should be.Those images are true, of course: Argentine soccer is vivid, pulsating with life in a way that, certainly in Europe, seems to have been condemned to the past. The stadiums shake with the noise, and the country with the fever of its obsession.It is true that Buenos Aires had been waiting with bated breath for a game it viewed as the most important in its history — the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors, this city's, this country's and this continent's two biggest clubs.It is true that so many fans went to watch Boca train on Thursday that the City Council — angered that they had exceeded the stadium's capacity — decided to close it.It is true that almost as many went to La Boca again on Saturday to wave their team off. It is true that, on a warm, sunny morning, everyone seemed to be wearing the colors of their team.And it is true that passion turned to mayhem Saturday afternoon, forcing a postponement of an event that felt unique: the first time the two rivals of the so-called SuperclÃ¡sico were meeting to decide the most significant competition on the South American calendar: the Final to End All Finals, the Final for All Time, La FinalÃ­sima.This is the other side, one that is off-putting rather than seductive. It is not unique to Argentina, not at all, but few countries struggle with it to such an extent.The trouble is not a direct consequence of those things that make Argentine soccer so appealing, but it is a result of allowing them to slip from control, to let them be used as justification for anything. And, to Argentina, it is a source of shame that on Saturday night, it showed that side to the world.As Boca Juniors' bus approached Estadio Monumental a couple of hours before kickoff, it turned down Avenida Monroe, a well-known gathering spot for River fans before games and not, as a rule, the route a visiting team would take. It was traveling quickly, flanked by police outriders.But as it slowed to turn a corner, the bus was confronted by hundreds of River fans. They threw stones, sticks and bottles. The windows shattered. The driver fainted. A Boca vice president, Horacio Paolini, had to take the wheel. The police, according to several reports, fired pepper spray to disperse the crowd. It drifted inside the bus.A few moments later, Boca arrived at the stadium, its players coughing, retching, their throats burning from the gas. Shards of glass had hit two players, Pablo PÃ©rez and Gonzalo Lamardo, in the eye. Others had been cut by the debris.â€œWe had come to play a game, and we found a completely different situation,â€ said Marcelo London, a Boca official.Boca immediately requested that the game be canceled or postponed. Conmebol, the competition organizer, demurred. It had a commitment to its broadcaster, Fox Sports. The Argentine government, with a summit meeting of the G20 to start in Buenos Aires this week, wanted this match out of the way.The game was delayed once, then twice, then a third time. Viewers around the world waited, left in the dark as to what was happening. Outside, fans without tickets broke down barriers and battled with the police to get inside.PÃ©rez and Lamardo were taken to a hospital for treatment; they were assessed, too, by Conmebol's own medical staff, who determined that their injuries were insufficient to warrant a cancellation.â€œThe presidents of FIFA and Conmebol are making us play,â€ Carlos Tevez, the Boca striker, said during the delay.Even the intervention of Marcelo Gallardo, the River manager, was insufficient. He had told Conmebol that if Boca did not want to play, then neither did River. The organization stood firm.â€œThe truth is, we are not in a condition to play,â€ Tevez said. â€œWe are waiting.â€They waited until just before 7:45 p.m. in Buenos Aires, the last suggested kickoff time. River's coaching staff had laid out cones on the field, ready for the warm-up. Fans had started singing again.Then, at last, Conmebol made the announcement. The game was off, postponed until Sunday, 5 p.m. Argentina time. A few hours later, the Buenos Aires Council confirmed that it had closed the Monumental.Rodolfo D'Onofrio and Daniel Angelici, the presidents of River and Boca, had reached a â€œgentleman's agreementâ€ not to play, said the president of Conmebol, Alejandro Dominguez. â€œOne did not want to play, and the other did not want to win in these circumstances,â€ he said.The fans whistled at the decision. As they left, some fought running battles with the police.It would be easy to suggest that all of the hyperbole in the buildup to the game had almost guaranteed that this would happen. Passion had been pushed to a breaking point. This was the result of all of the talk, all of the hysteria, around the Final to End All Finals.And yet that is not real, either, or not all of reality. On Wednesday, All Boys, a second-division team in the Floresta neighborhood of Buenos Aires, lost its own clÃ¡sico, against Atlanta, on a late goal. Its fans rioted, threatening Atlanta players on the field and fighting the police outside the stadium. River's meeting with Boca in the final of the Copa Libertadores might be unique, but the poison that devoured it is not.It has happened all too often here, of course; it is why since 2013 visiting fans have been barred from games involving Argentina's biggest teams. It is why so many dreaded this weekend, even as they shivered in anticipation of it.â€œThis country is not ready for a Boca-River final,â€ the journalist Andres Burgo said before the first leg, which ended in a 2-2 draw. They are used to it, resigned to it, imprisoned by it.The difference on Saturday was the scale of the audience. For once, Argentina felt the world was watching. â€œAnother opportunity lost in front of the whole planet,â€ Gabriel Batistuta, a former Argentina striker, wrote on Twitter. â€œShameful. Lamentable.â€This is the reality of Argentine soccer. The color, the noise, that stirring sense of the epic: All of that is real. But it does not exist in isolation. Left unchecked — or more than that, indulged — it stops being a sign of something that is intensely alive. It starts to symbolize something that is being allowed to die."
"PARMA, Italy — Fabio Quagliarella became Italy's oldest goalscorer as his double helped Roberto Mancini's rejuvenated side thrash 10-man Liechtenstein 6-0 in their second Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday.Quagliarella, 36, netted two first-half penalties, while 19-year-old Moise Kean scored his second goal in his third appearance. Stefano Sensi, Marco Verratti and Leonardo Pavoletti also found the net.Liechtenstein were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of halftime when Daniel Kaufmann was sent off for a handball on his goalline.Italy, who have a maximum six points in Group J after a 2-0 win against Finland on Saturday, controlled the midfield through Verratti while Quagliarella set an example with his aggression.The Azzurri, who are rebuilding under Mancini after missing out on the 2018 World Cup, broke the deadlock after 17 minutes as the 23-year-old Sensi's header from Leonardo Spinazzola's cross from the left found the roof of the net. Verratti doubled the tally with a fine curled shot into the far side of the goal on 32 minutes.Quagliarella scored his first goal from the penalty spot after a Nicolas Hasler handball, and his second after Kaufmann also used his arm and was shown a straight red card.Christian Panucci was Italy's previous oldest goalscorer at 35 years 62 days. Kean, who had endured a frustrating first half, headed home the fifth on 70 minutes with second-half substitute Pavoletti adding the sixth on his international debut, tapping in after Benjamin Buechel had parried the 30-year-old's header into his path.Italy next travel to Greece on June 8.

"LOS ANGELES — The United States women's national team pumped in four first half goals en route to a 6-0 romp against Belgium in a one-sided friendly as the reigning World Cup champions continue to build momentum ahead of their title defense in France in June.Carli Lloyd opened their account with a leaping header off a long pass from Tierna Davidson that found the bottom corner of the goal in the 14th minute.Five minutes later, the veteran midfielder unleashed another header to a nearly identical spot in the net to send the nearly 21,000 fans at the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles into a frenzy on a warm Southern California night.""I know who I am. I know what I'm capable of,"" Lloyd, who was making her first start this year, told reporters after the match.Forward Lindsey Horan nodded in a goal off a corner kick past diving Belgian goalkeeper Nicky Evrard in the 26th minute and midfielder Samantha Mewis effectively put the game out of Belgium's reach with a header to put the hosts 4-0 ahead.Forward Alex Morgan came on as a substitute to start the second half and scored two minutes later when she broke free of her defender, took a pass from Lloyd, and chipped a shot over Evrard's head for her 101st career goal. Forward Jessica McDonald completed the rout with a header off a set-piece move in the 90th minute as the team improved to 4-1-2 in 2019.The match was the last for the U.S. before the team selects its World Cup roster, which will look to bring the team home its fourth title.

"A small village in Argentina on Saturday bid farewell to a favorite son, the soccer striker Emiliano Sala, who died along with his pilot last month when his small plane crashed in the English Channel.Friends, family and supporters gathered early Saturday in the village of Progreso, in the country's northeast, for a wake at Mr. Sala's soccer boyhood club, San MartÃ­n de Progreso, where his body lay in state. A religious ceremony was held in the afternoon, and he was to be cremated, reports said.Outside the club, a banner read, â€œEmi, you will never walk alone.â€Mr. Sala's body arrived in the village on Friday, a little more than a week after his remains were found in the wreckage of the plane that went down shortly after takeoff from Nantes, France, for Cardiff, Wales.â€œWe are waiting for you, Emi,â€ the San MartÃ­n club posted on Facebook ahead of the body's arrival.The club's president, Daniel Ribero told Agence France-Presse, â€œHe represented a lot for us. We're a small village and Emi was a celebrity, the only player to turn professional.â€Mr. Sala, 28, started off as a youth player in his native Argentina and began his international career in France in 2010. He recently transferred to the English Premier League club Cardiff City from Nantes in the French league. The Cardiff club signed him for Â£15 million ($19 million) to add to its striking power.Representatives of both clubs attended the funeral service, the BBC reported and FC Nantes and fans paid tribute to Mr. Sala on Twitter.On Thursday, as two of his former French teams — SN Caen and FC Nantes — faced each other at Caen on France's west coast, signs paying tribute to the striker lined the pitch and players and fans joined in applause before the match began.Mr. Sala was flying to Cardiff with a pilot, David Ibbotson, on Jan. 21, when their single-engine, propeller-driven Piper Malibu vanished. An initial search for survivors was called off, but after pleas from Mr. Sala's family and a funding drive that raised more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000 in donations, the search resumed.Recovery crews sent by the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the wreckage of the plane and recovered Mr. Sala's body.An inquest into the crash has been adjourned until November, when police and air investigators will release more details about the accident.The pilot is still missing, and Mr. Ibbotson's family were seeking donations to help find and recover his body.â€œWe know that he's dead; we do know that, but we just want him home,â€ Nora Ibbotson, the pilot's wife, told a morning television show on the British network ITV on Monday. With the help of famous soccer players and fans, the fund-raiser was close to hitting its target of 400,000 pounds, around $515,000, according to its GoFundMe page.Although the wreckage of the Piper Malibu was not raised from the ocean bed, British investigators said underwater footage of the aircraft would help their work. The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it would publish early findings in the coming week."
"The mementos are everywhere, images of heroes past, snapshots of glories lost.For the current generation of players at Crvena Zvezda — the club known to the English-speaking world as Red Star Belgrade — they are inescapable: in the dressing rooms at the training facility, in the foyer as they walk into the stadium everyone in Serbia calls the Marakana.They act as a reminder, as proof, as assertion of what Red Star once was, of what it once did. There are photos of the club's greatest players and its greatest victories: against Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, all of European soccer's aristocrats.Some are of the Marakana itself, when it could hold more than 100,000 fans, when the noise was so deafening that, down in the tunnel before kickoff, the players say, they could feel the concrete walls vibrating. And more than one is of Red Star's crowning achievement, the trophy that elevates this club into soccer's most exclusive group: the European Cup.â€œIt's a big thing,â€ Milos Degenek, a defender for Red Star and Australia told Omnisport recently. â€œYou know you're walking into a club where some of the great players played, players who made an impact in European and world football, not just in Serbia. You know you're walking into a club that was a European champion, and a world champion.â€When the draw for the group stage of this year's UEFA Champions League was made in Monte Carlo a few weeks ago, Red Star attracted little attention. All the focus was elsewhere: on Real Madrid's attempt to win a fourth European title in a row, and Barcelona's attempt to stop it; on Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign with Juventus, and his return to Manchester United; on Paris St.-Germain's meetings with Liverpool and Napoli.To many — outside Serbia, at least — Red Star was, like the rest of the teams in Pot 4, something between a makeweight and an afterthought; it could hope to be little more than a nuisance for whichever superpowers ended up in its group (P.S.G., Liverpool and Napoli, in the end). Nobody debated how that draw might affect its chances of winning the competition. It would count as nothing short of a miracle if Red Star even managed to make the last 16.That is the nature of the modern Champions League, after all: it has become the exclusive preserve of a handful of teams, all of them drawn from Europe's big five leagues. It is not just an exercise in futile nostalgia to bemoan that. To mourn the fact that Red Star's victory — in the 1991 edition — can never be repeated is to ignore what makes the Champions League such a success.It is precisely because the same few teams — three from Spain, one from France and Italy, two from Germany and a rotating cast of four from England — make the latter stages every year that it has such an unyielding appeal. The Champions League's popularity, its ever-increasing significance, is that it is the one competition in which the very best in the world face each other every couple of weeks.And yet it is fitting that Red Star should be there this year, even if its visit proves only to be fleeting: not just to make up the numbers, not merely as an obstacle to be overcome, but as a memento, a reminder, of what has been lost.Red Star's triumph 27 years ago belongs to another world. That was the last year the European Cup was a straight knockout tournament, the last one featuring only the champions of Europe's domestic leagues. The following season, UEFA introduced a group stage for the first time, and by the 1992-93 season, the competition had been rebranded as the Champions League.By that stage, the exquisite, gifted team that had helped Red Star conquer the continent had been disbanded. Seeking sanctuary as much as sporting satisfaction, its players moved to Italy and Spain and France to escape Yugoslavia's bloody, brutal fragmentation.Red Star would never win another Champions League trophy; though it returned to defend its title in 1992, it was forced to play its home games in Bulgaria and Hungary. It would not be until this year that it could welcome the finest teams in Europe, the sorts of teams it used to consider its peers, back to Belgrade.That Red Star victory, though, represented something else: It was almost the last time a team from Eastern Europe was capable of competing with the giants of the West. Only Dinamo Kiev, which reached the semifinals in 1999, has come close to winning the Champions League in the years since. In retrospect, 1991 was the end not just for one club, or one country, but for half a continent.It can be hard, as the blistering tones of the Champions League anthem ring out and the spotlights shine in the night sky before each match, to see that as much of a loss: the competition itself, certainly, has not suffered in the last two decades.It remains the high-water mark for players, managers, executives and fans, the surest way to write your name into history, either as an individual or as a team. It has become inexorably more lucrative — the prize money available has almost doubled in the last few years — and, somehow, ever more glamorous.When we discuss whether Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest player of the modern era, it is their achievements in the Champions League that come under the most scrutiny. Ronaldo, Luka Modric and Mohamed Salah are the three contenders for this year's men's world player of the year award. It is telling that none won the World Cup this summer. Only Modric played in the final. The Champions League — where all three were finalists — is what counts.Yet there is a sense that somewhere, something has been lost. For the first time this season, the Premier League, the Bundesliga, La Liga and Serie A have each been guaranteed four spots in the group stage: half the field, drawn from only four of Europe's 53 countries.The way prize money is divided has been altered, too, to take into account past performances (so teams who have enjoyed more success can win more). Gradually, driven by the ever-present threat of a breakaway super-league, UEFA is bowing to the demands of Europe's richest, most famous clubs: That is why games will now be played in two time slots every Tuesday and Wednesday — more television coverage means more advertising space.UEFA revealed earlier this month that it plans to introduce a third European competition in 2021 — or, more accurately, reintroduce it, given that it abandoned the Cup Winners' Cup in 1999. Many in Europe's lower-profile leagues believe the most likely outcome of that process will be even fewer chances for teams from the lesser leagues to take the limelight, a streamlining of the Champions League and the Europa League so that more teams from the elite competitions can enter.In that context, Red Star's place in the Champions League speaks to more than just one club's pride: It is an echo of how things used to be, a message that there was a time when the playing field was not quite so egregiously tilted, when teams from across the continent could compete. It is a reminder that history did not start in 1992, that it is not just the titans of England and Spain and Italy who have a monopoly on greatness, on memories of glory.Marko Djordjevic, 30, was in Salzburg, Austria, last month, when Red Star confirmed its return to the Champions League. He plans to travel to Naples, too, for the only away game for which Red Star will be allowed to take fans — a punishment for the pitch invasion that greeted its progress.â€œIt is big for us,â€ Djordjevic said. â€œWe must show Europe that we have come back, that finally, we are back where we belong.â€This is not the competition Red Star won all those years ago, though. It has changed, almost beyond recognition, been tweaked and fine-tuned and altered in such a way that clubs like this are not meant to belong here at all. That, though, is why it matters that Red Star has made it, why it matters to hear that name back alongside the list of giants, that reminder of glories past."
"LEICESTER, England — Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, owner of the English Premier League soccer club Leicester City, was killed Saturday night when his helicopter crashed in a ball of flames outside the stadium, the team confirmed on Sunday.The soccer club announced late Sunday â€œwith the deepest regret and a collective broken heartâ€ that none of the five on board survived.The helicopter crashed about 8:30 p.m. outside King Power Stadium following Leicester City's game against West Ham United. One of Mr. Vichai's two daughters, Voramas Srivaddhanaprabha; two pilots; and an unidentified fifth person were also believed to have been on board, news media reports said.[Read Rory Smith's column on the crash in Leicester: Dread, Then Grief, Engulfs Leicester After Owner's Helicopter Crash]With little official information released by Mr. Vichai's family, the soccer club or the police for more than 24 hours after the crash, fans had filled the void with hope and expressions of gratitude.On Sunday, a steady stream of fans — first dozens and then hundreds — headed toward the King Power Stadium, bearing flowers, scarves and Leicester's Royal Blue jerseys, and laying their tributes carefully at an impromptu shrine outside the stadium.Against the wall rested an image of Ganesha — a testament to the substantial Hindu population in the city, about 102 miles northwest of London — and a small statue of Buddha — a tribute to Mr. Vichai's faith.Rosemary Page said she couldn't stay at home on Sunday. Since she and her husband, Andrew, heard reports of the crash, she had been unable to sleep.â€œYou just want to get more and more information,â€ Ms. Page, 61, said outside the stadium. â€œIt doesn't feel real. He was the best owner this club has ever had.â€To many, the crash felt personal. Mr. Vichai, a Thai billionaire who founded the duty-free retail giant King Power International and controls part of AirAsia, the region's biggest discount carrier, has been cherished by fans ever since he bought the team in 2010 for 39 million pounds.It had languished in the second-tier Championship. He then turned it into a Premier League champion by 2016 — the first title in its 132-year history.Among the tributes at the King Power Stadium were photos of Mr. Vichai at the victory parade and a T-shirt, printed in the aftermath of the 2016 victory, reading: â€œChampions of England, we know what we are.â€His popularity was not simply rooted in his success, however.â€œHe did so much in the community of the city, gave so much to charity,â€ said Nick Orr, 58, who came to the stadium to pay tribute with his family. â€œHe was just such a nice man. I don't say it lightly, but it feels like losing a member of your family.â€As the bouquets and mementos kept arriving on Sunday, staff members cordoned off more of the area outside the stadium as a shrine, as fans awaited word on Mr. Vichai, who had endeared himself to the crowds by giving away beer, scarves, pies, hot dogs and doughnuts at the stadium around his birthday.After Leicester City tied the game, 1-1, against West Ham on Saturday, many witnesses said they saw the chopper clear the stadium before it spiraled out of control. An investigation is underway to establish what, precisely, brought the helicopter down.The city felt as if it were already in mourning, as many feared the worst even before Mr. Vichai's death was confirmed.â€œEverybody waiting up to hear an update about a man we've either never met or met a few time, but adore and love,â€ Hayley Sanderson wrote on Twitter. â€œThat's the true meaning of football. Hearts breaking all over the city right now.â€â€œAbsolutely devastating news about the #LCFC helicopter crash,â€ Neil Harris wrote on Twitter. â€œAside from bankrolling the club for a decade, these guys have thrown millions at hospitals and local charities.â€â€œYou can't put into words the love and respect for them in this city,â€ Mr. Harris said.â€œHe's the man that allowed us to live the dream. There's not an owner in the country that comes close to how connected with a city like he became,â€ Kristopher Warder, who describes himself as a â€œmassive #LCFC fan,â€ wrote on Twitter on Saturday.The Leicester City players Harry Maguire and Wilfred Ndidi shared prayer emojis on Twitter, as did the former team member Islam Slimani. â€œSpeechless,â€ wrote Ben Chilwell, a defender for Leicester City and the English national team.Gary Lineker, one of England's most celebrated former professional soccer players and host of the popular BBC program â€œMatch of the Day,â€ began his career with Leicester City. He called the events â€œa terrible tragedyâ€ and â€œheartbreaking.â€News of the helicopter crash was breaking as Mr. Lineker's show began on Saturday night. â€œThat was the most difficult @BBCMOTD I've ever hosted,â€ he wrote on Twitter.There was so much public interest in the crash that the Leicestershire police released a statement asking the public to be â€œpatient, understanding and resist speculating on the detail and the circumstances.â€Emergency workers remained on the scene Sunday afternoon, and the police said they expected the inquiry to continue over the coming days."
"(Reuters) - Forward Alex Morgan reached a personal milestone with her 100th international goal as the United States beat Australia 5-3 in a friendly in Colorado on Thursday.In opening the scoring in the 15th minute with a superb solo run capped by a precise finish, Morgan became the seventh American woman -- 17th from any country -- to reach the century mark.It was far from smooth sailing for the reigning World Cup champions, who fell behind Australia early in the second half in front of a sellout crowd in suburban Denver.The home team, however, scored three times in 14 minutes to regain the lead for good in an entertaining encounter between two of the favorites heading into World Cup in France in June.Local favorite Mallory Pugh made it 4-2 by scoring less than a minute after coming on, before adding a second with a deft dink over the keeper in the final minute of stoppage time to seal the result.Earlier, Australia equalized on the half hour when pacy veteran winger Lisa De Vanna fired home.Caitlin Foord gave Australia the lead early in the second half, before Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe put the U.S. ahead again.Samantha Kerr scored with a thumping header in the 82nd minute to give Australia some hope, but the visitors could not find an equalizer.""We can't let that many goals in ... but they're a great attacking team so you've got to give them credit,"" said veteran Rapinoe after her 150th appearance for the U.S.The Americans continue their World Cup preparation with another friendly against Belgium in California on Sunday.

"There is no shortage of Lionel Messi content on the World Wide Web. The 31-year-old soccer superstar ranks high in surveys of top Google searches, one of just a few human beings to earn a spot among such keyword perennials as â€œFacebook,â€ â€œweatherâ€ and â€œfree porn.â€ In a 2015 tally of the most Googled person in each nation on earth, Messi tied Kim Kardashian for the most No. 1s, with a global reach that extended from his native Argentina to Haiti, Turkmenistan, Senegal and 22 other countries.Messi is also one of the world's pre-eminent viral video stars. Countless clips document â€œMessi magic,â€ a playing style of almost unseemly brilliance. On social media, users share videos of Messi's slipping passes through improbably tight spaces, corkscrewing shots past sprawling goalkeepers, darting around defenders like a jack rabbit navigating a gantlet of sloths. Type â€œMessiâ€ into a YouTube search field, and you will find hundreds of highlight compilations with bombastic titles: â€œLionel Messi sees things we don't even consider,â€ â€œLionel Messi: — A God Amongst Men,â€ â€œLionel Messi: Extraterrestrial.â€So it was not exactly surprising when, on March 17, the internet was captivated by a Messi goal. It came in the 85th minute of a 4-1 victory for Messi's club team, FC Barcelona, over the Seville-based Real Betis. Messi gathered the ball about 24 yards from the Betis goal, slid a pass to his teammate Ivan RakitiÄ‡ and then flowed forward to receive a return pass. The goal that followed was so easeful, so understated, that it was momentarily hard to process. Messi struck the ball in full stride but with shocking delicacy, lifting a chip shot that arced gracefully across the penalty area. The ball drifted beyond the reach of the goalie, Pau LÃ³pez, scraped the underside of the crossbar and dropped into the goal. Messi had taken his shot from a diagonal position more than 20 yards away, but it was not the stinging kick generally required to score from that spot. The ball's trajectory was languid and dreamy, like a gull gliding on an ocean breeze.Messi had already scored twice in the game. But the beauty and impudence of this goal — by some counts, the 656th of Messi's professional career — was clear to all. Betis supporters stood to applaud their tormentor. Soccer pundits reached for celestial metaphors. On ESPN.com, the journalist Musa Okwonga wrote that â€œthe ball, with the glorious inevitability of our slowly dying sun, rose and fell.â€ The wildest exultations came from the operatic English TV commentator Ray Hudson, who unleashed a torrent of mixed metaphors. â€œThe staggering genius of Lionel Messi!â€ he cried, during a live broadcast on the beIN SPORTS network. â€œThis miraculous footballer, this halo of a footballer!â€‰... He's got an algebraic equation to solve in the blink of a baby's eye, and he does it in a way that is just so poetic!â€Hudson is onto something with this talk of algebra and poetry. Messi's greatness lies in his mind as much as his body. Watching replays of the goal, you marvel above all at the audacity of Messi's idea. A chip? From that distance, at that angle, in that frenzied moment of open-field play? It's nuts — a fool's fantasy that blossoms, with every slow-motion replay, into wondrous fact. Messi saw something we didn't even consider.That viral clip is a testament to Messi's supernatural talent. It's also a reminder that online video is changing the way we consume and conceptualize sports. Decades ago, the culture of â€œhighlightsâ€ was already transforming America's pastimes. The decline of slow-paced baseball, the ascendancy of the razzle-dazzle N.B.A., the rule changes that have brought an offensive explosion in the N.F.L. — these developments were fueled in no small part by the rise of ESPN's SportsCenter and the primacy of video clips. But in the old days, those highlight packages were appointment viewing, available only on nightly broadcasts. Today highlights spread across the web in seconds, mutating into memes and turning star athletes into visual brands. You don't have to be a purist to wonder how this media ecosystem is affecting our tolerance for the natural rhythms and longueurs of sports, those lengthy stretches of â€œlowlightâ€ play that are only occasionally punctuated by thrills.Soccer is a subtle game; in general, goals are hard to come by. It would seem to be the major sport most antithetical to highlight culture. (For all those moments of Messi magic, the essence of his greatness may lie in untelegenic maneuverings off the ball, the cagey movements that put him into positions where he can erupt.) But viral video is altering our view of soccer's history. Today's fans compare clips while endlessly debating the â€œgreatest of all timeâ€ status of Messi and his chief rival, the Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo. The GOATs of previous eras — like PelÃ©, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona — recede into the background: They had the misfortune to play in a time before a footballer's every exploit was captured on video. If a player's â€œreceiptsâ€ aren't on YouTube, he's liable to lose to his toehold in the historiography.Yet for the 21st-century soccer fan, online video is a godsend — the only conceivable way to keep up with the ultimate global sport. With a mobile phone and a well-curated social media feed, it is now possible to follow great matches on five different continents, nearly every day, in real time.As for Messi: I know few more pleasurable ways to kill a couple of hours than by squinting at a liquid-crystal screen, bugging out to the likes of â€œLionel Messi Humiliating Players Two or More Times in the Same Play.â€ Messi is the quintessential internet-age soccer star — he scored his first goal for Barcelona in 2005, the year YouTube went online — but his persona is a throwback to an earlier period. He is a trickster and a funnyman, like an old-time silent-movie star. He's small and scrappy, standing just 5-foot-7, the Charlie Chaplin to suave Ronaldo's Rudolph Valentino. Many of his greatest moments play out like slapstick farce, leaving pratfalling defenders littered across the pitch.At their best, sports like soccer are the digital age's most reliable suppliers of an old-fashioned brand of entertainment, the special-effects-free kind, in which human beings use only their sinews and synapses to deliver thrills and spills, action and comedy. Messi's chip in the Betis match was a comedic set piece in its own right. On YouTube, you can find video montages of the play's aftermath: Messi and his teammates celebrating and cracking up, the goalie LÃ³pez mugging like an exasperated vaudeville straight man, play-by-play announcers dissolving in peals of laughter. The goal is a cosmic joke if there ever was one. A small man swings his left leg; a ball loops skyward; common sense and natural laws are suspended. You know the punch line: The ball will fall back to earth, landing — plop — in the back of the net. But no matter how many times you watch it, the gag still kills."
"MUNICH — For Reinhard Grindel, the leader of Germany's soccer federation, this has become an awkward moment to promote his country's campaign to stage European Championship in 2024, or, really, anything having to do with a national team program that only months ago was considered a symbol of unity for the country and one of the most unstoppable forces in sports.Earlier this month, a mob waving German flags and flashing Nazi salutes rampaged through the streets of Chemnitz, in eastern Germany, chasing dark-skinned bystanders as the police, for a time outnumbered, could only watch.After the images were broadcast around the world, they became yet another event for Grindel and the German federation to explain away. For weeks, the federation, known as the D.F.B., has attempted to answer accusations of racism and discrimination stemming from the ugly departure this summer of Mesut Ã–zil, a World Cup-winning playmaker, from the national team after a historically awful performance from the defending world champions in the World Cup.â€œI'm a German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,â€ Ã–zil wrote in a lengthy screed a week after the end of the World Cup, in which Germany finished last in its group, its worst showing since 1938.Now the allegation of bigotry and discrimination from a soccer icon with roots in Germany's sizable Turkish community has become a central focus in Germany's campaign to stage the 2024 Euro, soccer's biggest tournament outside the World Cup. The only opponent — Turkey.Grindel, the 61-year-old bespectacled former politician with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, said Ã–zil's statement represented a low point for him, even lower than the moment South Korea eliminated Germany from the World Cup. Ã–zil had taken aim at Grindel personally, perhaps even more so than the federation he leads.Ã–zil's comments — whether fair or not — represent a fundamental challenge to an image the soccer federation has been keen to cultivate since it successfully played host to the 2006 World Cup. Beginning with that event, the D.F.B. has showcased soccer as a force for racial and religious integration. Twelve years on, if a figure like Ã–zil, heralded as a symbol of integration, could feel compelled to walk out on such terms, what does it say about modern Germany as it seeks to secure its first major tournament since that cheery month of sunshine and soccer 12 years ago?â€œWe all thought sport would be capable of integrating people into society, but it was not true,â€ Gunter Gebauer, a philosopher and expert on sports at the Free University of Berlin, said.Ã–zil's incendiary words came after the player and the federation made a series of missteps. The crisis started in May, before the World Cup, with an ill-advised photo op in London. Ã–zil and a fellow national team player of Turkish descent, Ilkay Gundogan, posed for a photograph with Turkey's authoritarian and nationalist president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day before the provisional German squad was due to be announced.The players faced a severe and immediate backlash. Members of the German media questioned their loyalty to their birth country, while members of the public took to social media to post abusive messages and threats.Joachim LÃ¶w, Germany's national team soccer coach; Oliver Bierhoff, its general manager; and Grindel met to figure out how to manage the crisis. They decided to keep the two players on the squad, with reports saying Grindel had initially wanted Ã–zil barred. The two players then met with Germany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, after the criticism of their meeting with the Turkish leader.Gundogan, who required the services of a psychologist amid the furor, released a statement, explaining his motivations for the meeting. Ã–zil decided not to, after being told by federation officials that the issue was over and that he should concentrate on preparing himself for the World Cup, according to people close to him.Fans jeered the players each time they touched the ball in the team's final tuneup before heading to Russia, and even cheered when Gundogan was fouled by an opponent. Ã–zil's childhood school in Gelsenkirchen, where he has backed programs from children with immigrant backgrounds, canceled a visit he was due to make before the World Cup.Banking on a deep run in Russia, senior federation officials assumed the country would quickly forget those errors. Then came losses to Mexico and South Korea, in which Ã–zil was far from the worst performer on the German roster. But he received plenty of criticism, anyway, for creating a rift within the team, and there were accusations that he didn't play like a German.Though Grindel said in an interview with The New York Times that he did not blame Ã–zil for Germany's World Cup travails, he expected the 29-year-old to clear up the reasons for his meeting with Erdogan. Ã–zil had previously met with Erdogan about a dozen times, with little blowback.â€œThe only thing I asked Mesut for is also to make such a statement, especially bring fans and Mesut together again because my expectation was that he would play in our team also in the future,â€ he said.Cem Ozdemir, one of Germany's most prominent politicians of Turkish descent, said posing with Erdogan â€œwas disrespectful to those who are fined in Turkey or sitting arbitrarily in its prison.â€ Germany has been particularly vocal about the Turkish government's jailing of political campaigners and journalists, including German passport holders.Grindel and German officials have recognized they should have acted more decisively when the controversy first stirred. Instead, they allowed it to engulf the entire federation, and questions of Ã–zil's fidelity to the national cause returned. Then Ã–zil quit, making references to Grindel's comments from his time as a lawmaker in which he appeared to question whether multiculturalism was compatible with integration.â€œMy aim was not to have people separate in one country, everybody can do what they want and no one has contact; there are women living 30 years in Germany and speaking no word in German,â€ Grindel said. â€œMy attitude was to bring people together.â€Katarina Barley, Germany's justice minister, was one of few public figures to offer support to Ã–zil. â€œIt's an alarm signal when a great German footballer like Mesut Ã–zil no longer wants to be in his country because of racism and does not feel represented by the German football board,â€ she said.In Munich, as Germany returned to play its first match since the World Cup against the new champion, France, two weeks ago, shopkeepers on Goethestrasse — a thoroughfare dominated by Turkish-run restaurants, fruit sellers and general stores that sold Turkish and German soccer jerseys side by side — bemoaned the impact Ã–zil's words would have on their lives. They said the comments brought negative scrutiny on the entire Turkish community. Others, like 25-year-old Ali Mahir Zeytinoglu, said Ã–zil was only expressing what many other children of Turkish migrants felt.â€œWe have to respect each other, that's the point,â€ he said. â€œBut the problem is some people don't give you respect.â€Zeytinoglu, born in Munich to Turkish parents, said he felt equally German and Turkish, a sentiment he shares with Ã–zil, who described having two hearts, one that beats for Germany and another for Turkey.Gebauer, the philosopher and sports expert, said, â€œIn Germany, people have extreme difficulty to understand someone can have two passports, two nationalities and be faithful to two countries.â€While Germany remains the favorite to beat Turkey and host the 2024 Euro, bid leaders privately express concerns that even though they believe Ã–zil's claims of racism have no merit, such talk risks making the vote closer than many expect. Turkish politicians and bid officials have brought up the issue several times since the scandal broke.In fact, the fallout from the Ã–zil affair and a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment that has taken root in certain parts of the country after an influx of more than one million Syrian refugees have made hosting the championships more urgent, Bierhoff said.â€œThat's the reason we have to get the European Championship in 2024, to show the world that this country is different,â€ Bierhoff said. â€œOf course, you never get everything the right way, but the majority of people in Germany are different. We have to show this.â€Against France, Gundogan trotted onto the field as a second-half substitute to a mixture of jeers and cheers, a sign of the indignation many continue to feel about that day in May.â€œThis must end now,â€ LÃ¶w said after the match, which ended in a scoreless draw. â€œIf a national team player is jeered, that does not help anyone.â€ LÃ¶w insisted Gundogan supported the values of Germany. â€œHe was born here, his family and friends are here.â€German soccer's commitment to welcoming minorities should not be questioned, Grindel said. He said 50,000 asylum seekers and refugees were registered with one of Germany's 25,000 clubs. The D.F.B. has also invited diversity officers, including the black, Brazilian-born striker known as Cacau, who played in the 2006 World Cup, to meet international media. Cacau said he had never experienced racism in his nearly two decades in Germany.Still, there is little diversity in the upper reaches of the D.F.B. Senior management exhibits little of the modern Germany that bid leaders are so keen to talk about. Those changes may come, but for now the focus is on winning the Euro vote on Sept. 27. Failure isn't an option, especially when the opponent is a bid backed by Turkey's Erdogan.â€œThat would be horrible for the Germans, worse than anything,â€ Gebauer said. â€œI would say Erdogan is the most hated man in Germany.â€"
"MANCHESTER, England — A helicopter belonging to the owner of Leicester City, the English Premier League soccer club, crashed outside the club's stadium on Saturday evening.Initial news media reports suggested that Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the Thai billionaire who bought the team in 2010 and bankrolled its fairy-tale Premier League title win in 2016, was on board, although the authorities did not immediately confirm that. The police said emergency services were â€œdealingâ€ with an incident at the King Power Stadium, and did not say if anybody survived the crash.The crash occurred a little after 8:30 p.m., an hour or so after the end of Leicester's Premier League game against West Ham United.According to Sky News, witnesses reported that the helicopter appeared to develop a problem immediately after takeoff, struggling to clear the roof of the stadium and then spiraling to the ground. It crashed in one of the club's official parking lots adjacent to the stadium.Images and videos posted to social media showed a large fire near the stadium. It was not known if any bystanders were injured.The sight of Srivaddhanaprabha's helicopter landing on the field after games to collect the owner and his entourage and transport them back to London has become a familiar one during his time at the club. His son, Aiyawatt, Leicester's vice chairman, would ordinarily have been among them, but Sky Sports reported that he did not attend the game on Saturday.Srivaddhanaprabha traces his wealth to his King Power International, a company based in Bangkok that operates duty-free shops at airports in Thailand. He opened his first outlet in 1989 and is now thought to have amassed a fortune of some $5 billion. He bought Leicester, then in the second-tier Championship, in 2010 for 39 million pounds, the equivalent of about $50 million.He became an immensely popular figure, thanks in part to regular displays of largess toward fans. He provided free beer and doughnuts at the stadium for the game nearest his birthday. The club also spent tens of thousands of pounds equipping each fan with a â€œclackerâ€ in order to improve atmosphere at the stadium. He regularly flew in Buddhist monks from his native Thailand to bless the field at the King Power Stadium.Most of all, though, it was his role in building the team that won the Premier League — the first title in Leicester's 132-year history — that sealed his place in the city's heart. Leicester had been promoted to English soccer's highest tier in 2014; at the start of the 2015-16 season, bookmakers ranked the team as a 5,000-1 outsider to win the championship.With a team of castoffs from larger clubs and unheralded journeymen, however, Leicester held off the might of Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea to win the title by 10 points. Thousands of fans spilled onto the city's streets to celebrate.Premier League rivals offered their best wishes to Leicester City on Saturday after word of the crash spread. The Manchester City Football Club posted on Twitter: â€œThe thoughts of everyone at Manchester City are with all those at @LCFC following the incident after tonight's match at the King Power Stadium.â€"

"BARCELONA — Barcelona closed in on the La Liga title after beating 10-man Atletico Madrid 2-0 in Saturday's top-of-the-table showdown at the Nou Camp as late strikes by Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi gave the Catalans an 11-point lead at the top of the table.Atletico began brightly but their gameplan went out of the window when Diego Costa was shown a straight red card in the 28th minute for a verbal tirade at referee Jesus Gil Manzano.Atletico produced a gutsy second-half display, expertly shackling Barca, but the Catalans finally found a way past the visitors' outstanding goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a superb curling shot from Suarez in the 85th minute.Moments later Messi sealed victory and quite probably the league title with an irresistibly cool finish into the net and Barca's fans jubilantly chanted ""champions"", crowing at their surely unassailable lead at the top with seven games remaining.Atletico midfielder Koke conceded that Barca had wrapped up the title but questioned the decision to send Costa off.""Barca are practically champions. It was a very strange game, we were doing so well until the red card but all the small details went their way,"" Koke told reporters.""Whenever we come here something strange happens, we've had a lot of red cards against Barca and not all of them have been fair. When you have 10 men against one of the best teams in the world it's normal that it's a struggle.""Suarez highlighted his side's character for winning such a difficult game so soon after their gruelling 4-4 draw against Villarreal in midweek.""This was another game which shows just how hard it is to win the league so we deserve lot more credit for what we're achieving,"" Suarez said.""We've now got a very big advantage over Atletico. There are still some games left but we took two steps towards winning the league today."" MAD MOMENTAtletico realistically needed to win at the Nou Camp for the first time since 2006 to stay in the title race and they played with ambition and intelligence in the opening stages, keeping the ball for long periods and depriving Barca of space.But they were rocked by Costa's moment of madness which killed their early momentum and left them with little choice but to defend for the remaining hour of the game.Striker Costa reacted angrily to not being awarded a foul after being tackled by Jordi Alba and gave a long verbal response to the referee, who to his disbelief pulled out a red card.Costa had to be shepherded off the pitch by Barca's Gerard Pique as he struggled to control his temper while his team mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez earned bookings for venting their anger over the decision. Atletico coped superbly with the setback and numerical disadvantage, controlling the space for the majority of the game.Messi still carved his way through the middle of the pitch on two occasions, creating openings for Suarez and himself but both South American forwards were thwarted by the titanic presence of Oblak.Atletico naturally had limited opportunities down the other end but were not far from finding a goal when Antoine Griezmann picked out Rodrigo from a free kick but the midfielder headed over the bar when Gimenez was stood behind him, in a better position.Diego Simeone's side could not last the distance, however, and as their legs inevitably tired, Barca's attacking quality made the difference.""We knew what the game would be like, Atletico are very organised and after the red card we tried to attack more but it wasn't easy,"" Suarez said.""But we kept going, we showed a great attitude and kept testing their goalkeeper who was the hero of the game.""

"Two days after fans in the United Arab Emirates threw shoes at rival players during a 4-0 loss in the semifinals to Qatar at the Asian Cup, the country's soccer federation has taken direct aim at the team itself.Organizers of the Asian Cup said on Thursday that they would respond to an official complaint lodged by Emirates soccer officials, who charged that two members of the Qatari team were ineligible to play in the region's biggest tournament.The players — Almoez Ali, a Sudan-born striker, and Bassam al-Rawi, a defender born in Iraq — are fixtures in Qatar's lineup. Ali is the tournament's top scorer, with eight goals in six games, and al-Rawi scored the goal that sent Qatar to the quarterfinals.The complaint is the latest salvo in a bitter dispute between the Gulf neighbors that goes far beyond soccer. The Emirates is part of a two-year-old, Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, driven by a belief that its neighbor is financing terrorism and growing too close to Iran, Saudi Arabia's biggest regional rival; Qatar has denied playing any role in supporting terrorist groups.The dispute has already manifested itself in ways small and large in the tournament, which now represents Qatar's biggest success on the soccer field.One consequence of the dispute is that there are no direct flights from Doha to Abu Dhabi, so Qatar's team had to fly through Oman on its way to the event, and Qatari fans — unable to travel to the Emirates without permission — are largely absent at the team's matches.But Qatar, which has never qualified for a World Cup but will host the event in 2022, has been the surprise of the field. It will play Japan in the final on Friday.But even as Qatar marched through the field, rumors — fueled by a close reading of FIFA nationality rules — swirled about the eligibility of Ali and al-Rawi.The silence of Qatari officials on the issue has only led to more rumors. A spokesman for the team has not responded to repeated requests for comment, while FIFA, the global governing body for soccer, has said the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the tournament organizer, the Asian Football Confederation.The A.F.C. had said that it would intervene only an official complaint were filed. That complaint arrived in the aftermath of the Emirates' humiliating defeat in front of its own fans in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.â€œThe Asian Football Confederation has a received a protest from the United Arab Emirates F.A. regarding the eligibility of two Qatar players,â€ the A.F.C. said in a statement on Thursday. â€œThis protest will now be reviewed in line with the A.F.C. regulations.â€The A.F.C. declined to identify the possible punishment for Qatar. Teams that have previously fielded ineligible players have forfeited games, but the situation has never come up at the final stages of a major international event.Under soccer's regulations, players are only eligible for a national team outside of their country of birth if they have lived there for five continuous years after turning 18. Al-Rawi is 21 and Ali is 22. The rules make an exception that permits players to represent a country if a parent or grandparent was born there; many countries, including the United States, regularly take advantage of the exception.Qatar has been trawling the world for talent for years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup, embarking on perhaps the most extensive talent identification program in history, one that involved the creation of training programs for youngsters from Africa and an academy for the best prospects in Doha.Officials in the country have said in the past that the program does not require those scouted to pick Qatar over their birth countries. Though born in Sudan, Ali has lived in Qatar since he was a child. Al-Rawi's father once represented Iraq internationally.Still, Qatar's squads at the youth and senior levels have included several expatriate players, and the eligibility was not questioned when Ali and al-Rawi represented the country at previous tournaments sanctioned by FIFA and the A.F.C.It was not clear why the Emirates, or any of Qatar's other opponents — including Saudi Arabia, which lost to Qatar, 2-0 — did not raise the issue until after the semifinal.The victories over the Saudis and the Emirates were greeted by scenes of jubilation in Qatar, where fans draped in the country's flag took to the streets of Doha to celebrate the victories.For the hosts, the defeat was particularly painful given the efforts it had made to create a partisan atmosphere inside Abu Dhabi's Zayed Sports City Stadium. Local organizers distributed thousands of free tickets to what it described as â€œloyalâ€ fans before the game.For the A.F.C., the issue also raises another political issue. Its president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, is being challenged for his post by candidates from the Emirates and Qatar.The organization has opened a separate investigation over the shoe- and bottle-throwing incidents that marred the semifinal. That case could lead to sanctions."
"Don Garber, who in two decades as commissioner has overseen a wave of expansion that has more than doubled the size of Major League Soccer, has signed a five-year contract extension that will keep him in charge of the league through the 2023 season.The league announced the new contract on Thursday. Garber's previous deal expired after last season, but he had widely been expected to remain in his post. Garber, 61, also will continue in his role as the chairman of Soccer United Marketing, the league's powerful — and profitable — marketing arm.A former N.F.L. executive, Garber was recruited to join M.L.S. by the N.F.L. owners Robert Kraft and Lamar Hunt, who also owned teams in the then-fledgling soccer league.Garber took over a 12-team M.L.S. in August 1999, and among his first moves was to close the league's two Florida franchises, in Tampa Bay and Miami. The decision reduced the league's roster to 10 teams and raised questions about its viability as a national league.But in the two decades that followed, Garber led the league on a wave of expansion — first two teams in 2005, and then a steady flow of at least one new team a year from 2007 to 2012. That burst of growth included the additions of three teams in Canada, in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.All the while, he tinkered with the league's roster and salary rules, recruited global stars like David Beckham and persuaded the owners to invest in player development and new stadiums. M.L.S. had one soccer-specific stadium in 1999; by this summer, 20 of its teams will play in facilities they control.Garber's tenure has not been trouble-free. Critics point to the league's centralized control of player contracts and Soccer United Marketing's influence with U.S. Soccer as hampering the growth of the domestic game, and Garber once openly feuded with the former United States national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann after the coach criticized the league.But there is little question that Garber's tenure has transformed the league. The league now has national sponsors and television contracts that bring its games to 170 countries. Twenty-four teams will play in M.L.S. this year, including a new one in Cincinnati, and three more ownership groups have been approved to enter the league by 2021.One of them, led by Beckham, will bring the league back to the Miami market it once abandoned."
"LONDON — FIFA acknowledged this week that its computer systems were hacked earlier this year for the second time, and officials from European soccer's governing body fear they also might have suffered a data breach.The hack on FIFA, world soccer's governing body, occurred in March and is not thought to be connected to a cyberattack orchestrated by a group linked to Russia's intelligence agency in 2017. That incident led to the publication of a list of failed drug tests by soccer players.The information that was compromised in the second cyberattack on FIFA is not yet clear, but a consortium of European media organizations plans to publish a series of stories based in part on the internal documents as early as Friday. The group Football Leaks originally obtained the documents.UEFA officials were targeted in a so-called phishing operation in which third parties fool their targets into giving up password-protected login details, though the organization has been unable to find traces of a hack in its computer systems.In recent weeks, both FIFA and UEFA have received hundreds of questions, including several related to information contained in confidential documents. FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, was UEFA's most senior administrator before being elected to lead global soccer in 2016.FIFA officials discussed the prospect of a new hack, and more uncomfortable revelations in the news media, on the edges of the FIFA Council meeting last week in Kigali, Rwanda.Information published by Football Leaks has rattled global soccer since 2015, when stolen documents emerged on a specially created website. Since the initial leak, a trove of emails, contracts and private messages have been obtained exclusively by the German weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel. Der Spiegel has sought to deal with the volume of information it received by sharing it with an investigative reporting consortium called European Investigative Collaborations.The leaks have uncovered some of soccer's biggest secrets, shining light on dubious practices that have led to tougher regulations in soccer and in some cases, criminal prosecutions. FIFA earlier this year announced planned changes to the $6 billion transfer market, in part as a response to dealing unveiled by Football Leaks, and Spanish authorities have successfully prosecuted top players and coaches for tax evasion.Most recently, information obtained from the leak led to articles in Der Spiegel that revealed the details of a nondisclosure agreement Cristiano Ronaldo signed with a Las Vegas woman who accused the Portuguese star of sexually assaulting her in 2009. Ronaldo has denied the charges and, though his lawyers, threatened to sue the magazine.A coordinator with E.I.C. said he could not comment on the content of the next batch of articles, or even if any would be published. FIFA issued a statement criticizing the leaks of stolen information.â€œFIFA condemns any attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in any organization using unlawful practices,â€ FIFA said.Asked about the leaks, Infantino said he had tried to do his work honestly. That has meant having discussions and sharing ideas and documents with numerous people, he added.â€œIf then this is being portrayed as something bad then I think there's not much I can do other than my job,â€ he said during a conversation in Kigali last week. â€œWe are not stealing.â€Details of the person or group behind Football Leaks were presented in a book written by two reporters from Der Spiegel and published earlier this year. The group told the authors that its aim is to cleanse world soccer by exposing bad actors.Football Leaks is not the only major data breach that has roiled soccer, or global sports. In October, the United States Department of Justice announced charges against seven Russian intelligence officers who it said had successfully compromised the networks of organizations including FIFA and The International Olympic Committee.And for most of the past year, confidential emails belonging to the Portuguese club Benfica have surfaced on the internet. Those leaks have highlighted how the club has tried to influence senior figures in soccer and forged close links to officials responsible for refereeing. Benfica has denied wrongdoing and sought Google's help in identifying those who have republished the documents."
"LONDON — Standing outside the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar, Ali Demirci pointed, proudly, to the fresh paint on the window frame. Its color was one of those on-trend grays from an upscale catalog, with a name like Elephant's Breath or Slipper Satin. â€œThe club came and did it,â€ Demirci said. He glanced upward to the other minor alteration to the shop he owned until a few weeks ago: a bright white sign. â€œBut I installed that myself.â€On the other side of the road, the change has been rather more drastic. The window seats at the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar now offer a view of the gleaming glass frontage of the $1 billion, state-of-the-art stadium that — starting Wednesday evening, when it hosts its inaugural Premier League game — Tottenham Hotspur will call home.The territory is, of course, familiar: The new stadium is on the same patch of land as the atmospheric, historic, old White Hart Lane, where Spurs played for 118 years. The horizon, though, is different: the club hopes the new stadium represents not just a great leap forward for Spurs — proof, in concrete and steel, that this team belongs among Europe's pre-eminent powers — but for English soccer as a whole.Chris Lee, its chief architect, said he had looked at some 300 stadiums around the world for inspiration and incorporated the best elements he could find into what he labeled the â€œbestâ€ stadium on the planet: an arena supposed to be more modern than Wembley, sleeker than Old Trafford, bigger (crucially) than Arsenal's home at the Emirates. It is supposed to set what Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, described as a â€œnew standardâ€ for sports stadiums.The arena's centerpiece is the biggest single-tier stand in England, capable of holding 17,500 fans, modeled on Borussia Dortmund's SÃ¼dtribune — known, more commonly, as the Yellow Wall. It claims to be home to the longest bar in Europe. It has a retractable field, allowing it to host not only Premier League matches but N.F.L. games, too. It has its own microbrewery and a restaurant run by a Michelin-starred chef. And, in what is surely a first for a soccer team, Spurs will have its own on-site sommelier.The appeal for Levy and the club, of course, is the financial boost all of that can bring: more fans, spending more time and more money, all of it flowing straight into the team's coffers. Levy said Tuesday that, with the extra revenue generated by the stadium, Spurs' income would be in the world's top 10.This is a team that has long had to wheel and deal in the transfer market. On Sunday, the club's manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted he and his staff had laughed at the sight of Naby Keita and Fabinho, Â£100 million worth of talent combined, on Liverpool's bench when the teams met, representing a luxury way beyond Spurs' means. Tottenham's new home is, in time, supposed to change that, to turn Spurs into a club that can compete with the elite not just on the field, but off it.The effects of the stadium, though, will resonate beyond Spurs' balance sheet. The club has long claimed it can be a â€œcatalystâ€ for the regeneration of the neighborhood around it. At a news media presentation on Tuesday, the club's executive director, Donna Cullen, opened with a photograph of a burning car: a reminder of the riots that scarred the area — before spreading across the capital and the country — in 2011.That hot, angry summer, Cullen said, was the â€œtriggerâ€ for Spurs to think about what it could do to improve not only its own horizons, but those of the place it represents. The area around Tottenham, Haringey, is the fifth-most deprived borough in London, she said: The club was taken over by a spirit of â€œlet's see what we can do.â€The local authority, Haringay Council, does not entirely accept the idea that Tottenham's rebirth rests on the stadium. Charles Adje, the councilor responsible for regeneration, said he would not use the word â€œcatalystâ€ himself, but he acknowledged that it â€œadds value to the area.â€Both the club and the council project that the new stadium could pour around Â£293 million a year into the local economy; Spurs estimated that it would be responsible for more than 1,700 jobs. â€œThis stadium and this new club is going to make a massive, massive difference to the people of Tottenham,â€ David Lammy, Tottenham's member of Parliament, said this week.That, too, will take time, of course. So far, the main visible differences to Tottenham High Road are the new facades on the sandwich bar, the convenience store and a handful of other properties across from the stadium. The streets running to and from it are, otherwise, much the same as always: a jumble of jerk chicken places and nail bars, Polish supermarkets and tumbledown mechanics.Smoking a cigarette outside the barbershop he has run for 25 years, Inan Gulecyuz said he was happy to wait. The stadium opening is, technically, bad news for him: Business drops on game days, he said, and with soccer and the N.F.L. to fit in, he will lose a little trade.That will, he hopes, be offset by the benefits it will bring. â€œThey have changed a lot of the shops just up the road,â€ he said. â€œHopefully the same thing will happen down the road, too.â€A little further from the stadium, Irfan Sahin was serving coffee in Fieldseat, his delicatessen, cafÃ©, bookshop and organic food market. Soft classical music played overhead.Sahin said that he expected the stadium to alter the character of the area, to encourage more businesses to open — â€œThere is no other Michelin-starred restaurant in north London,â€ he noted — but then, he said, Tottenham is changing anyway: In London, gentrification is a constant tide, regardless of where soccer clubs play.â€œIt is very different from when I first came here in 2001,â€ he said. â€œIt is slow, of course: We had two gang fights right outside in the last year or so. But there are more places opening all of the time: bars and pubs and cafÃ©s and restaurants. It is not as expensive as central London, or as expensive as east London, so it is a good place to open. Hopefully it will be better with the stadium.â€Academic literature is unclear on whether that will hold true. Writing in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2000, John Siegfried and Andrew Zimbalist concluded — based largely on case studies in the United States — that while â€œteam owners have argued that sports facilities boost local economic activity, economic reasoning and empirical evidence suggest the opposite.â€There are those in Tottenham, certainly, who feel disenfranchised by the speed of change and by redevelopment proposals backed by the council and the club. â€œThere is a real risk of companies going out of business if we cannot find alternative locations in the neighborhood,â€ said Feruk Tepeyurt, the owner of a local joinery firm and chairman of the Peacock Industrial Estate, home to more than 50 small businesses but, under both the council's plans and a separate project proposed by the club, scheduled to become a park. â€œDo we need a park, or do we need a community of small businesses, a lot of them run by local, black and minority ethnic people?â€That is the tension inherent in any regeneration, of course: the issue of who, precisely, it is supposed to work for, of whose needs it is meeting. â€œThere is a thin dividing line between seeing the stadium as a catalyst for regeneration and a Trojan horse for social cleansing,â€ said Mark Panton, an academic at Birkbeck College who has written extensively on the dispute.There is one change left to come: Transport for London, the capital's transit authority, is expected to accept a proposal to rename White Hart Lane, the nearest train station to the stadium, to Tottenham Hotspur.It is not unprecedented — Arsenal has had its own tube stop, dating to the 1930s — but nor is it universally popular. The objection is based on the idea that erasing the station's name wipes clean a century or so of history; that it needlessly, ham-fistedly conflates the identities of Tottenham the area and Tottenham the team; that it creates the impression, deep down, below the fresh coats of paint, that the place exists to serve the club, rather than the club existing to reflect the place."
"MIAMI — When David Beckham, the former captain of England's national team, announced his intention to bring a Major League Soccer team to South Florida at a rousing event in downtown Miami five years ago, the excitement was palpable.â€œI remember thinking how amazing it was going to be,â€ said Cesar Molero, who runs a fan club named Vice City 1896.When Beckham returned last year for a similar event, where he and many M.L.S. executives were joined by a group of deep-pocketed local investors, there were new plans, new promises and new colors on the scarves.By September, Beckham's expansion team had a new name (Inter Miami) and a new logo (with twin herons). By January, its new team president had put together the core of a technical staff.And on Wednesday, M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber confirmed what he had been saying for months: that he has the â€œutmost confidenceâ€ that Beckham's group will produce a team that is a worthy successor to recent M.L.S. start-ups in Atlanta and Los Angeles.But just over a year before Inter Miami is set to take the field for the first time, its road is not without obstacles. Battles in the courtroom and with powerful residents of South Florida have blocked its progress more than once. The team is working on its fifth potential stadium site, with no assurances that this one will be the last, and is facing multiple lawsuits seeking to block the club's right to acquire the property.Even the most passionate followers of the team — who are united more around an idea than anything tangible — have been pulled in different directions. The cause of their split is the most basic of disputes: They disagreed over what their group should be called.The original fan group — known as the Southern Legion — was also the largest, with more than 400 dues-paying members. But last year it sought to rename itself The Siege.â€œWe felt a change was appropriate once we saw the crest,â€ said Max Ramos, a founding member of the Southern Legion. â€œA group of herons is called a siege. It felt right.â€Those who felt otherwise split off and kept the original name. Ramos insisted there were no hard feelings. The amicable split, he said, is a sign of the camaraderie that has helped fans remain steadfast in their dedication to Beckham's grand, but at times excruciatingly fluid, plan.There is no turning back at this point, anyway. Last year, Beckham and his new group of well-financed, well-connected investors were finally granted the rights to an expansion place in the league. Satisfied that doubts about a stadium plan and the Beckham group's resources and local commitment had been resolved, the commissioner confirmed that the team would enter M.L.S. in the 2020 season.The matter of where it will make that debut, however, is a bit more complicated.Inter Miami has been the focus of a stream of legal action in recent months, with issues including an ethics complaint related to the owners' political lobbying, disputes about the feasibility of building a stadium on its preferred site and the legality of public votes on the matter.Thwarted at several downtown locations, the team now has its sights on creating Miami Freedom Park, a $1 billion complex spread over 160 acres at Melreese Country Club, a city-owned golf course near Miami International Airport. Critics have ridiculed the proposal as a real estate deal with a 25,000-seat soccer stadium included, but a larger problem may lurk underneath the golf course: Last July, it was revealed that it sits atop a toxic waste dump.â€œThere are so many holes in their plans — it's unreal,â€ said David Winker, a Florida-based lawyer who has filed two lawsuits against Beckham's franchise in the past five months.Winker described himself as a soccer fan eager to take his family to matches when the team begins play — Florida International University could serve as a temporary home while the legal fights continue — but not, he said, at any cost.â€œI was immediately suspicious of how the deal was being conducted — behind closed-door negotiations and in a frantic rush,â€ Winker added, calling it â€œjust a terrible way to introduce a new sports team to Miami.â€Still, in November, it appeared that Beckham, his ownership group and M.L.S. had finally cleared the last hurdle. Amid songs, drumbeats and free paella on Election Day, Beckham and his new partners — including Jose and Jorge Mas, the Miami-based construction magnates; Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese owner of SoftBank; Marcelo Claure, the former chief executive of Sprint telecommunications; and the pop-music mogul Simon Fuller — celebrated victory in a public referendum that had granted them the right to enter into a noncompete bidding process for the Melreese property.Just 24 hours later, however, those negotiations were frozen because of an ethics complaint filed by Winker after he noticed that of all the people who spoke on behalf of the project before the city commission that will decide its fate, none had properly registered as a lobbyist. Those speakers included the aunt of the commission's chairman, Keon Hardemon.Although the Miami-Dade County ethics commission issued a letter last month advising that the negotiations over a 99-year lease on the golf course site could move forward while an investigation continued, problems persist.Winker filed a lawsuit in which he argued that city documents provided an unclear land description, and that the city should be prohibited from using the referendum as authorization to negotiate a no-bid lease. Ordinarily, he said, that type of sale would be open to bids.A separate lawsuit by Bruce C. Matheson, a wealthy landowner in South Florida, also took aim at the referendum. Matheson had previously filed suit to block a stadium planned for the Overtown neighborhood of Miami, near where he owns property.â€œEach plan seems more convoluted than the last,â€ Matheson said this month.Victoria Mendez, the city's lawyer, told The Miami Herald last month that the actions filed by Winker and Matheson did not â€œdepict a clear understanding of our codes.â€ M.L.S. continues to express its support; in November, Garber hailed the victory in the stadium referendum as â€œa historic day for the sport in our country.â€Inter Miami, meanwhile, is plowing ahead.â€œThe baseless and frivolous lawsuits/complaints will not deter any of our efforts and focus,â€ Jorge Mas wrote in an email. â€œThese are sideshows and a nonissue to our plan.â€Beckham, who is based in London, has placed confidence in his local partners to navigate the political and legal waters of South Florida.The team's fans appear to be doing the same.â€œOnce we begin playing next year,â€ said Ramos, the Siege leader, â€œeverything else will be forgotten.â€"
"LONDON — Confronted with what they consider a power play by a group of wealthy soccer clubs to promote the Champions League at the expense of national championships, representatives of Europe's domestic leagues will meet in Lisbon this week to discuss a strategy to protect what they say is decades of tradition, and a basic sense of fairness.What the leagues fear, several officials said, is what they consider a behind-the-scenes campaign to reshape European soccer for the exclusive benefit of the continent's biggest clubs. The leagues contend the proposed changes to the Champions League, which include new barriers to entry for nonelite clubs and schedule changes that would push matches onto weekend dates, will diminish the relevance and marketability of domestic leagues, and potentially render many of their matches irrelevant.At this week's Lisbon meeting, an annual gathering of the umbrella European Leagues group, members will discuss plans to fight back — perhaps even in court — against suggested changes that they argue will adversely affect the competitions that still form the cultural and financial backbone of the global soccer industry. The coalition of leagues is a diverse group — leagues from Portugal to Ukraine are members — but a potentially formidable one given the influence and resources of members like England's Premier League, Germany's Bundesliga and Spain's La Liga.â€œThe association of European Leagues is raising its voice and the leagues are cohesive more than ever in the defense and protection of domestic football,â€ said Alberto Colombo, the deputy general secretary of the European league body, in an interview.While representatives of the continent's richest and most powerful clubs and European soccer's governing body, UEFA, say any discussions for reforming club competitions like the Champions League remain in their infancy, league officials have grown increasingly concerned about details of the proposed changes that have started to leak.The most dramatic include reducing the size of national leagues and altering their schedules to allow European games to be played on weekends, a window historically reserved for domestic matches. The Bundesliga's chief executive called weekend Champions League matches a â€œred lineâ€ that could not be crossed. English officials similarly declared the idea a nonstarter.â€œIt is the role of the Premier League and other English football organizations to govern the format of league and cup competitions in this country,â€ the Premier League spokesman Nick Noble said. â€œIt would be wholly inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structure of domestic English football.â€Other proposals would see access to the Champions League itself severely restricted, with only 8 of 32 participants allowed to earn their places through success in domestic competition the previous season. The other 24 places would be reserved for teams already in the Champions League, or a handful of participants from a second-tier European club competition.Andrea Agnelli, the president of Juventus, who leads the powerful European Club Association, said at that group's annual meeting in Amsterdam last week that it would be at least a year before any changes would be finalized, and he refused to discuss details of proposals already under discussion. However, in an interview with The Guardian last year, he described reforms he would like to see that appear to be similar to those currently under discussion.While the E.C.A. represents more than 200 clubs from across Europe, it is increasingly dominated by a handful of the largest teams. That group includes the likes of Juventus and Bayern Munich but also heavyweights from Spain and England like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Those clubs have for years used their might — and threats to break away and form an exclusive competition outside the current domestic league structure — to wrest concessions from soccer's leaders.Javier Tebas, the frequently outspoken head of Spain's top league, said the proposal to restructure continental competitions for the benefit of the small group of rich clubs that already dominate them would spell doom for soccer in large parts of Europe. The changes would, Tebas said, allow the wealthiest clubs to widen the massive talent and resource gap they already enjoy, and tear away the fabric of the sport's traditions.Playing European competition matches on the weekend, in particular, would be â€œa recipe for the demise of football across Europe,â€ Tebas said in a statement. The Bundesliga's chief executive, Christian Seifert, concurred in a speech earlier this year.â€œThe weekend must belong to the national leagues,â€ Seifert said. â€œThey are the heart and soul of professional football.â€Access to the Champions League is currently linked to performance in domestic leagues, but under one set of proposals that could change drastically, with most participating teams allowed to compete year after year regardless of their league positions. In one plan, Europe's top 32 teams would be divided into four groups of eight teams, with the top four each season advancing to a knockout round to determine the winner.Such a change would dramatically reduce the attractiveness of national leagues for broadcasters, where the battle to qualify for European club competitions has long been part of the narrative sold to television companies. At times, in fact, the battle for Champions League positions has often been more compelling than the race for the title, which in some countries is often wrapped up months before the end of the campaign.Agnelli hinted that, in the future, qualification could be based on success within European competitions — a setup that would maximize places for teams already in, and serve as a significant barrier to clubs trying to break in.â€œIt is certainly something that is logical,â€ he said when asked if teams could be promoted or relegated within a closed European system. The proposals could transform soccer's top club competition into one that resembles a similar event in European basketball, where 11 of the 16 teams in the EuroLeague are guaranteed spots regardless of their domestic performances.For the biggest clubs, a closed-off Champions League would offer financial certainty. But the leagues are vowing to defend a structure that currently allows any team the opportunity to win — on the field — a place among the giants.â€œThe leagues defend the basic values of the European sport model, based on sporting merits, an open-access pyramid structure where all clubs form the foundation and all clubs could live the dream to reach the top,â€ said Colombo, of the European league body.While the top clubs have forged close links to UEFA thanks to a deepening friendship between Agnelli, the E.C.A. leader, and UEFA's president, Aleksander Ceferin, the leagues — faced with a critical leadership void at a vital moment — have struggled to present a cohesive opposing voice. The Premier League, for example, remains without a leader after stumbling in its search for a replacement for its longtime chief executive Richard Scudamore, who retired last year. And Lars-Christer Olsson, the chairman of the European League body, has only recently recovered from a serious illness."
"LONDON — Susanna Dinnage, a senior executive at Discovery Communications, was named the next chief executive of the Premier League on Tuesday, a position that will make her one of the most prominent women in professional sports.Dinnage will replace the Premier League's departing executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, who is stepping down by the end of the year after nearly two decades leading the organization. Scudamore's job will be split in two in a new structure, the league said, with Dinnage as chief executive alongside a nonexecutive chairman.With Scudamore at the helm, the Premier League grew into a sporting goliath. It is by far the most popular domestic league in world soccer, generating global television rights income worth more than 3 billion pounds each season.The team of five people appointed by the league to hire Scudamore's replacement had managed to keep their preference for Dinnage a secret until Tuesday, when they convened a special meeting of the league's 20 teams to announce her as their preference. Dinnage, whose broad experience in broadcasting and digital media appealed to the Premier League's search team, joins an industry where women in leadership positions continue to be the exception rather than the rule.The only other female leader of one of soccer's top leagues is Nathalie Boy de la Tour, the president of France's Ligue de Football Professionnel. FIFA, soccer's governing body, appointed the former United Nations official Fatma Samoura as its secretary general in 2016.â€œWe had a very strong field, but Susanna was the outstanding choice given her track record in managing complex businesses through transformation and digital disruption,â€ said Bruce Buck, the chairman of Chelsea F.C., who led the league's nominations committee. Dinnage, who has been with Discovery for the past decade, most recently led Animal Planet, one of the company's biggest channels.The Premier League has prospered since its inception in the early 1990s on the strength of record-breaking television contracts, and as the beneficiary of bidding competitions in which cable and satellite providers around the world repeatedly drove up the price to acquire the rights to broadcast its matches. Dinnage arrives at the Premier League amid a time of great change, however; with media consumption habits changing, she will be charged with figuring out a strategy to keep the money flowing as consumption of Premier League matches — in Britain, but also in places as far afield as Bangkok and Boston — increasingly shifts to online platforms.In two decades at the Premier League, Scudamore managed to keep the competition together amid rising tension between its richest teams — wealthy northern clubs like Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool, and the London powerhouses Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham — and the rest. The most powerful clubs' battle for a greater slice of league revenue will most likely intensify in the coming years, as will new threats. This month, for example, leaked documents obtained by a consortium of European news media groups showed that some of the continent's top teams, including Premier League giants like United and Liverpool, had been involved in discussions about a possible breakaway competition.Dinnage's tasks will also include figuring out a way of keeping the Premier League, one of Britain's biggest international success stories, prospering if the country follows through on plans to exit the European Union. British soccer leaders, like those from most other industries, have expressed great concern about the impact of Brexit on their operations, with particular concerns about player recruitment and television rights sales.Dinnage will not assume her new role until 2019, the league said, as her start date will depend on coming talks with Discovery. But Discovery's president, J. B. Perrette, endorsed her for the new role.â€œShe has been a fantastic teammate for all of us at Discovery and we are delighted that she has been given this unique and groundbreaking opportunity to lead one of the world's pre-eminent sports organizations,â€ Perrette said in a statement released by the league."
"ATLANTA — In the adolescent years of Major League Soccer, its championship game did not always feel like a spectacle. In those days, the M.L.S. Cup was held at neutral sites before most teams had fan bases willing to travel en masse, and the pockets of empty seats and the mosaic of random jerseys in the stadiums didn't exactly create a sense of grandeur.It would be hard to imagine a bigger contrast, then, with what is now being promised in Saturday night's 23rd M.L.S. Cup, when the Portland Timbers will visit Atlanta United with the league title at stake. M.L.S., which stopped using neutral sites for its final after the 2011 game, could hardly have drawn up a better setting: the league's two top teams — and its past two most valuable players — squaring off inside the year-old Mercedes-Benz Stadium, its stands packed with more than 70,000 fans wearing the colors of a brash, second-year team that has jolted the league with both its style of play and its next-generation (for M.L.S., at least) business model.â€œIt's going to be incredible,â€ said Arthur Blank, who owns both Atlanta United and its gleaming new arena. â€œFor our fans. Really, for soccer in North America.â€Adding to the atmosphere will be the fact that about 2,000 Timbers supporters are expected to be on hand as well, making them the largest traveling contingent for a final that many in the league can remember. Many of the Timbers supporters will have traveled from the opposite corner of the country this week, ready to give full-throated reminders to their hosts that they have been singing chants and winning games — and trophies — since before Atlanta United existed.For a league always striving to carve out a bigger stake in the American sports landscape, this moment — two of M.L.S.'s most popular and successful teams meeting on what is unquestionably the league's biggest stage — is an exquisite bit of serendipity.â€œIt is not often that a league can celebrate a leading goal-scorer of all-time, an M.V.P., a record-setting fan base, and just clutter-breaking excitement with one team in one market,â€ the M.L.S. commissioner, Don Garber, said in an interview this week.Atlanta enters the final as a heavy favorite, and for reasons obvious to anyone who followed the league this season. It finished two points shy of the top record in the league, the product of a fluid and aggressively attacking style instilled by its Argentine coach, Gerardo Martino. It features the league's top player, Josef MartÃ­nez, the Venezuelan striker who won M.V.P. honors this week after smashing the league's single-season goals record with 31 this season, as well as a teammate who could soon prove even more valuable: the gifted Paraguayan midfielder Miguel AlmirÃ³n, who could soon break the league's transfer record if a whispered move to the Premier League goes through in January.On the other side of the field is a Portland team that, while it may not be able to match Atlanta's average attendance numbers (figures that, the league boasts often, fall somewhere between the crowds at home games for Liverpool and Manchester City) or roster spending, has long been a darling of M.L.S. The Timbers, the 2015 M.L.S. champions, have sold out their stadium for every home game since joining the league in 2011.â€œWhile I'm incredibly excited by what's going on in Atlanta,â€ Garber said, â€œthey're playing against a team in Portland that has had that approach from the very beginning.â€Regardless of how Saturday's match goes, Portland has already claimed a social media victory this week; on Sunday, it tweaked Atlanta United on Twitter after catching the newcomers using a file photo of Portland's 2015 championship trophy to promote the game.And as it did in its 2015 run, Portland has proved to be a tough opponent on the road this postseason. Led by the 2017 M.V.P., Diego Valeri, it has scored seven goals in three games away from Providence Park in the postseason. And while the first-year Portland coach Giovanni Savarese might not have the international pedigree of Martino, who previously coached Barcelona and Argentina's national team, he is in his sixth final in seven years after making five in his last job, with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League.When the two teams played to a 1-1 draw in June, Portland deployed an extra defender to slow MartÃ­nez and AlmirÃ³n, and Martino said Friday that he expected a similar dynamic in the final.â€œWe as a team expect to have the initiative, and we expect Portland to cede that to us,â€ Martino said through a translator during a conference call on Monday. â€œSo we plan to be aggressive.â€There are contrasts off the field, too, despite both clubs' reputations for large and dedicated fan bases — something not every M.L.S. team can boast. Portland has benefited from a rich local soccer history, dating to the Timbers' roots as an N.A.S.L. team in the 1970s. Atlanta seems to have burst out of nowhere — a result of careful planning since the franchise's founding and a focus on nurturing the team's fan culture long before the squad's first player was signed.Through different paths, it has all added up — for both teams — to something M.L.S. has long sought: true resonance in their respective cities. That is not lost on the players who have been part of it.â€œThe game itself is going to be special because, I think, it's going to have a sparkling atmosphere, you know?â€ said the veteran Atlanta defender Jeff Larentowicz, who is playing in his fifth M.L.S. Cup. â€œIn the past, it hasn't always been that way.â€"
"Not so long ago the idea of merely setting foot in the United States would have filled FIFA's leaders with dread. The idea of holding an important meeting there would have been rejected as absurd.That was because a sprawling corruption indictment by the United States Department of Justice in 2015 had threatened the very existence of FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. The investigation had produced the dawn arrests of more than a dozen top power brokers in the sport and eventually led to the ouster of some of the organization's most powerful figures. It left others fearful of traveling to the United States for any reason, lest they risk being picked up by the authorities.Yet this week, almost four years later, FIFA is bringing the members of its governing council — a body that, in an earlier incarnation, was accused by the American authorities of engaging in graft schemes dating back decades — to United States soil for the first time since the scandal broke. The 37-member body, an expanded group now known as the FIFA Council, will hold a meeting in Miami on Friday to discuss, among other things, a significant expansion of the 2022 World Cup and a multibillion-dollar plan for a new World Cup-style competition for clubs.The site of the meeting, FIFA says, is the latest sign that it has moved on from its corrupt past.â€œIt's probably fair to say that there is a symbolic significance for the FIFA Council to meet in the U.S.A. for the first time since 2015,â€ FIFA, which is based in Zurich, said in a statement.Four years ago, images of police officers leading soccer officials out of a luxury Swiss hotel in two separate dawn raids gripped the sporting world, unleashing a crisis that has cost FIFA millions of dollars and led to years of turmoil. Dozens of soccer officials, businessmen and companies have since pleaded guilty to charges in United States courts; others are fighting extradition; and two men, including the former head of South American soccer, were jailed after a 2017 trial in New York. The crisis also led to the ouster of a number of executives not named in the indictments, including FIFA's longtime president at the time, Joseph S. Blatter.While there is little sign another blockbuster raid is in the offing, United States authorities' interest in FIFA has not dimmed. Multiple defendants who have pleaded guilty in the case have not yet been sentenced, with prosecutors again agreeing this year to push back decisions about the punishments of at least five people, including an Argentine businessman who testified at the New York trial and has served as a key cooperating witness.â€œFIFA remains ready to assist public authorities in all cases and, while the experience was difficult, we are finally very grateful that the U.S. Department of Justice intervened when it did to address some serious governance problems and, in so doing, help put FIFA on the path to reform,â€ its statement added.The current leadership has attempted to build bridges with the American authorities. FIFA's top legal official, the deputy secretary general Alasdair Bell, made it a priority to visit Brooklyn and meet with prosecutors upon joining the soccer body in September. His visit came a month after FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, met with President Trump at the White House.Such trips were considered perilous four years ago. Blatter and his former No. 2, JÃ©rÃ´me Valcke, who faces a separate corruption investigation in Switzerland, skipped the Women's World Cup when it was held in Canada in the summer of 2015, only weeks after the first raids in Switzerland. Other officials also have stayed safely out of reach.FIFA has not confirmed whether any council members will skip next week's meeting, though at least one may not travel, according to a person familiar with the council member's thinking.Coming to Miami also renews focus on Concacaf, the regional confederation that governs soccer in North and Central America and Caribbean. Based in the city, Concacaf is one of soccer's six regional governing bodies, but it perhaps felt the most damage from the scandal: three of its former presidents were charged by United States authorities, and an internal probe later found multiple examples of rogue behavior, including self-dealing, indiscriminate use of private jets and even the recruitment of a private detective to snoop on individuals, including the former U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati, who still sits on the FIFA Council.Concacaf, which  nearly closed amid a banking crisis brought on by the Justice Department case, is largely prospering after introducing governance reforms. It has also changed headquarters, moving from a location in Miami Beach that was the target of F.B.I. raids in 2015 to a new office in the city's business district.Its current president, Victor Montagliani of Canada, said Concacaf had â€œlong turned the pageâ€ on its existential crisis.â€œHaving FIFA come to Miami for the first time since the events of 2015 marks a momentum forward for world football,â€ he said, â€œand we are glad to play our part.â€While its worst days may have passed, global soccer continues to be dogged by sporadic episodes of unethical behavior by senior figures. A Ghanaian member of the FIFA Council, Kwesi Nyantakyi, received a lifetime ban last year after being caught on camera accepting thousands of dollars in cash from an undercover reporter. And last week, another council member, Lee Harmon of the Cook Islands, received a three-month ban for the illegal resale of tickets to last year's World Cup in Russia.To Miguel Maduro, a former governance head at FIFA, the continuing problems are both structural and cultural, part of a system that he said was still being run as a â€œpolitical cartel.â€ Infantino, for example, will stand unopposed for re-election later this year in an election that will mirror the one for the presidency of European soccer in February. In that race, the incumbent, Aleksander Ceferin, was re-elected by acclamation.Perhaps the biggest sign of FIFA's difficulties in changing the culture is its inability to wean the council members who will be in Miami off the kind of lifestyle even they have acknowledged to be excessive. At previous meetings, for example, members have described being met on the airport tarmac and whisked to luxury hotels without having to go through the usual arrival protocol. Even after FIFA's reforms, they receive annual salaries of $250,000, plus an additional per diem, to attend as few as three meetings a year.â€œThat's one of the reasons you maintain the cartel,â€ Maduro said. â€œYou have to satisfy the people that keep you in power.â€"
"It was meant to be a moment of triumph. Ada Hegerberg, a 23-year-old Norwegian soccer player, had just become the first woman to win the Ballon d'Or, one of soccer's most prestigious individual honors.But for some, the historic moment was quickly spoiled when, in an onstage exchange after her acceptance speech on Monday, the French D.J. Martin Solveig asked Ms. Hegerberg something that had nothing to do with her expertise: whether she knew how to twerk.â€œNo,â€ Ms. Hegerberg said, quickly dismissing the idea.The exchange took off on social media, where critics — including some high-profile athletes — accused Mr. Solveig of sexism and assailed him for undermining a moment of professional achievement with a reference to the provocative dance move. The controversy nearly overshadowed the news that Luka Modric beat Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the men's Ballon d'Or. The award for best player had been reserved for male players from its inception in 1956, until the women's Ballon d'Or was created this year.â€œThis is an absolute joke,â€ Lindsey Horan, a United States women's team midfielder who was one of the finalists for the women's Ballon d'Or, tweeted in response to Mr. Solveig's comment. She offered her support for Ms. Hegerberg: â€œCongrats and you do not deserve this.â€Andy Murray, the tennis star, also condemned the comment in a post on Instagram. â€œTo everyone who thinks people are overreacting and it was just a joke.. It wasn't,â€ he wrote. â€œI've been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.â€But even as others held up the moment as yet another example of sexism in sports, Ms. Hegerberg said she didn't view it that way. â€œI wasn't upset,â€ she told The Associated Press. â€œHe came to me after the situation and he apologized, but I didn't take it as that at all.â€She said her mind was on her achievement: â€œI got the Ballon d'Or.â€In a video posted on Twitter, Mr. Solveig said he was â€œamazedâ€ by the comments he had seen online. â€œI didn't mean to offend anyone and I didn't know that this could be seen as such an offense, especially if you consider the sequence in total,â€ he said.After Ms. Hegerber dismissed the twerking comment, Frank Sinatra's â€œFly Me to the Moonâ€ began to play, and she and Mr. Solveig slow-danced briefly.Mr. Solveig played music and danced throughout the ceremony. When Kylian MbappÃ©, who helped France's men's team win the World Cup this year, won the Kopa Trophy for the best men's player under 21, he and the D.J. danced (albeit without touching) to Drake's â€œGod's Plan.â€Still, in his Twitter post, Mr. Solveig acknowledged his comment to Ms. Hegerberg was a misstep: â€œThis was a joke — probably a bad one.â€The Ballon d'Or, awarded annually by the magazine France Football, was originally created to honor the European player of the year, and it has had a history of exclusion. The Brazilian soccer star PelÃ©, who never signed for a European club, never won the award, for example. It did not become a global prize until 2007.And while FIFA, world soccer's governing body, introduced a women's world player of the year award in 2001, the Ballon d'Or remained reserved for male players until September, when France Football's editor announced that the magazine would honor a woman for the first time this year.â€œWomen's soccer is a booming discipline that deserves the same respect as men's soccer,â€ the editor, Pascal Ferre, told The Associated Press.A list of 15 finalists was announced in October. The winner was chosen by a group of 40 voters — a different group from the judges for the men's award. Mr. Ferre said there were different voters because women's players deserved to be assessed by people who followed them regularly. â€œOnly experts can vote,â€ he said.Ms. Hegerberg, who plays for the perennial French champions Olympique Lyon, has spoken up about what she says is a lack of respect for women's soccer in Norway and has said she won't play for her home country in the next Women's World Cup.But in her acceptance speech on Monday, Ms. Hegerberg had a message for â€œyoung girls all over the world.â€â€œPlease,â€ she said, â€œbelieve in yourselves.â€"
"DORTMUND, Germany — At first glance, it is easy to pinpoint the start of the Bundesliga's love affair with young English players. The opening scene of a story that has swept a host of England's brightest prospects out of the Premier League's overstuffed academies and into top-flight German soccer is set at a specific time — the first few days of October 2016 — and in a specific place: Pula, Croatia.That week, England's under-17 team took part in the Croatian Cup, a youth invitational that also featured teams from Germany, Greece and the host nation. England won it, and in some style, rounding off the competition with an 8-1 rout of Germany.Even before that, though, the amount of talent on display had turned heads. Several scouts from Bundesliga clubs had been in attendance at Pula's Aldo Drosina Stadium for England's first game, a 5-0 win against Croatia.Though many of the English players involved would go on to win the under-17 World Cup a little more than a year later, one, in particular, stood out. A scout, present that day, remembers being taken aback by the player's appetite. Even with England comfortably ahead, he said, he kept running, kept trying to score goals.The scout flagged the player, Jadon Sancho, to his superiors, but to no avail. Less than a year later, Sancho was on his way to Germany, but to sign with Borussia Dortmund, another of the clubs that had watched him that day. Within a few months, he was a regular on Dortmund's first team, a senior England international and one of the most coveted players in Europe.He was also a trendsetter. After Sancho, a flood of young British players have landed in the Bundesliga: Arsenal's Emile Smith Rowe — another veteran of that Croatian trip — and Reiss Nelson, on loan at RB Leipzig and TSG Hoffenheim; representatives at Augsburg and Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach and Schalke.In January, Bayern Munich was so determined to sign Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi — another who featured in Croatia — that it offered 40 million euros (about $45 million) for a teenager who had made only a handful of senior appearances. Sancho's effect, the legacy of that day in Pula, has been powerful.It is a compelling story, but not necessarily an accurate one. Sancho has been presented as the trigger for German clubs' fascination with young English talent, but, in reality, he was the end result: a consequence, rather than a cause, of a trend that dates way beyond 2016, one that explains why, exactly, all of those Bundesliga scouts were watching that under-17 game in Pula.â€œAbout 10 years ago, we decided that young players had to be our focus as a club,â€ said Max Eberl, MÃ¶nchengladbach's sporting director. â€œWe had no financial potential to do anything else. We had to create money and value a different way.â€That meant keeping tabs on the best young talent not just in Germany, but across Europe. MÃ¶nchengladbach's scouts started watching national youth teams, a shortcut to establishing which players were regarded as the best in their homelands, and a chance to compare them directly with the talent on the rise in Germany.The initial emphasis, Eberl explained, was on France, Belgium and Holland — traditionally fertile breeding grounds — as well as markets like Denmark, where his club had strong links. England â€œwas not a market we had focused on,â€ he said, but it did not take long to realize that there were a â€œlot of top playersâ€ in England's age-group teams.Eberl dispatched scouts not to watch the Premier League, but to games between clubs' under-18 and under-23 teams. â€œAt the time, English clubs bought players but did not care about their academies,â€ he said. â€œThe players they were developing — 30 or 40 guys, really good, really well prepared — had no chance.â€Around the same time, Dortmund came to the same realization. â€œFive or 10 years ago, we had the feeling that the education and development of youth players in England is quite good,â€ Michael Zorc, the club's technical director, said. â€œThe teams don't only spend money on transfers and salaries, but on infrastructure. When you see these academies, you cannot compare the standard with Germany. It is much, much higher.â€Most important, these state-of-the-art facilities were churning out players with the skill sets Bundesliga clubs needed. â€œEngland had so many creative players,â€ Nils Schmadtke, formerly the head scout at Cologne, said. â€œKids like Sancho: good at penetrating the sidelines, not afraid in one against ones, good technique, fast.â€Just as significant as discovering this steady supply of talent in England, though, was the increasing demand in Germany.Youth is the Bundesliga's calling card. Germany's top division prides itself on its clubs' willingness to give players an opportunity — a report compiled in February found that it is the youngest of Europe's major leagues — regardless of age or experience. It sees and sells itself, according to one recent mailing, as a â€œtalent factory.â€Increasingly, though, there are concerns that less and less of that talent is emerging locally, at a time when German soccer — both at the international level and within the Bundesliga — is in need of renewal.The generation that won the 2014 World Cup failed miserably in Russia last summer, a disappointment compounded by relegation from its group in the inaugural Nations League last year. Joachim LÃ¶w, the national team coach, has vowed to transform the side, informing several stalwarts — Mats Hummels, Thomas MÃ¼ller and JÃ©rÃ´me Boateng — that they will no longer be considered for selection.For the first time in more than a decade, the Bundesliga will not be represented in the Champions League quarterfinals. Bayern Munich is already planning for a substantial overhaul of its squad at the end of the season.It is telling that Hudson-Odoi, a young English winger, is at the forefront of its thinking: Zorc admitted last month that at the under-17 and under-19 levels, England had â€œovertakenâ€ Germany. Schmadtke said that he believed the â€œindividual skillsâ€ he saw from young English players — as well as on scouting trips to France — stood out because they are now so rare in his homeland. For Bayern, as for the national team, the pipeline of German talent has dried up.Eberl, for one, believes that Germany has â€œmade mistakesâ€ in developing its young players. Clubs, he said, have fallen into the trap of trying to produce winning youth teams, rather than concentrating on individuals. Schmadtke feels German teenagers suffer because they are exposed too quickly to senior soccer, playing for so-called B teams in regional leagues, rather than in youth-specific competitions, as they do in England.Both are confident that it is a hiatus, rather than a full stop. â€œWe will have players in the future, but it will take time,â€ Eberl said. In the meantime, German clubs will continue to flock to England, hoping to find yet more players to follow the path Sancho has plotted. It is a result not of a love affair, but of the simple economics of supply and demand."
"LIVERPOOL, England — Friday morning, and Goodison Park is quiet. There are no fans milling around the streets outside, spilling out of the Winslow pub, eagerly rushing to their seats. There is no noise, no color, no riot of blue and white. There are only a handful of cars in the parking lot. It is spitting with rain.A stadium is a home, but that is, in truth, only an occasional role. These are places that blossom only every other weekend, as Goodison will on Sunday when Liverpool arrives for the latest Merseyside Derby. For much of the rest of the time, though, a stadium is dormant, quiet: an empty, expectant shell.The day-to-day life of a club — the parts of it that are dedicated to the business of soccer, and the parts of it dedicated to the soccer business — happens elsewhere. For Everton, the former is at Finch Farm, its training facility on the eastern fringes of Liverpool. The latter is in the Liver Buildings, on the city's sparkling waterfront, where Everton relocated its offices last year, a new home for all those departments whose job it is to sell shirts and tickets and sponsorship deals. To most fans, a club is a team, hopefully to win games. To all owners, a club is a business, hopefully to make money.A club is more than that, though; there is another side, one which does its work not on the field at Goodison Park or in the suite of offices in the city, but in the tight warren of terraced streets that surround the stadium, in schools across Liverpool, in some of the most underprivileged parts of Merseyside.Across the street from Goodison Park, a group of children are playing on the Cruyff Court — a small, artificial soccer field surrounded by a metal cage, built in conjunction with the Johan Cruyff Foundation — behind Everton's community hub. Inside, teenagers mill and mingle with teachers and coaches in Everton polo shirts.Around the corner, in what was once a run-down working men's club, a few dozen retirees are spending the morning cycling through their memories — of Everton, of the city — over tea and cake. Pat van den Hauwe, a tough-tackling defender who played for the team in the 1980s, is helping serve the coffee.On Goodison Road, the club has bought three houses and converted them into drop-in centers, safe spaces for anyone who feels they need a place to go. Their doors are always open. There is always someone to talk to. There is always food in the fridge.All clubs run outreach programs, of course, and employ staff members to work in the communities they call home. But few, if any, can match Everton's for size and scope. The buildings that house Everton in the Community cost more than $10 million to develop; the program's annual budget is around $4 million. It has 125 staff members and 145 volunteers. It works in more than 200 locations: schools, youth clubs, community centers.There is barely a part of life in Liverpool — and particularly in the L4 postal code that is home to both Goodison Park and Anfield, Liverpool's stadium, and among the most deprived areas in Britain — that the club does not touch.It oversees more than 40 social programs, focused on issues as diffuse as mental health and serious organized crime; it reaches more than 20,000 people a year. Last year, Everton won a grant of 700,000 pounds, or about $925,000, to lead a government scheme on Merseyside to tackle gang culture. It has a presence in 150 schools. In September 2015, it became the first club to launch its own school.Everton has, for more than a decade, styled itself as Liverpool's People's Club, a term popularized by David Moyes, its former manager, to distinguish it from its near neighbor. Banners bearing the phrase flutter from Goodison Park; scarves embossed with the slogan can be bought from stands around the stadium on match day.â€œOur fans hold us up against that image,â€ Everton's chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said. â€œThey expect us to live up to it. It is not a corporate social responsibility program. It is long-term, strategic work. It is a huge component of what Everton is.â€ So substantial, in fact, that before she was promoted to running Everton last year, Barrett-Baxendale ran not the commercial section of the club, or its merchandising arm, but its community department.It is not just the scale of Everton's work that marks it as different, though; it is the scope of it, too. Everton goes into areas other clubs — and other charities, even — might find â€œintimidating,â€ as Barrett-Baxendale put it. Sue Gregory, Everton in the Community's director of youth engagement, recalls representatives of other teams marveling at the fact that Everton — in theory, just a soccer club — was prepared to work with convicted criminals, drug dealers, members of gangs. â€œYou could see it as the club risking its brand,â€ she said.Barrett-Baxendale does not. â€œWe work on these issues because these issues exist on the streets of Merseyside,â€ she said. It is a view supported throughout the club. At the start of the season, Everton's players signed a pledge that they would do their part to help with community work. A copy of it hangs on a wall in the Community's hub. There have been times that players have had to be reminded to leave after sessions there: Tom Davies, the midfielder, once insisted he was happy to stay for as long as possible at one session because he was busy â€œcoloring in unicorns.â€Gregory, her staff and her volunteers know how much all of that matters. They hear all of the stories: the teenagers forced to work selling drugs for gangs to settle their parents' debts, or chased through the streets for punishment beatings; the boys sent hundreds of miles from home as part of the â€œcounty linesâ€ phenomenon, in which city gangs seek to control the drug market in smaller towns; the children who stock up on food at the sessions because there is not enough to eat at home.Everton does not have a choice, in other words, but to confront those problems. Shying away from them would make all the work it does nothing but tokenism. â€œThis is our community,â€ Gregory said, adding: â€œThese are the issues our community faces. There is a culture of â€˜let's try.'â€Wherever it can, it makes the most of the power of its crest: The white-on-blue depiction of Prince Rupert's Tower, instantly recognizable, is part of the city's civic scenery. It transcends tribal loyalty — many Liverpool fans are part of the Everton programs — and represents, instead, permanence.â€œPeople trust the badge,â€ said Richard Kenyon, Everton in the Community's chief executive. â€œThey respond to it in a really powerful way. They're drawn to it.â€Those who would normally eschew authority figures, those who would not respond to local government or a school principal, respond to that crest. Everton, they know, is not going anywhere.â€œWe are a consistent presence,â€ Gregory said. â€œKids might have a really good connection with a teacher in one year, but then they move on, and the kids lose that. We are always there, so that bond is not lost.â€This, more than the team or the business, is what a club is, what a club can do. Not far from Goodison Park is one of Everton in the Community's smallest projects: a little corner of scrap land that has been converted into an herb garden. The plot is little more than a postage stamp. When Everton started it, encouraging children from these streets to tend to it, some worried that it would be ruined, vandalized, maybe even in its first few days. That was months ago. It is still pristine."
"ATLANTA — Most teams that win championships enjoy a honeymoon. There are parades and victory laps and time to prepare for a title defense.Not so with Atlanta United, which won its first M.L.S. Cup on Dec. 8 and, because of Major League Soccer roster rules, had to spend the next day releasing some of the players who led it to the title. In fact, from almost the moment the final whistle blew in Atlanta United's 2-0 victory over the Portland Timbers, the club president, Darren Eales, has had to grapple with a host of changes, including finding a new coach, selling one of his team's best players and juggling the remaking of a star-studded roster.At times, the off-season has seemed comically short. Atlanta United reconvened as a team and opened its preseason training camp in mid-January, then flew to California before the Super Bowl to prepare for a preseason friendly against Club Tijuana. Last week, Atlanta United lost to Costa Rica's Herediano, 3-1, in the first stage of the Concacaf Champions League (the teams meet again in Atlanta on Thursday night), and on Sunday it opens its M.L.S. season against D.C. United in Washington.All of this meant Eales had to get his off-season work done quickly, and he has not wasted any time. On Jan. 14, Atlanta United introduced Frank de Boer, the former manager of Ajax, Inter Milan and Crystal Palace, as the replacement for Atlanta's former coach, Tata Martino, who took over Mexico's national team. Then Eales signed Josef MartÃ­nez, the league's most valuable player last season, to a five-year contract extension. Soon after, Pity MartÃ­nez, a 25-year-old Argentine midfielder, was signed; that move allowed Eales to sell Atlanta's playmaker, Miguel AlmirÃ³n, to England's Newcastle United for a reported $23 million, smashing the M.L.S. transfer record.Two days before the Super Bowl, the hyperkinetic Eales sat down at his favorite Atlanta coffee shop — appropriately named Octane — to discuss the team's dizzying off-season, its sale of AlmirÃ³n and whether, in fact, other teams in M.L.S. can copy the Atlanta model.You knew you were going to have a lot of holes to fill in the off-season. What was the process?When we went out and built the club, our intention was to be clear with the fans from the very start. We were going to attract players who were young, or going toward the prime of their career, rather than a last contract or a last hurrah for a player from Europe. The idea here is, we're part of this global network of soccer clubs. Miggy came to us, he had two fantastic years, won the M.L.S. Cup in the second season, had tremendous success on the pitch, and then he got a chance to fulfill his dream to go to the Premier League and play for a club there. So obviously, it was good for him, good for the league, because now the league can say, â€˜We have a mechanism for you to showcase yourself, so come to M.L.S., play in a short window, and when the right moment comes, you can move to a top league in Europe.' That was the dream we sold, and we had to at least prove the concept because otherwise it was going to be difficult for us to recruit other players if we didn't do that.This business model is routine elsewhere, but it's still new to M.L.S. Wasn't it hard to see AlmirÃ³n go?Miggy delivered everything we could have expected, and we won an M.L.S. Cup. On top of that, we didn't spend dead money on a player at the end of his contract and get nothing in return. We actually got well in excess of what we had spent on the player in the first place. So it makes good business sense, good sporting sense, and that was always the vision.You signed Josef MartÃ­nez to a contract extension, then acquired Pity MartÃ­nez, before you sold AlmirÃ³n. Was that sequencing deliberate?We're really pleased that we did the whole succession plan in reverse. We got our player in [MartÃ­nez] before we moved the player on to Europe [AlmirÃ³n]. Hypothetically, if we first sold a player for $30 million and went out to buy a player, everyone's going to quote us $30 million. It's the nature of the beast. So to secure our replacement in advance with a number we were comfortable with, it gave us a little more carte blanche.You also had to replace Tata Martino, whose reputation was instrumental in attracting young players to Atlanta for the first year.When we sat there after winning the Cup, we knew the coach was going. The reality is, it's no different than Nick Saban, who has said how he loses his coordinators every year but he doesn't mind because he knows the replacements come in and work hard because they have a chance to move on. We can embrace that as a club. When coaches want to come to Atlanta, they can see that as well. Frank de Boer coached at Ajax, at Inter and Crystal Palace. For me, I'm really excited because certain coaches fit players. With Ajax, he had great success. He went into situations [at Inter and Crystal Palace] that weren't good fits. But he was the right fit for us.A lot has had to go right: Not just the success on the field, but an owner with deep pockets, a new stadium, enthusiastic fans. You have all of that.Everyone's been asking when soccer is going to succeed in America, but if you watched the Cup final, with 73,000 passionate fans who were tailgating all afternoon, with an exciting style of play, it really has happened in America already. It's great for me because yes, I wanted to make Atlanta United a real success story. But we're also part of the bigger story, which is growing the game of soccer in America, being the pioneers to hopefully one day make it one of the top leagues in the world.Can other M.L.S. teams replicate what you've done?I'm not sure about replicating, but like every other business, you look at what other businesses are doing successfully and try to take those things that might work. I'm a fan of how L.A.F.C. came into the league. You saw the way they filled out their roster; there were similarities. I wouldn't say they were copying us, but there were similarities. That's a good thing. We were in a strange situation as pioneers trying to grow the league. There will be more teams looking, when they think of their out-of-pocket expenditures, money above the cap, not just the salaries — there's much more awareness around investing more than we would have in a transfer fee for a younger player because we might have a chance to make a profit, or make our investment back. That's going to open up an avenue for a few more clubs.With all this activity, did you get a chance to take any time off this winter?My aim is to get to March, the international break. I promised the wife and family I'll take a week off, and football won't be mentioned. I'm hoping to get to the end of March and then I'll crash."
"(Reuters) - Ravichandran Ashwin's recent 'Mankad' dismissal of Jos Buttler in the Indian Premier League was not ""within the spirit of the game"", the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has said after reviewing footage of the incident.The MCC, custodian of cricket's laws, had earlier said the decision could have gone either way depending on how 'the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball' is interpreted.""Having extensively reviewed the incident again and after further reflection we don't think it was within the spirit of the game,"" Fraser Stewart, the MCC's manager of the laws of cricket, told the Daily Telegraph.Kings XI Punjab captain Ashwin sparked a chorus of disapproval from fellow players and pundits after running out Buttler when the Rajasthan Royals batsman was backing up at the non-striker's end instead of completing his delivery.The dismissal, named after India bowler Vinoo Mankad who ran out Australia's Bill Brown in similar fashion in 1947, is permitted under cricket's laws but viewed by some as going against the spirit of the game.The MCC changed its stance because Ashwin paused after his delivery stride and waited for Buttler to leave the crease before whipping the bails off.""We believe the pause was too long between the time Ashwin reached the crease and the moment it was reasonable to expect the ball would be delivered,"" Stewart added.""When Buttler could have reasonably expected the ball to be delivered, he was in his ground. We now think at the key moment Buttler was in his ground.""Buttler, it's fair to say, did not make a concerted effort to get back into his crease after Ashwin had delayed his delivery, and didn't help himself in that respect.""Stewart said non-strikers should stop trying to gain an advantage by backing up before the ball was bowled.""It's also unfair and against the spirit of cricket for non-strikers to leave their ground too early,"" he added. ""All these debates wouldn't be necessary if non-strikers remained in their ground until the ball is on its way down the pitch."" (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru, Editing by Simon Jennings)"

"MELBOURNE — Six months after being slammed by critics, Australia's one-day team is building nicely in the lead up to the Cricket World Cup with all the players singing from the same song sheet, captain Aaron Finch has said.Resurgent Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash of Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday, with all top four batsmen posting half-centuries in a commanding 20-run win, the team's eighth in succession.The turnaround, which included a 3-2 series win in India prior to the United Arab Emirates tour, is all the more remarkable given that it comes in the wake of a six-series losing streak dating back to January 2016.""If you think back to six months ago, a lot of people were slamming us, a lot of people were writing us off for not just one-day cricket but all forms of cricket,"" Finch told reporters.""When you're building towards something and you've changed a bit of your strategy and game plan, I think it can take a little bit of time to develop.""It took a bit of time for guys maybe to fully buy into it and believe that it was the right way to play one-day cricket and the right strategy to go with.""As Australia stumbled through a dreadful 2018 in the wake of the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal, Finch's poor form with the bat was emblematic of the team's struggles.The stocky opening batsman has played a huge part in the team's revival, however, smashing 451 runs at an average of 112.75 against Pakistan to top the runs list and be named player of the series.Finch was dismissed for under 50 just once against Pakistan and fell only 27 runs short of George Bailey's Australian record of 478 for the most runs scored in a bilateral series.""It was probably my most consistent (series) as a batter,"" said Finch.""I think if you look back through my career, there's been times when I've got a couple of hundreds an there will be some really low scores in there as well.""It was nice to get a good start each game and still kicking myself at a couple of chances, (and innings) where I could have gone on and got some really big match-winning scores.""BRUTALLY UNLUCKYFinch's opening partnership with Usman Khawaja has been a huge success, with the latter third on the runs list with 272 at an average of 54.40 against Pakistan after also dominating with the bat against Virat Kohli's India.Australia's rejuvenation has come without opener David Warner and former captain Steve Smith, who were suspended for ball-tampering until March 29, and minus injured first-choice fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.Warner, meanwhile, has given selectors a headache by hammering a 55-ball century in the Indian Premier League on Sunday, continuing his brilliant start in the Twenty20 tournament with Sunrisers Hyderabad.""We know categorically there are going to be one or two guys brutally unlucky not to get selected because they're all going so well,"" Australia coach Justin Langer said of the World Cup squad, slated to be named next week.""The blokes in the squad at the moment will be praying it's not them.""

"KABUL, Afghanistan — If ever a team needed to win big for its fans' sake, it was this one — at this moment.On Monday, Afghanistan's beloved national cricket squad prompted cheers back home by winning its first-ever match in the Test format, the sport's highest level of competition.The win, against Ireland at a Test match in northern India, is an increasingly rare commodity: a good news story in Afghanistan. Security forces there are fighting a desperate, bloody campaign against the Taliban, and many fear that if the United States reaches a deal with the insurgents, it could jeopardize human rights and the safety of ethnic minority groups.â€œPeople are in love with cricket, and amid the news of suicide attacks, bombing of civilians and losses of security forces, it is the only thing that brings happiness,â€ said Nazim Jar Abdurrahimzai, the game development manager at the Afghanistan Cricket Board.Afghan fans have been jubilant on social media since the victory. The cricket board has said that celebrations are planned, and that some fans plan to greet the members of the team when they arrive at the Kabul airport on Wednesday.Praise for the team has also poured in from cricket fans, players and organizations around the world.Even the former cricket star Imran Khan, now the prime minister of neighboring Pakistan, which has tense relations with Afghanistan, congratulated the country on its â€œamazing successes in such a short period of their exposure to international cricket.â€Afghanistan's first cricket team was founded more than a decade ago by players returning home from a refugee camp in Pakistan. The sport later grew into a national obsession, a status it already enjoyed across much of South Asia.Afghan cricket stars like Rashid Khan are now mega-celebrities whose faces are plastered across billboards. Television channels and radio stations avidly follow their matches, and the local fan base has rapidly grown.â€œAfghanistan's cricket team has surmounted obstacles unknown to most athletes — terrorism, displacement, war — and with flair and panache that have won admirers the world over,â€ the cricket journalist Sidharth Monga wrote last year in the Opinion section of The New York Times.Cricket's Test format, in which matches last up to five days, is the sport's most exclusive club. In 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the first new Test countries since Bangladesh was promoted to Test status in 2000.In Afghanistan's inaugural Test match last year, the national team was routed by India in just two days. The team's coach, Phil Simmons, said at the time that while his players had a â€œhugeâ€ learning curve to overcome, they also had an admirable work ethic.â€œNow we know that we have to work five times as hard,â€ Mr. Simmons said.The team's Test victory on Monday came on the fourth day of a match at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, in the northern Indian city of Dehradun. Afghanistan is now only the third country — along with England and Pakistan — to win after just two appearances at the Test level. (Only Australia won faster, on its first try.)President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan called the victory â€œa proud moment for the whole nation.â€Mohammad Nabi, one of the team's stars, vowed that it would not be Afghanistan's last. â€œIf we can put up a good score on the board, then we are confident of beating any team in the world,â€ he said.A major challenge will come this spring, when the team makes its second appearance at the ICC Cricket World Cup in England and Wales. Although Afghanistan is ranked 10th out of 10 teams at the tournament, its captain, Asghar Afghan, said recently that the goal was not merely to show up but to win. Sharaf Naib, 23, a construction worker in Kabul, said by telephone on Tuesday that he had already built a Cricket World Cup trophy — out of snow — in anticipation.â€œThis is the only thing that gives us a break from the ongoing violence and sad incidents happening in the country,â€ he said of the cricket team's success. â€œIt's our only social life.â€"
"MUMBAI — Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal has courted controversy again, despite only recently being brought back to the international fold following a two-year absence, after breaching a team curfew ahead of the fifth one-dayer against Australia.Akmal was sent home from Pakistan's 2017 Champions Trophy squad in England for failing fitness tests and followed that up with a public outburst against head coach Mickey Arthur.He was recalled for the first time since that spat for Pakistan's five-match series against Australia in the United Arab Emirates.The Pakistan Cricket Board said the 28-year-old had been fined 20 percent of his match fee and received an official reprimand for a late night-out ahead of Sunday's fifth ODI against Australia in Dubai.The cricketer pleaded guilty to the charge, apologised and accepted the sanction, the PCB added.""I am glad that Umar has realised his mistake, and has accepted and apologised for his actions, which were clearly unprofessional and in no way can be ignored or overlooked,"" PCB managing director Wasim Khan said in a statement.""The PCB expects a high level of professionalism and commitment from its players, and this action is a reiteration and timely reminder that any indiscipline shall not be tolerated or accepted.""Akmal made his debut as a 19-year-old in 2009 in a test against New Zealand. Once considered the future of Pakistan's batting, he played the last of his 16 matches in the longest format in 2011.He was part of the playing side in all five matches in the UAE and totalled 150 runs during the series, which Australia won 5-0.

"SYDNEY — Jhye Richardson's hopes of playing at the Cricket World Cup have received a boost after scans on his injured shoulder ruled out any bone damageÂ or fracture for the young Australia fast bowler.The 22-year-old completed only half his quota of overs in Sunday's second one-day international against Pakistan in Sharjah before he was forced off the field having dislocated his bowling shoulder when trying to save a boundary.Richardson, who had been considered a certainty for Australia's World Cup squad, sat out the rest of the match with his arm in a sling and was sent home immediately for scans.""The scans demonstrated the usual soft tissue damage we expect following a dislocation but fortunatelyÂ has excluded any bone damageÂ or fracture,"" Richard Saw, Australian men's team doctor, said in a statement on Thursday.""We are hopeful that Jhye will not require surgery but he will see a shoulder specialist early next week for a further opinion.

""I'm not ruling out the World Cup at this stage, that's definitely not an option.""It's all about getting the shoulder right at this stage.""JL (Coach Justin Langer) said he's pleased with how I've been going about my business, I was really satisfied with how I played in India and going into the Pakistan series as well I was happy with the way I was playing.""The shoulder injury is unfortunate, but these things do happen and I'm eager to bounce back quickly.""Australia will defend their 50-over World Cup title in England and Wales from May 30.

"JALALABAD, Afghanistan — During a lull in Afghanistan's never-ending war, before the fighting season resumes once again in the spring, Taliban fighters recall laying down their Kalashnikovs and, for a brief moment, enjoying a game of cricket.The sport is the only one most of the fighters enjoy, commanders say, with matches attracting hundreds of spectators from Taliban-controlled villages when there is no fighting. They are also fans of the increasingly successful national team.""I love cricket,"" said Mullah Badruddin, a Taliban commander in Khogyani district of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, where a tournament organized by the militants at the start of last winter drew large crowds.""When Afghanistan play against another team, we listen to the radio with great interest and we also check for scores in social media and follow those in Facebook who give live updates,"" he told Reuters by telephone.First played in Afghanistan by British troops in the 19th Century, the game was adopted by Afghans in the refugee camps of cricket-loving Pakistan, where more than 3 million fled a Soviet invasion and civil war in the 1980s and 1990s, and has since made huge strides in the country, particularly among ethnic Pashtuns in the eastern border provinces. Taj Malook Khan, who helped set up the Afghan Cricket Club in Kacha Gari refugee camp outside the Pakistani city of Peshawar in the 1980s, and a small group of players used to cross into Afghanistan during the 1990s Taliban era to play and promote cricket.The Taliban had banned games such as cricket and football in the early years of their austere rule because they believed they kept men away from prayers, according to former national cricketer Hasti Gul, but later became more tolerant of cricket.From there, despite at least two attacks in the past couple of years on cricket matches claimed by the ultra radical Islamic State group, the game now rivals football for popularity in a country that has long been cut off from international sport.STAR NAMESAdmitted as a full member of the International Cricket Council in 2017, Afghanistan won its first five-day Test match against Ireland last month after making steady progress in the lower levels of the international game.However it is in the dynamic, shorter form of the sport that Afghans have had most impact.Players such as spin bowler Rashid Khan or big hitting batsman Mohammad Nabi Esakhil have become undisputed stars of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the razzle-dazzle showcase of so-called T20 cricket, the 12th season of which has just got under way.Despite the Taliban's former suspicion of organized sports and their opposition to much of the transformation in Afghanistan since their hardline Islamic regime was toppled in 2001, many of the mainly Pashtun movement's fighters are fans.Unlike football, which offends the sensibilities of some very conservative Muslims because it is normally played in shorts, cricket is played in long sleeves and trousers, in line with traditional dress codes. It also bears some resemblance to traditional Afghan children's games involving throwing and using sticks to hit smaller sticks or balls.Karim Sadiq, a former batsman in the national team and an early pioneer of the sport who visited some Taliban-controlled areas in eastern Afghanistan this year, said he was mobbed by fighters asking about the game and their favorite players.A video clip he shot on his mobile phone shows dozens of Taliban, many with Kalashnikov automatic rifles slung across their shoulders, dissecting the quality of the team.""I like all the players but my favorite is Rashid Khan Arman,"" says one fighter, referring to the young spin bowler who stars for the Afghan national side and IPL's Sunrisers Hyderabad. ""His bowling is amazing.""WORLD CUP DREAMWith the approach of the cricket World Cup in England and Wales from May to July, Afghanistan's hopes of making a dent in the tournament are higher than they have ever been, even if few give them a chance against giants of the game such as India, Australia or England.""We have a very strong team and my dream is Afghanistan bring the World Cup home,"" said Hazrat Gul, a young cricketer in the eastern city of Jalalabad, as he prepared to play a friendly match against a team from neighboring Kunar province.As peace talks between the U.S. government and Taliban officials continue and Afghanistan looks for a way out of 40 years of conflict, excitement is building and officials and government ministers lavish praise on the players, whom President Ashraf Ghani has called national heroes.From the other side of the war, the feeling is similar. Sadiq who has just returned to practice after a long injury, aiming to take part in the upcoming World Cup, said the Taliban usually send them congratulatory messages through social media and on his cellphone when Afghanistan win.Such broad appeal has seen the sport widely hailed as a unifying force in Afghanistan, a patchwork of different languages and cultures, sometimes at peace with each other but increasingly in recent years in conflict.ETHNIC DIVIDESNot everyone is on board the cricket bandwagon, however.Look deeper, and the state of the game has much to say about a country where sport has repeatedly attracted violence, including suicide attacks on cricket and wrestling matches, and where politics is increasingly divided along ethnic lines that shade into all aspects of life.For many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras, cricket is a sport for Pashtuns, the dominant ethnic group from the south and east of the country that has provided almost all kings and presidents throughout Afghan history.""I have no interest and don't know anything about cricket,"" said Ahmad Jawad, a shopkeeper in Parwan, a mainly Tajik province north of Kabul. ""It's a Pashtun game with Pashtun players, so let them enjoy their game.""After the Taliban fell following the U.S.-led campaign of 2001, Sadiq and Gul - brothers who, like many teammates, learned their cricket in Pakistan - and other players struggled to convince Tajik commanders from the victorious Northern Alliance that swept into Kabul to allow them to continue playing the game.""Palace officials told us to join Afghan guard units and forget about cricket,"" said Gul, who recalled having to cancel a provincial tournament in Kabul in 2005 after losing a fistfight with soccer players who wanted to use the pitch.Now, with the IPL beamed into homes all over the country and the looming World Cup, he feels change is coming and the sport can give Afghanistan a platform no other can equal, one that offers hope for a more normal future after so many years of war.""We literally had no support from the government for so many years before they have realized we could bring glory to our country,"" he said. ""Now everyone loves cricket and we are so proud to raise our national flag on the world stage.""

"The Swiss watch brand Hublot, which has partnered with the likes of the FIFA World Cup and the Ferrari Formula One team, has announced that it will continue its role as official timekeeper of the Cricket World Cup, with the 2019 competition scheduled to start May 30.The event is sponsored by the International Cricket Council and held every four years — this year in England and Wales.Hublot's previous high-profile sporting affiliations have put it in competition with more established watch brands, such as Rolex, Omega and Audemars Piguet, each of which has successfully used sports to raise brand awareness. Hublot was founded in 1980 and has been owned by LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton since 2008.Ricardo Guadalupe, Hublot's chief executive, said that Hublot's strategy was to invest in sports that have a global footprint and little, if any, association with other Swiss watch brands. In the past, Audemars Piguet had worked with Sachin Tendulkar and Ulysse Nardin with Yuvraj Singh, both Indian cricketers, but Hublot is the first to partner with the organizing council.â€œCricket is virgin territory,â€ Mr. Guadalupe said in an interview during the announcement of the partnership at the brand's Bond Street boutique in London.Mr. Guadalupe said cricket also would give Hublot a route to market in targeted regions. â€œCricket is huge in India,â€ he said. â€œThere is potential to grow heavily in India and with Indians, who buy all over the world.â€Cricket is India's most popular sport. The national broadcaster Star India reported that its television coverage of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, also sponsored by Hublot, was watched by more than 600 million people in the country. (The 2019 Super Bowl had a domestic audience of 98.2 million, according to the research firm Nielsen.)â€œWe've had double-digit growth in India since we got involved in cricket,â€ Mr. Guadalupe said, adding that this summer Hublot plans to open its first stand-alone boutique in Mumbai, India's financial center and largest city, and is working on one in New Delhi.Mr. Guadalupe declined to disclose the cost of the I.C.C. partnership, but said that it was in the â€œsingle millionsâ€ of dollars and much less costly than Hublot's soccer affiliations.As part of the cricket deal, Hublot had announced a 100-piece limited-edition watch, a version of its 45-millimeter Classic Fusion Chronograph that is scheduled for release on March 23. (Mr. Guadalupe said the 2,018-piece limited-edition connected watch that Hublot made for the 2018 World Cup sold out in four weeks.)Mr. Guadalupe also said that some top Hublot customers would be given a special experience at the Cricket World Cup, but that the reason for the partnership was to â€œbuild and shape the consumer of tomorrow.â€"
"In November 2016, American diplomats in Cuba complained of persistent, high-pitched sounds followed by a range of symptoms, including headaches, nausea and hearing loss. Exams of nearly two dozen of them eventually revealed signs of concussions or other brain injuries, and speculation about the cause turned to weapons that blast sound or microwaves. Amid an international uproar, a recording of the sinister droning was widely circulated in the news media. On Friday, two scientists presented evidence that those sounds were not so mysterious after all. They were made by crickets, the researchers concluded.That's not to say that the diplomats weren't attacked, the scientists added — only that the recording is not of a sonic weapon, as had been suggested.Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley, and Fernando Montealegre-Z of the University of Lincoln in England studied a recording of the sounds made by diplomats and published by The Associated Press.â€œThere's plenty of debate in the medical community over what, if any, physical damage there is to these individuals,â€ said Mr. Stubbs in a phone interview. â€œAll I can say fairly definitively is that the A.P.-released recording is of a cricket, and we think we know what species it is.â€Mr. Stubbs presented the results of the analysis at the annual meeting of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology. He and Dr. Montealegre-Z also posted an early version of their study online. They plan to submit the paper to a scientific journal in the next few days.When Mr. Stubbs first heard the recording, he was reminded of insects he came across while doing field work in the Caribbean. When he and Dr. Montealegre-Z downloaded the sound file, they found that its acoustic patterns — such as the rate of pulses and the strongest frequencies — were very similar to the songs of certain kinds of insects.Male singing insects produce regular patterns during courtship. Females are attracted to certain males based on their songs, which has led to the evolution of different songs in different species.If the sounds heard by the diplomats were made by insects, Mr. Stubbs and Dr. Montealegre-Z reasoned, it might be possible to pinpoint the particular species. To search for a match, the researchers analyzed field recordings of North American insects stored in an online database at the University of Florida. They found a striking resemblance to one species in particular: the Indies short-tailed cricket.Yet the cricket's song differs from the Cuban recording in one important respect. The noises heard by the diplomats were erratic, while the insects make high-pitched, rapid-fire pulses.Mr. Stubbs suspected that this mismatch might be an artifact of the recording itself. Diplomats made their recordings inside houses, while biologists have recorded the crickets in the wild.So Mr. Stubbs played the cricket recording in a house. As the calls bounced off the walls, they echoed in a pattern similar to the irregular pulses heard on the Cuban recording.The song of the Indies short-tailed cricket â€œmatches, in nuanced detail, the A.P. recording in duration, pulse repetition rate, power spectrum, pulse rate stability, and oscillations per pulse,â€ the scientists wrote in their analysis.Experts on cricket songs said the analysis was well done. â€œIt all seems to make sense,â€ said Gerald Pollack of McGill University, who studies acoustic communication among insects. â€œIt's a pretty well supported hypothesis.â€When the American diplomats first complained of the strange noises in Cuba, they dismissed the possibility that insects were responsible. But short-tailed crickets are exceptional: They have long been known to make a tremendous racket.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]â€œThe song of the males of this cricket, here, is a continuous ringing z-z-z-z-z-z- of tremendous volume and penetration which practically fills a room with veritable din,â€ an entomologist in the Dominican Republic reported in 1957. Mr. Stubbs recorded short-tailed crickets while in Costa Rica, and he found their songs overpowering. â€œThey're incredibly loud,â€ he said. â€œYou can hear them from inside a diesel truck going forty miles an hour on the highway.â€The Indies short-tailed cricket is known to live in the Florida Keys, Jamaica and Grand Cayman. A closely related cricket is known to live in Cuba, and Mr. Stubbs suspects that its Indies cousin lives there, too.Mr. Stubbs said that his conclusion does not rule out an attack on American diplomats. But the sounds linked to the initial complaints may have been a red herring.â€œIt's entirely possible that they got sick with some other completely unrelated thing that was not a sonic attack, or that they were targeted in some other way,â€ he said. Dr. Douglas Smith, who led the medical examination of the American diplomats, questioned how much a single recording could reveal about the experience. Some patients didn't report hearing anything unusual, he noted, while others heard a range of sounds.â€œIt could be like a low-tone motor, or metal scraping, or like driving in a car with the back window open,â€ said Dr. Smith, director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania.Dr. Smith wouldn't rule out the possibility that some diplomats might have heard crickets, but said that had no bearing on the real damage they've suffered. â€œThese patients have gone through a lot,â€ he added. â€œI would like to know what the sounds are, but for us the more important thing is really what's going on in the patients' brains and what we can do about it.â€"
"ST.-OMER, France — The players erupted in joy, dancing and shouting in Pashto, celebrating their second victory in a regional cricket tournament. It might have been a familiar scene in parts of Afghanistan or Pakistan, but it was far less so here in northern France.The St.-Omer Cricket Club Stars, known as Soccs, had just won a tournament on their home turf, a new cricket field next to a cow pasture. For their captain, Javed Ahmadzai, however, the sweetest triumph lay elsewhere.â€œThe best victory is off the pitch,â€ said Mr. Ahmadzai, 32, a stonemason who arrived in France from Afghanistan in 2005. â€œWhen we teach cricket to children in local schools and they won't let us go, or tell their parents: â€˜You see, Mom, migrants aren't all mean.' â€Bringing cricket to life in St.-Omer is about far more than sports for Mr. Ahmadzai and his teammates. It is an opportunity to be part of the community, to be thought of as local champions rather than just as foreigners.That hasn't always been easy.During the European migration crisis of 2015, refugees hoping to reach Britain gathered in squalid camps in northern France, living in treacherous conditions in places like the â€œJungleâ€ in Calais, less than 30 miles north of St.-Omer.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant party in France and presidential candidate, argued that the country had been hurt by â€œmassive immigration,â€ and often cited the camps in her attacks.Her message was well received in the region, and in the first round of the presidential election last year, more residents of St.-Omer voted for Ms. Le Pen than for any other candidate. (She won 39 percent of the town's vote in the second round compared with 33.9 percent nationally.)Yet two years after the government cleared the â€œJungle,â€ in October 2016, there are still frequent police raids on migrant camps, and the lives of many seem stuck in limbo. The number of migrants in the Calais area has since dropped to 400 from 8,000. Many, including some who once lived in the Jungle and hoped to cross the English Channel, have decided to stay in St.-Omer.They study, work or seek jobs and, in the case of some Soccs players, hope that their sport will help them establish themselves in the town of 16,000 people. St.-Omer has sheltered more than 5,600 since 2015, most of them in a center for underage refugees.â€œWhenever young Afghans arrive in St.-Omer, one of the first things they ask is where they can play cricket,â€ said Jean-FranÃ§ois Roger, the regional director of France Terre d'Asile, a state-funded organization that helps refugees. â€œSoccs gives them a framework. It helps them move forward and build something here.â€France is not exactly known for cricket, a sport played primarily in the former British Empire. It hardly figures in the national sports pantheon, with 1,800 cricket players in some 50 French clubs, compared with 2.2 million registered soccer players. Yet with the influx of migrants from Afghanistan, the number of cricket teams in northern France has grown to nine from two.The Soccs are among them. In summer 2016, Mr. Ahmadzai and other Afghans were playing cricket with a homemade ball in a public park in St.-Omer when a local businessman who was out running, Christophe Silvie, stopped to ask them about the game. A few months later, Mr. Silvie and Mr. Ahmadzai founded the club with another volunteer living nearby, Nicolas Rochas.The team practiced in a local gymnasium and won a first tournament. Then another.Today, some 30 players from St.-Omer and surrounding areas, ages 15 to 33, have helped turn the town into a center of cricket excellence. (In reality, there was little suspense in the recent final: The club has two teams, and both beat their rivals in the regular league and the playoffs. So the club's first team played the second in that final match.)â€œCricket has helped the players gain priceless self-confidence and fight loneliness and isolation,â€ said Mr. Rochas, the vice president of Soccs, who watched the final in September with his two young children. â€œIt's more than a club — we are now like a family.â€For years, St.-Omer was the only town in the region with a France Terre d'Asile center for underage refugees, most of whom came from Eritrea and Afghanistan. In 2017, Afghanistan was the second country of origin for asylum seekers in France, with 6,000 of a total 100,000 requests. The organization accommodated 2,230 migrants in the town in 2017, up from 300 in 2013. Many of the young Soccs players went through the center.â€œI feel like I've grown up so much here, and I know the people, so I want those titles to be like a gift for St.-Omer,â€ Abdulwali Akulkhil, a 17-year-old Soccs player from Afghanistan who once lived in the center, said of the team's victories.William Gasparini, a professor of sociology at the University of Strasbourg who specializes in sports, said that team activities could indeed be a springboard for integration, providing connections far beyond the field.â€œManagers of amateur clubs are often local businessmen or people who are well connected in the area, so it gives the migrants some useful social capital,â€ he said.Mr. Rochas, the team vice president who is known among the players as Big Brother, has helped several get into training programs in farm trucking and mechanics. He also helped another player, who speaks five languages and wants to become a diplomat, get an internship in the French Parliament.Yet, for all the progress on and off the field, Soccs players have faced resistance. Xenophobic messages popped up on social media when the town's mayor, FranÃ§ois Decoster, said the club could build a cricket ground on an unused plot of land on the edge of the town. Some posts threatened to damage the site and others spread a rumor that a mosque would be built there.â€œI had to explain again and again who these young men were and where they came from,â€ said Mr. Decoster, a member of a centrist party. â€œIntegration can be a long, rocky process.â€The mayor says that efforts to help refugees settle â€œat a local level and at the appropriate scaleâ€ through initiatives like sports could help fight many preconceptions. If more cities and countries favored such activities, â€œwe wouldn't have the Salvinis, the Orbans and the Le Pens,â€ he said, referring to the interior minister of Italy, the prime minister of Hungary, and the French far-right leader.Complaints about Soccs seem to have tapered, but Mr. Decoster's optimism has yet to be followed by a strong showing of local support for the team. Only a few dozen people attended the final, many of them volunteers or acquaintances of the club's managers.Hours later, when the victorious players honked horns and waved French flags as they circled the town's central plaza, most of those sitting outdoors stared at them, intrigued but unaware of what they were celebrating.â€œWe've got prizes, compliments and promises, but many players wonder why, after a second title, there isn't more local enthusiasm,â€ said Mr. Rochas, the club's vice president.In 2017, the club received a European Citizen's Prize, awarded each year by the European Parliament to citizens or organizations that promote cross-border cooperation and understanding. But it still lacks the resources and volunteers it would need to play in France's national cricket league, as its victories at the regional level qualify it to do.Perhaps even more critical is the need to attract local players, some team members said. So far, a doctor living in St.-Omer is the only French-born player out of 30.â€œWe can't only play among foreigners. We need new French recruits,â€ said Tazim Abbas, a 19-year-old player from Pakistan. â€œOtherwise, who will keep the club running when I have a job and a life here?â€"
"The threat of anti-Muslim bigotry in Britain has been growing, and some politicians from the governing Conservative Party have been encouraging it.In a newspaper column in August, Boris Johnson, the former Conservative foreign secretary — who is chummy with Steve Bannon and fancies himself an upper-class English version of President Trump — compared Muslim women who wear face veils to â€œbank robbersâ€ and â€œletter boxes.â€Shaun Bailey, a politician from the Conservative Party, who has been chosen as its candidate for London's mayoral election, took 13 years to offer a conditional apology for writing in a 2005 pamphlet that the effect of celebrating Muslim and Hindu festivals is to â€œrob Britain of its communityâ€ without which â€œwe slip into a crime-riddled cesspool.â€In September, in what police are investigating as a hate crime, a car ran over pedestrians outside an Islamic center in Cricklewood, a northwest London neighborhood, injuring two people. A report in July by Tell MAMA, a group that monitors anti-Muslim activity, revealed a 26 percent increase in Islamophobic attacks in 2017. The victims were mostly Muslim women. A recent survey by the think tank British Future found that whenever Islam was mentioned by those interviewed, it was â€œalmost always in a negative context.â€Except, that is, on the cricket field. Perhaps surprisingly, the England cricket team, that most traditional of national institutions, has been leading the way in creating a more inclusive environment for its Muslim players.Team sports are all about creating a cohesive identity. But instead of expecting every player to conform to the cultural codes of the team, the England and Wales Cricket Board acknowledges that every player is different and needs to be treated individually. In doing so it has made the team stronger. The Conservative Party, and indeed Britain as a whole, could learn a lot from the cricket team's approach. The life and cricket career of Moeen Ali, a visibly Muslim player on the England cricket team, illustrates how both the country and its minorities thrive when British institutions accommodate the religious and cultural needs of minorities.Mr. Ali, who is a religious Muslim, wears a luxurious beard, prays in the dressing room and fasts during five-day Test cricket matches, symbolizes something bigger than the game. Every time Mr. Ali plays for England, British Muslims like me are willing him to succeed.When someone as devout as Mr. Ali thrives in the pressure cooker of professional sport, it lends hope for a better future to 2.8 million British Muslims. Mr. Ali was born in the city of Birmingham, in 1987 to British-Pakistani parents.His grandfather Shafayat Ali was part of a wave of South Asian migrants who moved to Birmingham and cities in the north of England like Bradford and Manchester to work in the manufacturing sector. His grandmother was an Englishwoman named Betty Cox who met Shafayat Ali at a factory in Birmingham in the late 1940s. His family tree, Mr. Ali says, â€œis a bridge between England and Pakistan.â€Mr. Ali made his debut for the England Test team in 2014. He established himself as a cricketing force by winning a dramatic victory for England in a match against South Africa in July 2017. Mr. Ali took three wickets in three balls — the first England spinner to take a hat trick in 79 years.After his match-winning performance, the players gathered on the grass for the traditional group photograph and Champagne-spraying celebrations. Mr. Ali, who doesn't touch alcohol, stood apart. Alastair Cook, the great batsman and former captain of the team, noticed his isolation. â€œMake sure Moeen gets in the picture first and then we can spray afterward,â€ Mr. Cook insisted. And Mr. Ali was welcomed into the frame, he recalled in his recently published memoir, â€œMoeen.â€Not everyone in the game had been so considerate. When Mr. Ali was first selected for the national team, the veteran sports columnist Michael Henderson took issue with his long beard, remarking that he was â€œopting to stand outâ€ and queried why he said he felt like he was representing Muslims when he played.Mr. Henderson was reframing an old debate about national identity set off by the Conservative politician Norman Tebbit, who in 1990 said that British South Asians and Afro-Caribbeans should support the England cricket team — not India, Pakistan or the West Indies. â€œAre you still harking back to where you came from?â€ Mr. Tebbit asked dismissively.Mr. Tebbit's intervention was especially fraught because cricket is played almost exclusively by countries that were once part of the British Empire. Cheering on the great West Indies or Pakistan teams of the 1980s was a way for ethnic-minority Britons to express their resentment of an England that they felt did not welcome them. It was also a way of retaining emotional ties to their parents' countries.Mr. Ali's dual inheritances do not fit the simplicity of the Tebbit identity test. Adil Rashid, another Pakistani-origin cricketer who recently became a regular on the England Test match squad, speaks in a broad Yorkshire accent, while Mr. Ali has a Midlands accent. Yet in the dressing room, they chat about tactics in the Kashmiri language of their ancestors.English cricket realized that it can only be strengthened by an open-minded attitude to minorities. Nasser Hussain, the son of an Indian father and English mother, captained the team from 1999 to 2003. Mr. Ali himself is not expected to keep quiet over issues he feels strongly about. When he was censured by the International Cricket Board for wearing â€œSave Gazaâ€ and â€œFree Palestineâ€ wristbands during a 2014 test cricket match, the England and Wales Cricket Board supported his right to free expression.Mr. Ali's easygoing demeanor has made him a favorite in the dressing room and with the fans. After a bad run earlier this year, he was dropped from the team. But he worked hard and fought back to earn a spot and won the title of Man of the Match, for his outstanding performance in a match against India in September.He was motivated to put in his best for the team by that moment in 2016 when Mr. Cook ensured that he was included in the celebrations and the group photograph. â€œI felt this was a team I could give anything for,â€ he remarked. The Conservative Party and the country at large could learn from Mr. Cook's and Mr. Ali's example. "
"In recent days, as India and Pakistan came almost to the brink of war, the members of the Boston Gymkhana Sports Club — a cricket club that, like many in the United States, has members from both countries — did not interrupt their usual social calendar.Some members were on edge about the escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations, which began two weeks ago when a suicide bombing in the disputed region of Kashmir killed more than 40 Indian soldiers. And many had sharply different perspectives on the conflict.Rajiv Shah, 46, who emigrated in 1999 from the Indian state of Gujarat, was approving when the Indian government conducted airstrikes in Pakistan, claiming to kill a large number of terrorists.Others felt that India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, was exploiting the situation, intentionally ramping up tensions in hopes of solidifying his support in the coming elections.At least a couple of members gave some credence to conspiracy theories that the Indian government itself might be behind the terrorist attack.And yet, there was a birthday to celebrate: The club's founder, Bikram Singh, was turning 53. The club members, accustomed to setting aside their differences and carrying on with their friendships at times of heightened hostility between the two countries, were planning a party.â€œNo matter what, we live and play or interact with people that we completely disagree with sometimes, but we still manage,â€ said Mr. Singh, whose family is from the northwestern Indian state of Punjab.The past week has seen some people in India and Pakistan openly root for war, while others have urged the country's leaders to find a way to end the crisis. (Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan — himself a former cricket star — made a move in that direction, and gained an international publicity coup, when he released an Indian pilot whom Pakistan had captured, reducing tensions somewhat, although shelling continued along the disputed border.)In the United States, sentiments were similarly mixed: Some Indian-Americans protested outside the Pakistani consulates in New York and Chicago, accusing the country of harboring terrorists, while others joined marches for peace.But among the members of the Boston Gymkhana Sports Club, there was no palpable unease as they gathered on Sunday evening at Mr. Singh's comfortable home in Norfolk, about 40 minutes southwest of Boston. Mr. Singh, who had just returned from a vacation to India — his trip home took some 51 hours, because his flight had to be diverted to avoid Pakistani airspace, he said — wore a saffron-colored vest and sipped whiskey. Vegetable fritters and other appetizers were laid out, and club members and their wives and a few teenage children greeted each other with hugs.The roughly 40 guests were a subset of the cricket club's membership, which Mr. Singh said is between 150 and 200, depending on the year. The majority are from India; Mr. Singh estimated that about 10 percent are from Pakistan.Over all, several members agreed, the club members do not discuss the decades-long conflict between India and Pakistan much.â€œSome of it is deferential, so you obviously try not to hurt the other person's feelings,â€ Nafis Ahmad, 51, who is from Karachi, explained the day before the party. He added: â€œOur club is kind of gentlemanly in a sense. We try not to delve into topics that are too controversial.â€This is striking given how much time the club members spend together. Games last some six hours, and afterward, the club members will often spend another six hours eating dinner and drinking together. In the winter, when they don't play cricket, they play poker in a large upstairs room in Mr. Singh's home, decorated with dozens of cricket trophies and nearly as many bottles of liquor. (The amount of socializing has led the club to adopt an unofficial motto: â€œWe also play cricket.â€)There have been times when geopolitics have briefly intruded on the club's bonhomie, and early on, one episode led to a member being ejected. That was in 1999, shortly after Mr. Singh had founded the club, and when it had only one or two Pakistani members.That spring and summer, India and Pakistan briefly went to war in Kashmir. Mr. Singh said he received a phone call one morning from an Indian-American club member demanding that the Pakistani members be kicked out.Mr. Singh said he was stunned. â€œI said, â€˜You know what? You're not going to play in our club anymore — that's not the kind of club we are.' â€On Sunday, at a reporter's request, a group of the party guests agreed to move into the poker room to discuss the most recent escalation. There was no one from Kashmir, the region at the center of the rivalry, whose residents are often left out of the debate about the two country's actions. It wasn't long before differences emerged.Omar Virk, 28, who grew up outside Lahore and came here three and a half years ago to study for his bachelor's degree at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said he believed that India's prime minister was purposefully stoking the conflict.â€œModi is trying to push into this one,â€ he said. â€œYou know how he won the last election, right? He was anti-Pakistan from the start.â€â€œI disagree with that,â€ said Moin Ghouse, 38, who is from the Indian city of Hyderabad.â€œI think Modi is politically savvy enough to understand the risks involved in going for an all-out war,â€ Mr. Ghouse added.Mr. Virk began talking about theories he said were being discussed on Indian television suggesting that Mr. Modi himself was behind the terrorist attack. â€œNobody can prove that,â€ he added, though he said he had been thinking the same thing.Others said the idea was absurd.Mr. Shah, the club member from Gujarat — Mr. Modi's home state, where he was chief minister in 2002 when deadly religious riots took place in which roughly a thousand people, mostly Muslims, were killed — said many Indians were thrilled that Mr. Modi had taken a stand and attacked Pakistan in response to the suicide bombing.As competing conversations broke out, Mr. Ahmad, the club member from Karachi, said he had been worried in recent days about the possibility of war, because he believed that India increasingly saw itself as a superpower.â€œI was a little unnerved that we may be — on the other side of the border, some of our brothers may be a little bit too much trigger-happy, and they would say, â€˜O.K., these guys have been doing these shenanigans for us for many, many years, let's show them.'â€One of Mr. Singh's close friends, Parak Ananta, began reminding the group that dinner was getting cold downstairs. Eventually, everyone went down to eat.Asked when club members last had a conversation like this, Mr. Singh said that it had been years ago, when he started a Facebook group for club members and others to discuss a series of India-Pakistan cricket games. Mr. Ananta had thought starting the group was a bad idea — that passions would run too high, and people would say things they would regret. Looking back, Mr. Ananta said that he felt he had been right; the conversation had damaged some friendships.â€œWe have to be real sometime,â€ Mr. Singh insisted. â€œWe can't just be in a cocoon all the time.â€Mr. Ananta disagreed. â€œEven between wife and husband there are certain things that are taboo,â€ he said."

"MUMBAI — Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli has hinted at making wholesale changes to his team after Tuesday's Indian Premier League (IPL) defeat to Rajasthan Royals left them the only winless side in the Twenty20 tournament.With both sides without a victory in their first three matches, it was the Royals who broke their duck with a seven-wicket win in Jaipur, spearheaded by Shreyas Gopal's 3-12 with his leg-spin and a 59 from Jos Buttler's bat.Kohli dropped his Rajasthan counterpart Ajinkya Rahane on one and his team dropped three more catches to aid their opponents' chase. Rahane went on to make 22 and combined with Buttler to give Rajasthan a brisk opening stand of 60.""In a tournament like the IPL, when the team doesn't have any momentum, things can get difficult,"" Kohli said after the game. ""The guys can get a little tight in the field. Bodies can get stiff. A bit of nervousness as well. ""Look we have to consider everything. The team hasn't got off to a great start. These things (dropped catches) look really bad when they happen in this sort of phase for a team.""Despite having Kohli and talismanic South African AB de Villiers in their ranks, Bangalore's batting has failed twice in four matches. They were all out for 70 in the IPL opener against Chennai and bundled out for 113 on Sunday against the Sunrisers, losing by a huge margin of 118 runs. They fared better against Rajasthan, scoring 158-4, but it still proved inadequate.""This tournament is not that long,"" Kohli said. ""You have to be on the eight ball. You have to think on your feet. You have to think of the best possible combination going forward. ""We will definitely sit down and consider talking about what we can do. What can we do to get the balance right. Hopefully get some fresh guys in and they can make some cracking match-winning performances for us and get the team going.""Kohli, who also skippers India in all three formats, has his work cut out for him if he is to lead Bangalore to a first IPL title after losing their first four games. ""We have 10 games to go. If we start turning things around pretty soon, then we can get on a roll as well. We have to keep believing as a side,"" he said.

"(Reuters) - As the heavyweights of international cricket set their sights on lifting the World Cup at Lord's in the English summer, Zimbabwe are confronted with the reality that for the first time in four decades they won't feature in the showpiece event.Instead of plotting upsets on cricket's biggest stage, they will be playing for pride at home in a low-key series starting April 10. They will be playing the United Arab Emirates â€“ the same team that deprived them of a World Cup berth by way of an unexpected three run victory in last year's qualifying tournament.Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) have increasingly struggled to schedule high quality fixtures as their financial position worsens.Touring depends on the agreeability of foreign boards â€“ a tour of India slated for this month was quietly shelved earlier in the year â€“ while hosting top-ranked teams is expensive.In a statement, ZC said that a recently proposed one-day international tour by Afghanistan wasn't viable, despite the boards agreeing to share expenses, because of ""the prohibitive costs of broadcasting the matches live on television"".The situation has left Zimbabwe, who last played at international level four months ago during a tour of Bangladesh, sliding further away from the mainstream and into cricket's second tier.After the UAE series, their next assignment will be a limited-overs tour of the Netherlands in June.DOMESTIC CRICKETThe desperate economic state of the country, where inflation has now reached a decade-high 59.39 percent on the back of foreign currency shortages, has impacted cricket operations at all levels.Zimbabwe's provincial first-class tournament, the Logan Cup, is contested by four franchise teams and provides a vital proving ground for players with national team ambitions â€“ when it's not being disrupted.""It's really important playing club and in particular franchise cricket as that's the build up to the international stage for us"", wicketkeeper Regis Chakabva, 31, told Reuters.""As players we always want to play more games but unfortunately this season has been really short for us.""The 2018-19 season featured just 12 matches. One match was postponed for two months, while two matches were abandoned after a 150 percent increase in fuel prices spurred civil unrest in the capital city, Harare.""Nothing beats game time and hopefully the administration resolves that next season"", the test centurion concluded.Before the season commenced, ZC abolished the Rising Stars team â€“ an academy initiative designed to give young players extra exposure. With fewer teams, Zimbabwe's small talent pool is less thinly spread. However, the number of matches each team played reduced from eight to six.Ryan Burl, who featured regularly for the Rising Stars after making his one-day international debut in 2017, says that prior to the Logan Cup he had never played a game of cricket longer than two days.""It was completely new to me, and I loved it from my first game"", the 24-year-old told Reuters.""When I left high school, I used to be quite an aggressive batter who played shots from ball one. But this long format found a whole new side to me which I never knew existed â€“ being patient and understanding the game better.""CLUB CRICKETThe country's economic woes hit cricket hardest at grassroots level.Harare's premier club competition, the Vigne Cup, featured four divisions at the turn of the century. Now it can only sustain two.As long-established clubs have slipped out of existence, the league has experienced a rise in the number of nomadic teams. Of the eight clubs in the first division, only two maintain their own venues. This has resulted in a phenomenon of having more teams than grounds to play on, which causes challenges for fixture fulfillment.""Here in Zimbabwe most clubs do not have grounds"", said Daniel Jakiel, 28, a fast bowler from the itinerant Rainbow Cricket Club.Teams like Rainbow rely on schools or the remaining established clubs, Takashinga and Old Hararians, making their facilities available.""Some of the clubs, they came from their own areas so they have their grounds. But some of the clubs, like us, we are based in Harare town so we don't have a ground yet.""Jakiel, who works as a legal clerk, acknowledges the sacrifice that club cricketers must make in a country with more than 80 percent unemployment.""It's difficult sometimes, but I have to try to manage my time and balance my practise and work"", he said.""Some of the players, they might have problems (with) transport and kit as well. Here it's difficult to buy kit when you are not working. So those are some of the challenges they face, most players.""Despite the hardships that players at all levels face, their unwavering love of cricket serves as a beacon of hope for the future of the game in Zimbabwe.

"WELLINGTON — New Zealand Cricket have cancelled their under-19 team's scheduled tour of Bangladesh in the wake of last month's mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch.The decision had been reached with agreement of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, NZC Chairman Greg Barclay said in a statement on Monday.Barclay added that both NZC and the BCB had agreed that proceeding with the April tour would be ""insensitive and inappropriate"" so soon after the shooting that left 50 people dead.Several of the victims of the March 15 attack were originally from Bangladesh.The south Asian nation's senior men's cricket team also narrowly avoided being caught up in the shooting as a number of their players headed to one of the mosques for Friday prayers before the third test against New Zealand.The third test, which had been scheduled to start at nearby Hagley Oval the following day, was cancelled and the Bangladesh team left the country.""We have conveyed our deep sense of regret over the circumstances leading to this mutual decision, and the BCB have been both understanding and generous in response,"" Barclay said.""NZC have nothing but respect for the BCB and believe this development has only served to bring our countries closer together, and to strengthen our bond through cricket.""

"(Reuters) - Former Australian bowler and influential coach Bruce Yardley died on Wednesday at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer.Playing at a time when the test landscape was dominated by fast-bowlers, Yardley started out as a medium-pacer himself before switching to off-spin midway through his career and earned his test debut for Australia at the age of 30.Using a distinctive long run-up better associated with pace bowling and employing his middle finger rather than his index finger to get the ball to turn, Yardley went on to take 126 wickets for Australia in 33 test matches.He also picked up 344 wickets in a first class career that spanned 24 years.""Bruce was a significant figure in Australian cricket, contributing in many ways on and off the field,"" Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said in a statement.""As a player, it took him more than 10 years of persistence playing first class and Premier cricket to find the art of off-spin, earning him a test debut at the age of 30.""Off the field, Bruce had an infectious personality and was regarded as one of the best spin-bowing coaches in the world, coaching Sri Lanka and mentoring the greatest test wicket-taker of all time, Muttiah Muralitharan.""Yardley coached the Sri Lankan team in the late 1990s and defended Muralitharan when the Sri Lankan, who has a record 800 test wickets, was investigated for having an illegal action in 2004.""Very sad to hear about the passing of Bruce Yardley,"" former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said on Twitter.

"MELBOURNE — Steve Smith and David Warner may wake with some relief on Thursday as they greet the final day of their ball-tampering bans but the anniversary of their humiliation will otherwise be a sombre milestone for Australia's cricket fans.Much has changed since Cricket Australia slapped former captain Smith and his deputy Warner with 12-month suspensions for the Cape Town scandal, while giving Cameron Bancroft a lighter nine-month sentence as the rookie opener caught up in a plot driven by others.Captains, coaches and a string of senior cricket executives have left or been sent packing, their replacements pledging to win back fans with fair play as much as series wins and silverware.Bancroft, the man who hastily trousered a piece of sandpaper in the Newlands field to try to hide his team's shame, has been named captain of English county side Durham, three months after fingering Warner as the ball-tampering mastermind in a TV interview in December.The more circumspect Warner has largely kept his counsel while returning to one of cricket's biggest stages at the Indian Premier League, smashing 85 in a 53-ball blitz in his first outing for Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday.Smith also returned to the IPL spotlight in defeat for the Rajasthan Royals, joining Warner on a mission to reclaim a spot in the one-day international team he once captained in the leadup to the showpiece World Cup in England.Efforts to smooth the pair's rehabilitation have been in train for months, and culminated in a reunion with Aaron Finch's squad in the United Arab Emirates a week-and-a-half ago.""There were a lot of big hugs and cuddles,"" Warner said in a curated video published by Cricket Australia. ""It's like we didn't really leave, the boys were very accepting of us coming in and with open arms.""Pundits have questioned whether all is really forgiven in a playing group who were left to rebuild Australia's shattered brand and absorb a series of humbling defeats without two of their best batsmen.Yet none of the players have expressed reservations and many have argued Smith and Warner have ""done their time"".""It'd be silly not to use them,"" Finch said of the pair who boast over 200 matches and 22 centuries between them in one-day internationals.Smith and Warner's former team mates may have already moved on but fans the world over have not forgotten Cape Town.Sections of the Jaipur crowd jeered Smith when he played for Rajasthan on Monday, and he and Warner can expect heat from English crowds should they play at the World Cup.The hyper-aggressive teams they once led now have a very different timbre.The ugly verbal attacks and off-field confrontation that blighted the South Africa test series have disappeared, with Paine-led Australia hosting test series against India and Sri Lanka in good spirit over the home summer.Governing body Cricket Australia (CA) was also shaken by Cape Town, with a slew of executives leaving or shown the door after a scathing cultural review.New CA boss Kevin Roberts has treaded carefully since taking over from long-serving CEO James Sutherland in October, while trying to shift Australia's focus forward rather than backward.""It was a year on Sunday since the shattering events of Cape Town. The public outcry was really confronting, but it also reinforced how much the game means to so many people,"" Roberts said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday.""In relation to Australia's men's and women's teams, our goal will always be to win, but we now have a non-negotiable expectation to compete with respect and strive to win with honour.""With the one-day World Cup starting end May and the Ashes in August, winning may be Australia's best hope of banishing the ghosts of Newlands, with or without the help of Smith and Warner.

"(Reuters) - England's Jos Buttler has vowed to make sure he is never dismissed by a ""Mankad"" run out again after losing his wicket that way for the second time in his career during an Indian Premier League (IPL) game last week.The Rajasthan Royals batsman was run out on 69 while backing up at the non-striker's end as Kings XI Punjab's Ravichandran Ashwin chose to whip off the bails instead of completing his delivery as Buttler stepped out of the crease.The 28-year-old was dismissed the same way when England played Sri Lanka in 2014, although in that case spinner Sachithra Senanayake had warned Buttler twice for backing up too far.""I must be the only person to get out twice in that way. I'll make sure it never happens again,"" Buttler told the Daily Mirror.""I didn't like what happened and I didn't agree with it, but what can you do?""The dismissal, named after India bowler Vinoo Mankad who ran out Australia's Bill Brown in similar fashion in 1947, is permitted under cricket's laws but viewed by many as going against the spirit of the game.The Marylebone Cricket Club, the authority on the laws of cricket, said the dismissal was not ""within the spirit of the game"" after reviewing footage of the incident.""I was really disappointed with it, I didn't like the style of it,"" Buttler added. ""I just thought it was a bad precedent at the start of the tournament.""What was more disappointing is that suddenly over the next two games I found myself being really conscious of it and it's quite distracting.""I think if you look at the footage, probably the wrong decision was made because at the time he was expected to release the ball I was in my crease.""Buttler, who has made two fifties in the IPL this season, is back in action when the Royals take on Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday.

"MELBOURNE — Injury troubles have kept James Pattinson out of the Australian test side for three years but the fast bowler issued a timely reminder to selectors ahead of the Ashes as he guided Victoria to their fourth Sheffield Shield title in five years on Sunday.Having grabbed three wickets in the first innings against Queensland, the Melbourne man tore through the top order in a devastating spell, his match haul of 7-71 leaving him with 26 wickets at an average of 18.92 for the competition.With first-choice quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood battling injuries, 28-year-old Pattinson will look to continue his revival when he heads to England to play for Nottinghamshire in the county championship.Once seen as a potential 100-test player, Pattinson returned to first class cricket for the first time in 15 months in November having undergone major back surgery.The paceman played the last of his 17 tests away to New Zealand in February 2016 but has remained patient and determined through a number of injury setbacks.""It's been a journey to get to this position over the last few years and at times I thought I would never be back,"" said Pattinson, who has suffered a litany of back problems and soft tissue injuries through his stop-start career.""I never doubted my ability when I could get back and bowl.""All the hard work, all the doubts that creep in to your mind, these are times that make it worth it.""Selector Trevor Hohns was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to watch the Shield final and would have likely been impressed by the performance of the once-menacing Pattinson, who has 70 test wickets at an average of 26.15.""We'd love to see him (with Victoria) for every game but I think he deserves to be with the big boys as opposed to playing with us,"" said Victoria captain Travis Dean.Test cricket would be a big step up from the loads bowled in Shield cricket, and Pattinson will have to get through the county season unscathed to be considered for the Ashes starting in August.""They have never really had an issue with the way I bowl, it's just about staying on the park,"" Pattinson said of the national selectors.""I need to get through a few more games ... The test will come once I start bowling more. I have spoken to the selectors in recent times about the Ashes and that's my goal."" (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford)"
"MELBOURNE — Australia bowling coach Troy Cooley has no plans to carry on the role full-time after this year's Ashes series and expects to head back to his usual job at the national cricket academy after plotting England's downfall.Cooley, who helped England win back the urn in the memorable 2005 series, left his post as head bowling coach at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane to join the Australian camp for the recent one-day series against Pakistan and India.Although announced as bowling coach for the Ashes last week, Cooley confirmed he would be in the role for a good time, not a long time.""Ashes, it gets me out of bed in the morning,"" the 53-year-old said in Dubai, where Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash of Pakistan on Sunday.""It's one of the best jobs going around.""You could not pass up an opportunity like this.""But I would probably be more inclined to continue the (NCC) head coaching role.""Cooley replaced David Saker, Australia's last full-time bowling coach, for the India and Pakistan ODI series, but governing body Cricket Australia have yet to decide on a long-term appointment.As one of the principal architects of England's droughtbreaking 2-1 series win in 2005, Cooley's involvement is a boost for an Australian team hoping to claim the urn on English soil for the first time since 2001.He said reverse swing might not have as much of an impact on the series as it had in 2005 because of stadium upgrades.""It really depends on Mother Nature,"" Cooley said.""We'll exploit that if we get an opportunity to, depending on the conditions.""But a lot of English grounds now have got irrigation and been redone, so you don't have those real dry outfields like in '05.""Even with first choice quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood currently injured, Australia are unlikely to be short of quality pacemen.Cooley said Australia's whole attack would need to be versatile to have success in England when the series gets underway in August.""The fast bowlers and the spinners have got to work as a team and I know 'JL' (head coach Justin Langer) is really keen to make sure that pack mentality is tight and they're covering all bases,"" he said.""So if we rock up and get a green seamer or a dry one we've got enough skillset and enough coverage to be able to take 20 wickets.""

"(Reuters) - Australia's top four batsmen all posted half-centuries as they beat Pakistan by 20 runs to complete a 5-0 one-day series whitewash in Dubai on Sunday.Sent out to bat, Australia finished with a commanding total of 327-7 on a flat Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch.Opener Usman Khawaja was all set for his third hundred this month but fell for 98 to fast bowler Usman Shinwari.Glenn Maxwell, meanwhile, celebrated his 100th one-day international with an impressive 33-ball 70, Shaun Marsh scored 68-ball 61 and captain Aaron Finch made 69-ball 53 to put Australia in control at halfway stage.It was Maxwell's third consecutive 50-plus score, giving him a timely boost in intense competition for the middle-order spots for the World Cup starting on May 30 in England and Wales.Khawaja and Finch laid the foundations with a solid 134-run opening stand but it was Maxwell's 10 fours and three sixes that helped Australia to 107 runs in the last 10 overs.Pakistan lost opener Abid Ali, who scored a century on debut in the last match, for a golden duck in the first over but Shan Masood and Haris Sohail got the run chase on track with a steady partnership of 108 for the second wicket.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa celebrated his 27th birthday by trapping Masood (50) leg-before to give Australia a crucial breakthrough, before Maxwell's off-spin removed Mohammad Rizwan for 12.Sohail smashed his second century of the series but holed out to paceman Kane Richardson for 130 when the run-rate pressure forced him to go for broke in the 41st over.Captain Imad Wasim scored an unbeaten 50 to reduce the deficit but the task proved too big for Pakistan who finished 307-7 after 50 overs.""It's very satisfying,"" said Australia coach Justin Langer.""We came here in September and Pakistan showed us how to play cricket (with 3-0 Twenty20 series win). We worked really hard in the summer to turn it around, and 5-0 is a great result.""Everyone in world cricket is working towards the World Cup, and it's always nice to go into the tournament with confidence.

"MUMBAI — David Warner celebrated the end of his year-long ban from international cricket with a match-winning innings of 69 on Friday, helping his Indian Premier League franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad overhaul a steep target against the Rajasthan Royals.Former Australia captain Steve Smith and his deputy Warner were slapped with 12-month suspensions from international cricket last year for their involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in the Cape Town test against South Africa.Two months out from the World Cup in England, Warner showed he had lost none of his marauding form at the top of the order by smashing 85 in 53 balls in Hyderabad's opening IPL match against Kolkata Knight Riders last Sunday.He continued in the same vein against Rajasthan, the day after his international ban ended, scoring 69 off 37 deliveries as his team chased down their opponents 198-2, built on Sanju Samson's unbeaten knock of 102.Hyderabad needed a fast start to their innings and Warner, who missed the 2018 IPL because of the ban, obliged with a half-century off 26 deliveries.""We got off to a good start and kept (going) on with that adrenaline,"" Warner said after the match. ""As a batsman when your adrenaline is running you are in a mood.""Warner's form is timely as he attempts to win a place in Aaron Finch's World Cup squad, four years after being Australia's second-highest run scorer behind former captain Smith during the team's run to the title on home soil.Finch said on Thursday selectors would find it hard to fit everyone in to the 15-man squad, with his current one-day side resurgent as they dominate Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.However, Glenn Maxwell, who struck 98 as Australia completed a six-run win over Pakistan in Dubai on Friday, said he looked forward to Warner and Smith joining the ODI squad.""He's on fire over there and it's good to see, looking forward to them joining up with us,"" said Maxwell after Australia took a 4-0 lead in the five-match series.""They're certainly going to get plenty of cricket over there in the IPL.""Left-hander Warner hit nine fours, three of them in England all-rounder Ben Stokes' first over, and two sixes in his knock and by the time he fell to Stokes, his team had already rocketed to 110 in less than 10 overs. ""When a player like David Warner bats like that, there's very less margin as a bowler,"" Rajasthan captain Ajinkya Rahane said.""I don't think the bowlers did anything wrong, their batsmen did very well. They didn't lose any momentum throughout when they were batting.""Smith did not have an opportunity to bat as his side promoted Stokes ahead of him at number four.

""This is first time going into a World Cup England have such a settled squad. Everything looks great from the outside, they have every option covered.""England failed to cope with raised expectations at the 2017 Champions Trophy when they lost to eventual winners Pakistan in the semi-finals.Cook is positive such blips can only make a team mentally stronger.Since the start of last year, England have come out on top in bilateral ODI series against World Cup holders Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India.""They had that blip in the (2017) Champions Trophy, where they lost in the semi-final to Pakistan when they were favourites, but you need those lows to be able to grow as a side,"" he added.""They are favourites. This is a great opportunity for Eoin (Morgan) and the guys to play some fantastic cricket. ""There are match winners throughout the squad, there are batsmen that can win games on their own, and over the last six or eight months the bowling has really come on.

"NEW DELHI — Former captain Steve Smith laid to rest any concerns about his fitness and form ahead of the naming of Australia's World Cup squad with his first half century of this year's Indian Premier League on Sunday.The 29-year-old Smith, who underwent elbow surgery earlier this year, top-scored with 73 not out for Rajasthan Royals in their relatively meagre total of 139 for three in Jaipur.Smith's innings lasted just 59 balls but he was relatively circumspect at the start against some tight bowling from spinners Piyush Chawla and Sunil Narine. West Indies all-rounder Narine (47) then combined with Australia's Chris Lynn (50) in a 91-run opening partnership in 8.1 overs to set up an eight-wicket victory with 37 balls to spare. Despite the loss, Smith's innings would have pleased Australia's selectors as they mull over their squad for the defence of the one-day World Cup in England and Wales.Instead of a traditional all-out attacking innings normal in the Twenty20 format, Smith worked the ball into gaps and had scored just 39 runs from his first 40 balls before he accelerated in the final overs.The innings drew some praise from West Indies batting great Brian Lara during the commentary of the match.""He is not a big-hitter of the ball,"" Lara said. ""He's not an Andre Russell or a Ben Stokes. He gets the gaps. I respect him.""Former England captain Michael Vaughan also tweeted that a six by Smith off Narine would put to bed any concerns over the elbow.Smith's 12-month international ban for ball tampering only ended 10 days ago and he has started slowly with scores of 20, 28 and 38 in his three matches before Sunday's innings.He had been playing mostly Twenty20 tournaments around the world during the ban. He also played club cricket in Sydney before having the surgery.Both Smith and former Australia vice-captain David Warner missed last year's IPL following the imposition of the bans by Cricket Australia for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked their national team.Australia are expected to name their team for the defence of their World Cup title over the next week, with the 15-man squads needing to be finalised by April 23.India captain Virat Kohli's miserable IPL season continued on Sunday when his Royal Challengers Bangalore lost to the Delhi Capitals by four wickets, their sixth defeat in six matches this season.

"CAPE TOWN — South Africa coach Ottis Gibson knows the players he wants to travel to England for the Cricket World Cup, but injuries and loss of form have complicated his 15-man selection.South Africa, who are due to name their squad on April 18, have not lost a 50-over series in the last 12 months, winning home and away against Sri Lanka, in Australia, and at home to Pakistan and Zimbabwe.Captain Faf du Plessis has previously described what they see as their blueprint for success -- six specialist batsmen, an all-rounder at number seven, three fast bowlers and a spinner.The bowling lineup picks itself with Imran Tahir providing his controlled leg-spin, and a seam attack of Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, and one of veteran Dale Steyn or newcomer Anrich Nortje.Ngidi (side strain) and Nortje (shoulder) are currently out with injuries though, missing the Indian Premier League, and both have a history of breaking down in the recent past.""I've had 15 (players in mind) for a while now, but we've got to sit with fingers crossed,"" Gibson recently told reporters.""We've asked the guys who have gone off (to the IPL) to make sure that they still remember what the biggest picture is with regards to the Proteas setup. ""We have a camp on May 12, and we want to make sure that there are no niggling injuries. We don't want to be taking injuries into a World Cup, so hopefully that will take care of itself.""Opening batsman Hashim Amla has been a stalwart at the top of the order for the last decade, but his form in all formats has been called into question in the past year.In ODI cricket he has managed a single century in his previous 16 innings, dating back to the start of 2018, at an average of 35.26. Counting in his favour though is an impressive average of 63.44 in England.Those who have been given a run of games to contest his opening spot, Reeza Hendricks and Aiden Markram, have not grasped their opportunities despite hugely impressive domestic form. There are also questions over the number three position, with the same duo also in contention for that along with the inexperienced, but in-form, Rassie van der Dussen.Dussen made his debut less than three months ago but could be asked to play a pivotal role in one of the key batting positions in the lineup.JP Duminy, who provides a second spin option as well as being a frontline batsman, is undergoing strength training on a troublesome shoulder.

"MUMBAI — The Indian Premier League clash between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians turned out to be an engrossing contest on Thursday but it was marred by an umpiring error on the last delivery that left Virat Kohli fuming.Bangalore, led by the talismanic India skipper, needed a six off the last delivery to tie the match against Mumbai but batsman Shivam Dube could only hit Lasith Malinga's full-length delivery to long-on to lose by six runs.Replays showed the Sri Lanka fast bowler had clearly overstepped the crease for a no-ball, meaning a free hit for Bangalore.""We are playing at IPL level, not club cricket,"" a livid Kohli said at the post-match presentation. ""That's just a ridiculous call off the last ball. The umpires should have their eyes open, it was a no-ball by an inch. ""It's a completely different game altogether (with the extra delivery). So if it's a game of margins, I don't know what's happening. They should have been more sharp and more careful out there.""The no-ball would have resulted in an extra run for Bangalore and brought former South Africa batsman AB de Villiers on strike. De Villers was in scintillating form and unbeaten on 70 off 41 balls with half a dozen sixes and four fours.Thursday's loss was the second in as many matches for the Kohli-led side while Mumbai picked up their first victory.Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma, who is Kohli's deputy in India's limited-overs sides, was also unimpressed with the umpiring gaffe.""These kinds of mistakes are not good for the game of cricket,"" Sharma said. ""The players can't do much about it... but I hope they can rectify their mistakes like we do.""It's pretty simple, those decisions can cost you games. We prepare too much to win this tournament, to win games, and those kind of mistakes are not acceptable.""The controversy comes days after Ravichandran Ashwin's 'Mankad' dismissal of Jos Buttler in a match between Rajasthan and Punjab caused uproar.The tournament, however, is in rude health in terms of viewership, with the 12th edition set to surpass all previous records.

"MUMBAI — West Indies are replete with match-winners but consistency will be key to their success in English conditions at this year's World Cup, batting great Brian Lara has said.Teeming with tearaway fast bowlers and aggressive batsmen, West Indies were once considered invincible and won the opening two editions of the World Cup in 1975 and 1979.Their glory days, however, are long over and the twice winners had to go through a qualifying tournament to book their spot in the 10-team tournament in England and Wales.The last bilateral series win for West Indies, who are ranked ninth in one-day internationals, came in 2014 but they showed signs of improvement against England.Jason Holder's men drew a five-match ODI series against top-ranked England 2-2 at home recently, in a timely boost before the May 30-July 14 showpiece event.The likes of opening batsman Chris Gayle, all-rounder Andre Russell and spinner Sunil Narine are also much in demand in Twenty20 leagues across the globe.""Look at the Indian Premier League, look at the leagues around the world, we have got players that are the most wanted in the world,"" Lara, 49, told reporters in Mumbai at a promotional event last week.""We have got match-winners, but we are going to need a little more than match-winners in English conditions to win the World Cup. We need a team that can create consistency.""If we can get to the knock-out stages, we can knock out any team. We have seen that in the past. But consistency is going to take us right through to the finals.""Former West Indies captain Lara, considered one of the very best the Caribbean islands have ever produced, retired after the 2007 World Cup at home with over 10,000 runs in ODIs. He also scored close to 12,000 runs in tests.Lara credited franchise leagues like the IPL for creating interest among kids in the West Indies and giving young players a platform to showcase their talent before they graduate to international cricket.West Indies suffered 2-0 losses both in India and Bangladesh late last year but staged a spectacular turnaround in a 2-1 series win against England earlier this year.The test success augurs well for the side, who are now graduating to a level where they can be competitive against top sides at least at home, said Lara.""We had a tremendous series against England. We are laying the foundation, the confidence is there,"" Lara added. ""India may have to worry when they come there in July to play against the West Indies because they have a team now that understand the conditions, spirits are high, let's see what we can do against India.""But, four months ago in October-November we were terrible.

"MUMBAI — India captain Virat Kohli does not want performance at the ongoing Indian Premier League to determine team composition for this year's World Cup but selectors have little choice after a series of candidates failed to nail down the number four slot.Twice 50-over champions India have an otherwise settled batting line-up with a formidable top order consisting of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli himself.The selectors, however, continue to fret over who should walk out to bat after the fall of the second wicket during the May 30-July 14 showpiece tournament in England and Wales.Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Lokesh Rahul, Dinesh Karthik and Ambati Rayudu have all been trialled for the number four spot and found wanting.With the ongoing IPL the only form of cricket left before Kohli's team embarks on their World Cup campaign, the selectors maybe forced to consider the form of the players in the T20 tournament before picking the squad ahead of the April 23 deadline.""They have maintained that they won't look at IPL but it's going to be very hard,"" former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar told Reuters in a recent interview. ""There are some borderline cases, like if they are looking at Dinesh Karthik, Ambati Rayudu and Vijay Shankar or a Manish Pandey or an Ajinkya Rahane. So all these people are there and thereabout.""And if somebody has a great IPL season, it will be hard to ignore him, but they (selectors) should not actually get too carried away with what happens in the IPL.""Rayudu, 33, emerged as the most likely choice to fill the void but scores of 13, 18 and two in the first three matches of the recent home series against world champions Australia hurt his cause.Pressure is only mounting on the selectors with Rayudu, who plays for IPL champions Chennai Super Kings, scoring 28, five, one and zero in the first four matches of the tournament.Manjrekar felt India were back to square one with no more ODIs scheduled before the World Cup in England and Wales, where the team will be looking to add to their 1983 and 2011 triumphs.India's limited-overs vice-captain, Rohit, believes inputs from Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri should determine the selection of the final 15.""With their inputs, the selectors will keep an eye on what is happening with those guys during the IPL,"" Rohit, who leads the Mumbai Indians side in the IPL, told reporters at the launch of cricket.com website on Thursday. ""Although I feel IPL shouldn't be the criterion for team selection. We have played enough international matches to see where each individual stands.""You can't select a 50-overs format team based on a 20-overs franchise competition. IPL is a different ball game, it's franchise cricket.""Yes form matters a lot. But in this last four years we have played enough ODI matches, we have played enough T20 internationals.

"WELLINGTON — Less than 18 months ago, New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham had become so disaffected with cricket he would open the curtains on match day and hope it was raining.A timely chat with Heath Mills, the head of the New Zealand players' union, however, ended his thoughts about retirement and ultimately propelled him back into the national side and then on Wednesday into the country's World Cup squad.""Opening the shades and hoping it was raining is not the ideal way to begin a day of cricket,"" Neesham told reporters on Thursday, the day after he was named in the squad for the May 30-July 14 tournament in England. ""I think I needed to just have a full overhaul in the way I was approaching the game.""I actually called Heath Mills 18 months ago and told him I was going to retire. He convinced me to take a little break.""Luckily I took his advice ... and obviously since then it's been on the up and up.""With his ability to bat in the top order and bowl fast-medium pace, Neesham was once considered to be the answer to New Zealand's search for an all-rounder when he made the side in late 2012.The early stages of his career were hampered by injury, however, and in 2017 a decline with the ball saw him dropped from the national side. The following year he was removed from the central contracts list, with the message from selector Gavin Larsen that he needed to ""demand our attention again"".The power-hitting left-hander tried to respond by pushing himself to score more runs, but only piled more pressure on himself. ""I wanted to dominate and score hundreds every game and once that starts going in a downward spiral and you're not going well, you put more pressure on yourself,"" he said.""When I was the most driven, I played my worst. Trying too hard doesn't seem to help as a cricketer. ""Once I got over those feelings and began to enjoy myself again then that's when things started to get better.""Part of that process involved leaving Otago, where he had spent seven years, and move to Wellington where coach Bruce Edgar, captain Michael Bracewell and former New Zealand pace bowler Hamish Bennett all helped him regain his confidence.Since being recalled to the national side in January, the 28-year-old has played eight one-day internationals in his comeback and scored 204 runs at an average of 68, while taking 10 wickets at 22.90, enough to convince selectors he should be on the plane for England.""It was a long road back, but once I got back to scoring runs and taking wickets I knew I wasn't too far away if I put a good couple of months together,"" he added.""But to get the call, it's pretty surreal.""

"WELLINGTON — Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell was the surprise selection in New Zealand's 15-man squad for cricket's one-day World Cup later this year, despite never having played the format at international level.The 28-year-old Blundell has played just two tests, making a century on debut, and three Twenty20 internationals for New Zealand, but will serve as a backup to Tom Latham for the May 30-July 14 tournament in England and Wales.""The key for us was finding the right balance for the squad and making sure we had our bases covered for what is going to be a very competitive World Cup,"" coach Gary Stead said.""As a one-day unit we've been pretty consistent over the past few years and possess a very experienced group of core players, proven at the top level.""Blundell's last appearance for New Zealand was in a Twenty20 international against Australia in Sydney in early 2018. He did not play a single game for Wellington in New Zealand's domestic one-day competition this season.His surprise elevation into the squad is at the expense of Tim Seifert, who had been the preferred wicketkeeper in Twenty20 internationals this summer and made his one-day international debut in January against Sri Lanka.The aggressive Seifert, who can bat up and down the order, showed his potential with quickfire scores of 84 and 43 while opening against India in Twenty20 internationals in February, but broke his finger towards the end of the season.While he would have recovered for the World Cup, questions had been asked about his work with the gloves and Stead had said he would prefer to select a specialist to back up Latham, who only assumed the role in the one-day squad two years ago.Henry Nicholls had been previously mooted as a potential emergency wicketkeeper if Latham got injured, but is now expected to open the batting with Martin Guptill after Colin Munro fell out of favour.Munro still made the final 15-man squad with his ability to also bowl medium pace but is more likely to be batting cover.Ish Sodhi also won a tight selection battle with Todd Astle as the second spinner, with all-rounder Mitchell Santner the first-choice slow bowler.The choice of Sodhi over Astle was considered a far from straightforward selection battle, with both legspinners given opportunities to prove themselves in white-ball cricket over New Zealand's summer.Astle is the stronger batsman but Sodhi is considered the more attacking bowler and took 24 wickets at 21.17 in his final three first-class games in March.James Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme were named as the all-rounders, while the four frontline pace bowlers Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry were never in doubt.Squad: Kane Williamson (captain), Tom Blundell, Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Colin Munro, James Neesham, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor.

"(Reuters) - Jason Behrendorff marked his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut with two wickets on Wednesday but the Australian fast bowler knows he needs to deliver consistently to stake a claim for a Cricket World Cup spot.Mumbai Indians' Behrendorff removed Chennai Super Kings opener Ambati Rayudu and Suresh Raina with the new ball to help his side cruise to a 37-run victory.With fellow left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc expected to return to full-fitness for the World Cup, and Australia's wealth of options in the fast bowling department, Behrendorff's path to the tournament in England and Wales is far from straightforward.""My (World Cup) spot is not certainly cemented down, that's for sure,"" Behrendorff told reporters. ""Any performance here can really help me out.""My main strength is swinging the new ball up front and taking some wickets. It was good that I was able to do that tonight and keep that in front of selectors' minds... that I am still bowling well.""Behrendorff, who has 14 wickets in a short international career of 13 limited-overs matches, took a career-best 3-63 as Australia completed a 5-0 one-day series whitewash of Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.

"(Reuters) - England Women smashed over 200 runs for only the second time in a Twenty20 international as they beat Sri Lanka to complete a 3-0 series whitewash in Colombo on Thursday.Danielle Wyatt made 33-ball 51 and fellow opener Amy Jones scored 57, while Natalie Sciver and Tammy Beaumont stitched an unbroken 88-run partnership for the third wicket in the tourists' 204-2.It was England's second-highest total in the shortest format of the game behind only the world record 250-3 scored against South Africa Women last June in Taunton.Only three Sri Lankans reached double figures as they laboured to 108-6 in 20 overs, handing England a 96-run victory.The win was England's 10th in a row as they complete a successful tour of India and Sri Lanka.England were 2-0 down in the one-day series in India but won the dead rubber and went on to clinch the T20 series 3-0.Heather Knight's side continued their run of clinical performances to beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in the one-dayers that preceded the T20 clean sweep.""We talked about imposing ourselves on Sri Lanka and be quite ruthless,"" England coach Mark Robinson told the England and Wales Cricket Board website.""You've got to keep you standards as the games go on and these girls have been fantastic.""England will next host West Indies in June before taking on rivals Australia in the Women's Ashes series.

"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.There's a lot going on in Washington and the world this week, but there's also still a lot of buzz around the Green New Deal, a proposal put forth by Democrats that would reshape the American energy sector to tackle climate change and create jobs.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has said he'll bring the proposal to a vote in the coming months, a move that could force Democratic senators who are running for president to choose sides.Young people who follow the Sunrise Movement, an environmental group, have protested at government offices in recent days to demand that lawmakers vote in favor of the proposal. About 40 young people, some holding a sign saying â€œMitch, look us in the eyes,â€ were arrested Monday while holding a sit-in at Mr. McConnell's Washington office. They and other critics have denounced the vote as a ploy to divide Democrats and throw cold water on the notion of an ambitious climate plan.But activists aren't focusing solely on Republicans. Last week a group of schoolchildren confronted Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, over her resistance to the Green New Deal. Ms. Feinstein — who has a 100 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks lawmakers' environmental records — told the students the Green New Deal had little chance of passing a Republican-led Senate. Video of the encounter spread quickly on social media.For a deep dive into both the political perils of the Green New Deal and the technological hurdles of decarbonizing the United States economy, check out this piece that Trip Gabriel and I did last week. And if you're confused about what the Green New Deal is, I try to offer answers to some basic questions here.In other news, the White House announced last week that it had ended talks with California on whether the state could retain its right to set stricter automobile emissions standards than the federal government.The breakdown of negotiations, Hiroko Tabuchi and I reported, signals that the Trump administration is moving toward freezing an Obama-era rule that would have doubled fuel economy standards by 2025.And in the world of science, be sure not to miss this piece by Kendra Pierre-Louis on how extreme weather can start to feel â€¦ well, not all that extreme. Happy reading!For those of us hooked on the Netflix show â€œTidying Up with Marie Kondo,â€ this has been a season of decluttering. (If you haven't caught the bug yet, consider taking The Times's Tidy Home Challenge).But when you clear the closets of the stuff that no longer sparks joy, or simply doesn't fit, you are confronted with a pile of possessions in need of a new home. It may be tempting to take the junk to the dump, leave it on the curb or hand off a mass of unsorted goods to a charity that may not want or need them.Do the planet a favor instead. Many items can be sold, donated or recycled properly, giving them another life that will be better for the environment.Consider textiles, which accounted for 6.1 percent of municipal waste generated in the United States in 2015, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2015, Americans recycled 2.5 million tons of textiles, but sent 10.5 million tons to landfills.â€œMost people think, â€˜O.K., my clothing is stained, it's garbage,' â€ said Zach Cohen, owner of the Manhattan and Brooklyn franchises of Junkluggers, a hauling company. But there are textile companies that will take clothing, rugs and â€œanything that is made out of fabric and reuse it and recycle it,â€ he said.Your tattered towels and worn-out socks, for example, can get new life as upholstery filler or insulation.To help get your stuff to the right place, call the charity of your choice and find out what items it accepts. Some accept goods in poor condition for recycling, while others only want what's suitable for resale.You can also try specialized organizations, like Books Through Bars, a Philadelphia group that gives paperbacks to people in prison.You could donate used bras to the Bra Recyclers, which has a drop-off locator on its website. Even an old mattress need not end up in a landfill. Bye Bye Mattress, for example, recycles mattresses in some states.Have a pair of shoes you've hardly worn? Donate them to an organization like Soles4Souls. And Habitat for Humanity collects old furniture, appliances and even building materials.Other lightly used possessions may still have value, if you have the patience to sell them online.Contact your local sanitation department to find out how your city would like you to dispose of hazardous materials like latex paint, batteries and fluorescent light bulbs. Many communities have drop-off days.Even those items most likely destined for the curb, like broken appliances, may have life yet as scrap metal. The more stuff you can keep out of the landfill, the better.I've baked a lot of bread over the years, from basic Irma Rombauer white loaves to Tassajara sponge whole-wheat sourdoughs. But until a few weeks ago I had never baked cricket bread.As in, bread with ground-up crickets.Eating insects is common in many parts of the planet (the United Nations estimates that roughly one-third of the world's population consumes them, and they are offered as street food in Mexico, Thailand and other countries), but it hasn't fully caught on in the United States. Chefs are experimenting, and companies like Hotlix and EntoVida are making snacks and other products from grasshoppers, worms and other insects. (Can I interest you in a bag of mixed bugs?)There are several qualities that may make insects attractive to consumers. They pack a lot of protein and other nutrients per ounce, more than beef and some other protein sources. And they get good marks from a sustainability and climate perspective — they convert feed to protein very efficiently, use little water and produce only tiny amounts of greenhouse gases. (Unlike cattle, insects emit little to no methane.)But for many people there's an ick factor to eating them whole. To overcome that, some companies are trying other means to get crickets into our diet.That's the case with Seek Food, a small New York City company. Seek sells cricket granola and other snacks, but it also sells flour mixes, including the one I used, â€œall-purpose,â€ which combines standard wheat flour with ground crickets. â€œIt's an entry-level approach to eating crickets,â€ said Robyn Shapiro, the company's founder and chief executive.Ms. Shapiro declined to say exactly how much cricket flour her mix contains, but said it was less than 25 percent. The resulting flour has 40 percent more protein than wheat flour alone.In case you're wondering, Seek's crickets (the house cricket, or Acheta domesticus) are raised by a Texas company in stainless steel tubs. They don't need much light or water, but the warmer the environment, the faster they grow. The bugs are fed an all-grain diet but they are not that picky — they can subsist on scraps or other food waste. â€œCrickets are omnivores,â€ Ms. Shapiro said.After about six weeks, the insects are frozen until they are dead. Then they're dried and milled.The flour comes in a 12-ounce bag with a recipe on the back — a standard one that calls for yeast, sugar, water, salt and oil to make a basic loaf. The flour was darker than wheat flour, and had an odor that reminded me of malted milk powder. It mixed with the other ingredients easily, and the dough was light and easy to knead.The recipe called for eight to 10 minutes of kneading, and I could understand why. Crickets don't have any gluten, so it's important to fully develop the gluten in the wheat flour to get the dough stretchy enough for proper rising.The bread that resulted was fairly dark as well, but had a decent texture. I brought it to the office so my Climate colleagues could try it with butter and jam. It was actually pretty tasty. I'd almost call it normal. Almost.We'd love your feedback on this newsletter.

"A. The approximately 25,000 to 30,000 different species of orchid evolved along with their many pollinators — from bees, wasps and flies, to moths, butterflies, a cricket and even the occasional bird. Many of the plant's special shapes accommodate just one pollinator or a closely related group of pollinators. The flower may mimic the female of a pollinating insect, for example.Orchids make up about 10 percent of all extant flower types, but their genome suggests that they all descended from a common ancestor. These descendants developed a special deck of genetic cards that can be reshuffled to produce many variations of their characteristic flower plan. The plan involves bilateral symmetry, rather than radial symmetry; protective sepals alternating with petals; and usually a special lower petal, called a lip, that can serve as a landing pad for pollinators.Scientists say that this strategy is well suited to efficient pollen transfer, and can be adapted through evolution to attract different pollinators.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"
"Good morning. I started writing this newsletter in the weird liminal space between Australia and the United States, caught in the 24-hour miasma that haunts the travel home. I was living in the moment, but what moment it was, what day, what hour, was a mystery. Occasionally there was food, and I ate it; water, and I drank it. Sleep came and then vanished. It was a Sofia Coppola film stuck in turnaround. The script needed work.I thought about cooking a lot, how I couldn't wait to get back to the kitchen and boogie: a Reuben to eat with a cold beer; some fire-tingly Chinese lamb burgers to share with the family while the dog lolls beneath our feet; a green okonomiyaki to split with my wife; some sheet-pan chicken fajitas (above) to feed the kids and their friends.So there's that. But now that I'm back home, I'd like to make a freestyle chicken Parm as well, eat it with a glass of stringent red, try to explain this story I saw in Sydney about the pressure some are bringing on the International Cricket Council to adopt one brand of cricket ball for Test matches between countries. There are lots of new words and phrases to consider there. Leg spinner!I'd like to make bananas Foster bread pudding, if only because it asserts an excellence in American dessert and I haven't had it in ages. Also: Melissa Clark's recipe for an omelet mousseline, into which I'd like to fold some sea urchin just as if my name were Riad Nasr or Lee Hanson. What a meal that would be! Please try it in my name.Samin Nosrat's Roman egg drop soup? Francis Lam's caramelized scallions, to stir into noodles? Julia Moskin's chicken francese? Yotam Ottolenghi's one-pan pasta with harissa Bolognese? All those, too.There are many thousands more recipes to cook this week waiting for you on NYT Cooking.

Watched it on Netflix and can't get a few scenes out of my head.

"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Amid the unpredictable swirl of this year's tennis results, with 33 different champions in 33 tournaments, Ashleigh Barty provides a change of pace.The crafty 5-foot-5 Australian mixes backhand slices and drop shots with a deceptively strong serve and a knack for attacking, which is how she won the Miami Open.Barty had a career-high 15 aces and became the newest 2019 titlist on the ATP and WTA circuits by beating Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (1), 6-3 Saturday.That means there still has not been a repeat champion this year among the men or women.""Amazing, isn't it?"" Barty said. ""On the women's side, I think the level has evened out a lot, and the depth has grown over the last few years. Everyone in the draw has a legitimate chance of winning the tournament, and you try to make the most of it.""In Miami, Barty did. The former professional cricket player won her fourth tennis title and the biggest of her career to improve to 18-3 this year. At age 22, she'll rise next week to a career-high ranking of No. 9.Barty became the fifth different Miami Open women's champion in the past five years, and she's the 14th different WTA titlist in 2019.Roger Federer could become tennis' first repeat champion this year when he plays John Isner in the men's final Sunday. Federer won Dubai early this month.Barty's large repertoire of shots is both entertaining and effective, and she kept a weary Pliskova off balance while finding the open court for 41 winners.""I've always tried to bring as much variety to the court as possible,"" Barty said. ""It's about trying to neutralize what your opponent is doing. There was a phase in women's tennis of big power and first strikers, but physicality in tennis has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize the big first ball and work their way into the point.""Barty can strike quickly, too. Her surprising serve was superior in the final even though Pliskova is 8 inches taller at 6-foot-1.The Aussie won a 14-stroke rally with a nifty backhand drop shot to go up 2-1 in the tiebreaker, and she was ahead the rest of the way. She outlasted Pliskova in a 20-point game to break at the start of the second set, smacked three consecutive aces for a 3-1 lead, and won eight of the final nine points.Pliskova, seeded fifth, blamed her fade on fatigue. Because of rain delays, her semifinal win over No. 2-seeded Simona Halep lasted until early Friday morning, and she looked flat-footed in the final.""Run, run,"" Pliskova's coach, Conchita Martinez, implored during a changeover.""I was tired, super tired,"" Pliskova said. ""If I felt a little bit more fresh, it could maybe be different.""Barty made sure Pliskova never got her second wind, striking from all over the court. Among the Aussie's most acrobatic shots was a leaping overhead winner struck while backpedaling in pursuit of a lob. The crowd loved it, and so did she.""It's pretty cool to have played such a good match today in a big situation,"" she said.Barty won the Wimbledon girls' title in 2011 at age 15, but gave up tennis to play professional cricket in Brisbane before returning to the tour in 2016.This year she lost in the final at Sydney, a moment she listed as the most painful in her career. Less than three weeks later she reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the Australian Open.""That's why I love the sport,"" Barty said. ""You have these amazing moments, and you have these heartbreaking moments. But the journey in the middle is pretty bloody good.""______"
"Every month, Netflix Australia adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for March, broken down by release date.[Not the month you're looking for? Find the newest Netflix Australia guide here.]â€˜Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians' Starts streaming: March 1Following up on the success of the American football-themed â€œLast Chance U,â€ Netflix looks to India for its next multipart sports documentary. â€œCricket Feverâ€ follows a perennially successful cricket club, the Mumbai Indians, during a season when players struggled to measure up to their usual standards. Cricket fans ought to appreciate an intimate look behind the scenes, but even viewers who don't know the game well will have the chance to get caught up in the personal experiences of these athletes as they strive to remain excellent.—â€˜Losers'Starts streaming: March 1Sports' biggest failures are often held up as cautionary tales, or treated as minor characters in someone else's triumph. The docu-series â€œLosersâ€ looks back at moments when athletes flopped spectacularly, and asks how — or if — they've recovered. Some of these subjects are fairly well known, like the golfer Jean van de Velde's meltdown at the 1999 Open Championship in Scotland, or the figure skater Surya Bonaly defiantly finishing her Olympic career with an illegal move. But even the less familiar stories are fascinating, focusing not just on the worst moments of these people's lives, but on what happened next.—â€˜After Life'Starts streaming: March 8The â€œExtrasâ€ and â€œThe Officeâ€ comedian Ricky Gervais leans heavily on his offscreen reputation as a fearless and at times careless truth-teller in his new series, â€œAfter Life,â€ in which he stars as a man who reacts to his wife's death by becoming angry and unfiltered. Gervais wrote and directed the entire six-episode first season, which like his earlier TV work tries to balance brutal black comedy with earnest sentiment. But this particular show — even more than its predecessors — seems intended to deliver a heartfelt message, woven throughout its scenes of insults and profane outbursts.—â€˜Terrace House: Opening New Doors' Part 6Starts streaming: March 12The latest iteration of the Japanese reality series â€œTerrace Houseâ€ comes to an end with nine final episodes, all following a group of men and women who've agreed to live together, and to go on dates with each other, with cameras following their every move — and with a panel of commentators sharing jokes and best wishes. Unlike some reality concepts that push participants toward artificial conflict, or encourage them to lower their inhibitions, â€œTerrace Houseâ€ has won a faithful audience around the world for its refreshing mundanity. This show delivers what the reality genre has often promised: a chance to peek into ordinary people's lives and judge how they interact.—â€˜Love, Death & Robots'Starts streaming: March 15A different kind of anthology series, â€œLove, Death & Robotsâ€ compiles 18 animated short films, illustrated in wildly varying styles, but all aimed at mature audiences. The producers Tim Miller (best-known for directing â€œDeadpoolâ€) and David Fincher (the director of â€œFight Clubâ€) are shepherding a show that, like the groundbreaking â€œadult fantasyâ€ comics magazine â€œHeavy Metal,â€ will present tried-and-true horror and science-fiction concepts, with cranked-up violence, sex and surrealism.—[Want more Australia coverage? Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter here.]â€˜Queer Eye' Season 3Starts streaming: March 15The phenomenal popularity of Netflix's Marie Kondo series â€œTidying Upâ€ might be partly attributable to the earlier success of the service's â€œQueer Eye for the Straight Guyâ€ reboot, which has won audiences worldwide thanks to the cheery pleasures of an inside-and-out makeover show — where experts don't just clean out clients' closets, they also polish up their self-esteem. For the third season of â€œQueer Eye,â€ the â€œFab Fiveâ€ lifestyle experts leave the Atlanta, Georgia area behind and head into the heartland, setting up camp in Kansas City, Missouri. Their mission remains the same: to spread a little fabulousness across America, and to help people understand what really matters.—â€˜Turn Up Charlie'Starts streaming: March 15Idris Elba steps away from his usual action movie roles to take on the part of an aging DJ, who makes ends meet by providing child-care to one of his rich and famous friends. Elba (who's done quite a bit of disc-jockeying himself) also created â€œTurn Up Charlie.â€ Though he's alternated between the big and small screens throughout his career, this is the first time the star of â€œLutherâ€ and â€œThe Wireâ€ has been the lead in a half-hour, single-camera comedy series.—Also of Interestâ€œNorthern Rescueâ€ (March 1), â€œThe Orderâ€ (March 7), â€œFormula 1: Drive to Surviveâ€ (March 8), â€œImmortalsâ€ (March 8), â€œShadowâ€ (March 8), â€œIf I Hadn't Met Youâ€ (March 15), â€œGreen Doorâ€ (March 16), â€œPeaky Blindersâ€ Season 4 (March 21), â€œCarlo & Malikâ€ (March 22), â€œDelhi Crimeâ€ (March 22), â€œHistoria de un Crimen: Colosioâ€ (March 22), â€œMost Beautiful Thingâ€ (March 22), â€œSelling Sunsetâ€ (March 22), â€œOsmosisâ€ (March 29), â€œSanta Clarita Dietâ€ Season 3 (March 29), â€œTraitorsâ€ (March 29), â€œEl sabor de las margaritasâ€ (March 31) and â€œTrailer Park Boys: The Animated Seriesâ€ (March 31)—â€˜The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind'Starts streaming: March 1As a teenager, William Kamkwamba researched how to build a power-generating windmill, and used spare parts from around his family's rural Malawi home to construct a device strong enough to keep several small appliances running. These DIY turbines became an international news story, inspiring a memoir, â€œThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,â€ which has now been adapted into a movie by the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (who also plays Kamkwamba's initially skeptical father). This is Ejiofor's first feature film as a writer and director, and it's a heartwarming one, meant to inspire younger viewers, as well as to inform them about how a good education can help lift people out of poverty.—â€˜Hereditary'Starts streaming: March 5One of the more disturbing horror films of recent years, the writer-director Ari Aster's supernatural thriller â€œHereditaryâ€ stars Toni Collette as Annie Graham, a rich and successful sculptor whose combative family gradually deteriorates, going from deep dysfunction to open torment by demonic forces. A series of tragedies exposes the Graham family's dark legacy, as what starts out as a few freaky occurrences around their house blossoms into a full-on haunting. Collette gives an outstanding performance, as a woman who worries that she and her loved ones are inescapably cursed.—â€˜Juanita'Starts streaming: March 8The amazing Alfre Woodard stars in this adaptation of Sheila Williams's novel â€œDancing on the Edge of the Roof,â€ playing an exhausted working-class woman who gets tired of supporting her grown kids and decides she needs some adventure. She takes a bus to rural Montana, where she finds romance and becomes a more independent, confident version of herself. The veteran TV actor and director Clark Johnson directs â€œJuanita,â€ which plays like a combination of â€œAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymoreâ€ and â€œHow Stella Got Her Groove Back.â€—â€˜Triple Frontier'Starts streaming: March 13Although â€œTriple Frontierâ€ hasn't gotten as much advance hype as Netflix's â€œRomaâ€ or â€œThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,â€ on-the-ball film buffs have been eagerly awaiting the latest film from the â€œAll Is Lostâ€ and â€œA Most Violent Yearâ€ director J.C. Chandor. (Chandor also co-wrote the script with â€œThe Hurt Lockerâ€ screenwriter Mark Boal.) An A-list cast includes Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac and Charlie Hunnam, in a story about veterans who become soldiers of fortune, setting out to rob a drug kingpin. If it's anything like Chandor and Boal's previous work, â€œTriple Frontierâ€ should be a well-researched and finely detailed action-adventure, populated by complicated characters.—â€˜The Highwaymen'Starts streaming: March 29Flipping the script on the classic â€œBonnie and Clyde,â€ the police procedural â€œThe Highwaymanâ€ stars Kevin Costner as Frank Hamer, a real-life Texas Ranger who helped lead the hunt for the bank-robbing killers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in the 1930s. Woody Harrelson plays a former partner of Hamer who joins the crusade. The film was directed by John Lee Hancock, who previously made the crowd-pleasers â€œThe Rookieâ€ and â€œThe Blind Side.â€ He'll be blending true-crime grit with the entertainingly casual interplay of the two leads.—â€˜Jackie'Starts streaming: March 20Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar for playing the former American first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, in director Pablo Larrain and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim's impressionistic portrait of the events surrounding John F. Kennedy's funeral. â€œJackieâ€ emphasizes how the widow used her power to force President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration to respect and honor her husband's legacy. Portman plays all the angles of this character, expressing Jackie's steeliness, her sense of style, her undisguised emotion and her frustration at being underestimated. This is a richly immersive film that argues for the value of rituals, especially when it comes to grief.—â€˜The Dirt'Starts streaming: March 22The raucous life and times of the heavy metal superstars Motley CrÃ¼e were covered in lurid detail in the 2001 best-seller â€œThe Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,â€ written by the band with the help of reporter Neil Strauss. A movie adaptation, in the works for over a decade, is finally making it to the screen under the guidance of the â€œJackassâ€ co-creator Jeff Tremaine, with the rapper Colson â€œMachine Gun Kellyâ€ Baker playing Motley CrÃ¼e's rowdy drummer Tommy Lee, the â€œGame of Thronesâ€ villain Iwan Rheon as the guitarist Mick Mars, Douglas Booth as the bassist Nikki Six and Daniel Webber as singer Vince Neil.

"(Reuters) - Ashleigh Barty defeated Karolina Pliskova 7-6(1) 6-3 on Saturday to win her maiden Miami Open title and become the first Australian woman since 2013 to reach the top 10 in the world rankings. After dominating the first set tiebreak, Barty broke the big-serving Pliskova in a 12-minute game to open the second set. From there on the fatigued Czech, whose semi-final win over Simona Halep finished after 1 am local time earlier on Saturday due to rain delays, put up little resistance.Barty pumped her fists when Pliskova sent a forehand long on match point to hand the 22-year-old the biggest win of her career, which includes a $1.3 million pay check. Barty said the key to the match was extending rallies on the warm day in Southern Florida. ""It was important for me to try to make it physical,"" Barty, the first Australian to win the Miami Open singles title, said in an on-court interview. ""Kaja has the ability to really hit you off the court and take it away from you so I knew I had to have my running shoes on today to try and make as many balls as possible."" Barty fired 15 aces, with Pliskova barely making an effort to return some of them. ""I tried to make the most of it,"" she said of playing an exhausted opponent. ""You don't get these opportunities every single day and it was important for me to continue and try to do the right things and enjoy the moment as well.""Pliskova, who will rise to world number four on Monday, praised her conqueror. ""I'll make it quick because I'm very tired and it was a long two weeks,"" the 27-year-old said.""Congrats to Ashleigh.

"BANGALORE — West Indies finisher Andre Russell continued his destructive Indian Premier League form with an unbeaten 48 off 13 deliveries to lead the Kolkata Knight Riders to a five-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday. Twice a world champion in the Twenty20 format, Russell hit seven sixes from nine balls in one purple patch as he drove his side to the win with five balls to spare, keeping Virat Kohli's Challengers winless in five matches in the process. Kohli (84) and South African AB de Villiers (63) had combined for 108 of the home side's 205 for three but hopes of a first victory were dashed when their death bowlers were unable to contain Russell.The 30-year-old Jamaican all-rounder, who has now hit a remarkable 207 runs off 77 balls with 22 sixes in four matches, came out to bat with his side needing 68 runs from 26 balls and proceeded to flay the bowling around the Chinnaswamy. ""I was watching on the tellie upstairs so I kind of knew what the wicket was doing,"" said Man of the Match Russell.""Sixty off 20 odd balls is not going to happen every day so we had to make sure we put our bodies on the line and I didn't quit. I trust my strength and I trust my power and I have a good bat speed so I trust that as well."" The home side were not helped by pacemen Mohammed Siraj being suspended midway through the 18th over for bowling a second beamer and Kohli said they deserved their place at bottom of the IPL standings. ""If we bowl like that, (and) don't show composure in pressure moments, we deserve to be where we are in the table,"" the India captain said.""There's no rocket science behind it. We haven't played the kind of cricket we should be playing at the level of the IPL and if you bowl like that, with not enough bravery in the crunch moments, then it's always going to be difficult when you have power-hitters like Russell in the opposition.""Russell, who struggled with knee problems at the back end of last year, will be hoping his sensational Twenty20 form will carry over to the 50-overs World Cup in England and Wales, which starts at the end of next month.

"MELBOURNE — Australian Rules players will tear through a banner of hateful tweets before a top flight match on Friday as part of a campaign against online bullying.The indigenous game has been rocked by a string of social media controversies in recent weeks, with Aboriginal players suffering racist taunts and a prominent female footballer complaining of ""sexual abuse"" online.To raise awareness of the problem, the Melbourne Demons will hoist a banner emblazoned with negative tweets about players and teams at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before their Australian Football League match against Essendon Bombers.Players running through huge banners made by 'cheer squads' from crepe paper and sticky tape has been an Australian Rules tradition for over 70 years, although most showcase motivational messages or key milestones for players. The Demons players running through the banner on Friday would ""highlight how online harassment is a major issue not just for AFL players but for the one in five young Australians who are victims of cyber-bullying"", the team said.The Demons teamed up with ""Reach"", a youth-focused charity set up by the late former Melbourne player and president Jim Stynes, on the initiative.In a promotional video on the Demons' website (melbournefc.com.au), Melbourne's Aboriginal defender Neville Jetta holds up a placard with a tweet describing him as a ""scum bag"".Jetta said he had been deeply affected by racist online abuse, particularly early in his career.""In my early days I probably wasn't strong enough to call it out and they were the ones that I just deleted,"" the 29-year-old told an AFL chat show on local broadcaster Fox Sports.""It's not just racism, it's actually bullying, bullying people, and AFL players have that stance where we're able to speak out to the community and people actually listen to us.""Last week, Melbourne-based AFL club Richmond Tigers handed a two-year ban to a supporter who made racially abusive comments about West Coast Eagles forward Liam Ryan.Ryan, a 22-year-old Aboriginal, was called a ""monkey"" by multiple social media users on a local broadcaster's Instagram account.The sanction came days after AFL Women's player Tayla Harris complained of ""sexual abuse"" after a photograph of her kicking a goal triggered a raft of offensive comments on a broadcaster's social media account.

"Peggy Sue Gerron Rackham, who became part of Buddy Holly's circle of friends as a teenager and long reveled in having her name used as the title of one of his biggest hits, died on Monday in Lubbock, Tex. She was 78.Her son-in-law, Tom Stathos, confirmed the death but said he did not know the cause.As Ms. Rackham told the story, she was a sophomore at Lubbock High School in 1956 when she first encountered Mr. Holly, who had graduated a year earlier. She was walking to the school's band room — she played alto saxophone — and he was rushing to the auditorium to attend an assembly.He crashed into her, sending her to the floor, her books scattering and her poodle skirt rising over her knees.â€œI'm terribly sorry, but I don't have time to pick you up,â€ he said, as she recalled the moment in her autobiography, â€œWhatever Happened to Peggy Sue?â€ (2008). â€œBut you sure are pretty.â€He headed off. But she would get to know him better when she realized soon after that her boyfriend, Jerry Allison, was the drummer in Mr. Holly's band, which would become known as the Crickets.â€œAs a threesome, Jerry, Buddy and I spent most of our time together just hanging around at my house, listening to records or to Jerry arguing politics with my dad,â€ she wrote. She and Jerry went horseback riding, bowling and to the movies with Buddy and his girlfriend, Echo McGuire.Peggy Sue became â€œPeggy Sueâ€ a year later. The Crickets were in the producer Norman Petty's studio in Clovis, N.M., preparing to record â€œCindy Lou,â€ a song the group had been performing. (Its title was reportedly a combination of Mr. Holly's niece's first name and his sister's middle name.)But Mr. Allison was hoping to solidify his on-and-off relationship with Peggy Sue and asked Mr. Holly to change the song's name.â€œI think Buddy liked it because he knew me,â€ she told the website MusicDish e-Journal in 2004. And, she added, Mr. Allison â€œalways said, â€˜Peggy Sue rhymes with everything.' â€â€œPeggy Sueâ€ — â€œpretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sueâ€ — was released in 1957, shortly after Mr. Holly's â€œThat'll Be the Dayâ€ reached No. 1. And it was almost as successful, rising to No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Mr. Holly shared writing credit for â€œPeggy Sueâ€ with Mr. Allison and Mr. Petty (although the original label credited only Mr. Allison and Mr. Petty).Mr. Holly died in February 1959 in a plane crash in Iowa, along with his fellow singers Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper (J. P. Richardson). Ms. Rackham said she toured with the Crickets for a while after Mr. Holly's death, counting tickets at the gate among other jobs.She eloped with Mr. Allison in 1958; their marriage ended in the 1960s.Peggy Sue Gerron was born on June 15, 1940, in Olton, Tex. Her mother, Lillie (Rieger) Gerron, was a homemaker, and her father, John, was a civil engineer. Over time, she worked as a dental assistant and owned a plumbing business with her second husband, Lynn Rackham.Ms. Rackham's memoir, written with Glenda Cameron, was published shortly after â€œPeggy Sueâ€ turned 50. To recall her time around Mr. Holly and the Crickets, she said, she used about 150 contemporaneous diary entries.â€œI wanted to give him his voice,â€ she told The Guardian in 2008. â€œIt's my book, my memoirs. We were very, very good friends.â€Mr. Holly's widow, Maria Elena Holly, threatened to sue Ms. Rackham over what she said were false claims in the book.â€œHe never, never considered Peggy Sue a friend,â€ she told The Associated Press.Ultimately, Ms. Holly declined to sue because she thought the publicity would have helped Ms. Rackham sell books, her lawyer, Richard Wallace, said in an email.Ms. Rackham sustained her connection to â€œPeggy Sueâ€ in other ways over the years. She judged a Buddy Holly look-alike contest, helped promote the musical â€œBuddy: The Buddy Holly Storyâ€ in Australia and appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television program with the women behind other rock 'n' roll songs, like â€œAngie,â€ â€œBarbara Annâ€ and â€œDonna.â€She is survived by her daughter, Amanda Stathos; her son, Von Rackham; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her marriage to Mr. Rackham ended in divorce.A song as popular as â€œPeggy Sueâ€ ensured Ms. Rackham a dollop of everlasting fame.â€œIt's very hard to stand still,â€ she told the BBC in 2009, â€œwhen you're listening to â€˜Peggy Sue.' â€"
"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]As Petland Discounts opened stores across metropolitan New York, the pet store chain was propelled in no small part by a catchy commercial jingle that is now embedded in the region's collective consciousness.â€œPetland Discounts,â€ a nondescript chorus crooned over joyous synthesizer music. â€œFor the best care a pet can get.â€Later this year, that may no longer be the case.Last month, just days after the death of its longtime owner, Petland Discounts announced that it may have to close dozens of its stores and lay off workers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, according to notices filed with each state's Department of Labor.The company, which for decades has supplied pet owners with everything needed to keep their animal companions well fed, clean and happy, said in the documents that it would have to lay off more than 300 employees across more than 70 locations.Amy Eisenberg, Petland Discounts' director of public relations and special events, told The Brooklyn Daily Eagle that the company's closing was not certain. She said Petland Discounts filed the notices in case it needed to close amid the uncertainty caused by the death of its president and founder, Neil Padron.â€œNeil is the sole proprietor, and the family is still trying to figure everything out,â€ Ms. Eisenberg, who is Mr. Padron's daughter, said. Ms. Eisenberg declined to comment for this article.But Mayor Dwayne Warren of Orange, N.J., said in a statement on Wednesday that a national representative of Petland Discounts told him it would â€œpermanently close all company operations,â€ including the chain's outpost in his city, because of Mr. Padron's death.Staff and customers at Petland Discounts stores in Brooklyn on Friday acted as though the closings were all but certain. The fish tanks' bubbles were still roiling and the cockatiels kept chirping, but the people were glum.Tatiana Vazquez, the Park Slope store's manager, said she had known about her store's impending closure for about a week.She said Petland Discounts was struggling to compete with online retailers. Fish food priced $13 at her store, she said, could sell for $5 at the pet store site Chewy.com.Luis Garcia, 48, who has worked at the store in Sunset Park for the past three years, said that initially he was told that the chain could stay open if the owner's heirs found a buyer. He has since learned that the company will help him find another job, which he saw as a sign that the closure is final.Mr. Garcia added that he considers his workplace â€œa public zoo.â€Mr. Padron, who died Jan. 14 from bladder cancer, started his pet retail business in Queens in 1965. His first store was a tropical fish emporium that sold aquatic creatures, as well as the aquariums and supplies needed to maintain them.As Petland Discounts grew, it expanded its offerings. The chain stocked cat food and dog toys, but also hawked live birds and their cages, reptiles and terrariums, and small animals like hamsters and the wheels that kept them busy.Beyond supplying pets and pet products, Petland offered something for the animal-averse as well: its commercials. Punctuated by an innocuous yet mellifluous jingle, the advertisements left an indelible impression on countless New Yorkers who watched local television in the 1980s and 1990s.Adam Moss, 27, who grew up in Highland Park, N.J., remembered seeing the company's commercials â€œeverywhere and every day.â€ When he heard the company might close, he went back to listen to old commercials he had saved and others he found on YouTube.â€œI lived in the area so long they've become iconic to me,â€ Mr. Moss said. â€œIt was so disappointing. I cried for a while after relistening to some of them.â€Mr. Padron showed up often in the commercials. With his strong New York accent and bushy mustache, he stood out on local channels as he walked through the aisles of Petland Discounts stores, promising anything a pet lover could need at a reasonable cost.At the company's peak, Petland Discounts ran 118 locations across three states. As of this week, it operated 78, Ms. Eisenberg told Newsday.Petland Discounts said in the notices it filed that it would close all of its New Jersey and Connecticut stores by March 19 and its New York locations one month later.Steven Hernandez, 17, said the closure of the store in Sunset Park would complicate his procurement of live crickets for his two pet bearded dragons.If he shops online, he will be forced to buy in bulk, he said, and his apartment cannot accommodate so many crickets.â€œThis will make it a lot harder,â€ Mr. Hernandez said. â€œA lot.â€"

"LONDON — Reza Rashidian could give Dos Equis' famous and fictional â€œmost interesting man in the worldâ€ a run for his money.Mr. Rashidian has been a racecar driver, big game hunter, movie producer, real estate magnate, bon vivant, aspiring poet and artist, and noted collector — of cars, 19th-century animal sculptures, and watches.It took him more than 20 years of dedicated hunting to amass what he called â€œthe ultimateâ€ dive watch collection, featuring what several industry experts have called one of the rarest watches in existence: Rolex's Deepsea Special Number One. (The collection recently was detailed in the book â€œA Journey Into the Deepâ€ by John Goldberger and Daniel Bourn.)As Mr. Rashidian is considered a friend of Phillips auction house, and its London office on Berkeley Square was a convenient place to take a look at some of his scores of watches, we met on a recent springlike afternoon. And Mr. Rashidian explained why, after years of collecting all manner of watches, he decided to focus on Rolex stainless steel dive watches. â€œThese watches went to the greatest depths on earth,â€ he said, with divers risking their lives and equipment. The watches â€œare firmly a part of the human condition.â€The collector witnessed another side of the human condition firsthand as a young boy growing up in Tehran. In 1978 his father, who was in banking and real estate, sensed unrest and moved the family to a home they had in London, â€œjust for the summer,â€ Mr. Rashidian said. But the Shah of Iran was deposed in January 1979 and the family — its banks confiscated and some of its friends killed — never left England. Mr. Rashidian, now 52, lived in London most of his life before moving to Switzerland three years ago, trading the city for the mountains.Nature was an important part of the collector's early years, too. When he was 5 he started hunting with his uncle. â€œIt wasn't about killing,â€ he said, but being outdoors and â€œexperiencing nature in the rain, the snow, in all its guises.â€ His shoots might have taken him to Ethiopia or Tajikistan for weeks at a time, sleeping in tents or shacks. â€œYou have to love the outdoors,â€ he said.Hunting led him to create the cultishly popular Pro Hunter watch in 2006 after Rolex refused to customize one of its watches with a black case and glass (to eliminate reflection), fixed lugs and a NATO strap (to replace a bracelet that, Mr. Rashidian said, â€œyou can't crawl with, it digs in.â€) So he developed his own timepiece.Soon others wanted one, and owners now include President Bill Clinton; Antoine Arnault of LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton; FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault of Kering; Prince Pavlos of Greece; and Mr. Rashidian's friends Tim Jeffries, owner of Hamiltons gallery in London, and the actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers.Mr. Rashidian now is no longer involved in the business. And he no longer hunts. Not for big game, anyway, but he said he used some of the same strategies when collecting. A hunt starts with research, which â€œinterests me more than the ownership,â€ he said, a testament to his years studying history at London and Oxford universities. Another of the joys: â€œWhen you collect you find people with similar enthusiasm, and you share it,â€ at dinners and events where he meets other watch fans.His love of watches began early: His father, who died when Mr. Rashidian was 13, gave him his first watch. Mr. Rashidian opened a case and displayed a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust, with a strap now too small to circle his wrist. â€œThis put the thought in my head. This is where it started,â€ he said.Next, his mother gave him a gold Rolex Day-Date Oysterquartz for his 18th birthday, and soon after Mr. Rashidian made his own first purchase, a Rolex stainless steel GMT Master. (He raised the sleeve of his Hackett suit jacket to show that he still wears it.)In his 20s, when he started collecting watches, he bought some contemporary models like Patek Philippes, Audemars Piguets and Breguets. And Rolexes, which he said he preferred to wear because they stood up to constant use and were â€œmore approachable, and stainless steel is much more approachable.â€ He still has some of these early purchases in his collection.The more he learned about watches — especially about their histories, he said — the more he gravitated toward vintage ones. And few watches can rival the story of the Rolex Deep Sea Special Number One: In 1953, the watch, which has a signature bubble-shaped crystal, was strapped to the outside of the Trieste bathyscaph before the research vessel went two miles deep in the waters off Italy's Ponza Island, withstanding pressure of 8,820 pounds per square inch.The bathyscaph and the watch later went down even farther, to nearly 2.3 miles deep. As a result, Rolex marketing began making the brand's claim to dive watch supremacy and, by extension, sports watch dominance.Mr. Rashidian had brought the Deepsea Special Number One with him, and carefully removed the timepiece from its special case to display its unusual 35-millimeter thickness and distinctive domed crystal. He placed it on the table with the other watches he had brought. â€œThere,â€ he said in a â€œta-daâ€ moment, â€œis the most famous Rolex dive watch in the world sitting next to the dinky one I got as a boy.â€Mr. Rashidian recently sold two of his 36 dive watches featured in the book at a Phillips auction in Geneva: a Rolex Single Red Sea-Dweller, which once belonged to the celebrated diver Robert Palmer Bradley, and a Rolex Sea-Dweller made for the Sultan of Oman, with his name, Qaboos, in Arabic on the dial.He put those two up for sale because, after having amassed and documented what he considers the ultimate dive watch collection, he now is contemplating starting on something new and is deep into research.He won't say what his next focus will be, (â€œdon't reveal your handâ€ is one of his strategies) but it will be something special, as he said collectors should â€œbuy something unique or rare that has intrinsic or personal value.â€â€œI need to find new areas that excite me,â€ he said, and admitted that patience is not his strong suit, and apparently never has been.When he was a student at the British public school Haileybury, he was captain of the rugby team and looked down his nose at cricket. â€œI didn't have the patience to play that game. It seems like nothing happens for a very long time, and then suddenly people start to clap. It's not in my personality. I'm less cricket, more rugby.â€ And ready to score his next great collection."
"LOS ANGELES — â€œWe got a plane!â€Sitcom showrunners have no shortage of logistical worries, but air traffic isn't generally among them. That is, unless you happen to be shooting your sitcom in a backyard beside the Burbank airport.And so it was that Josh Malmuth, the creator of the new sitcom â€œAbby's,â€ stared at the sky one night last fall as his production ground to a halt, girding himself for another shoot to be interrupted every 15 minutes or so by an assistant producer with word of a plane, or a helicopter, or perhaps a drone.â€œAnd so it begins,â€ he muttered.Such are the wages of innovation. â€œAbby's,â€ which debuts March 28 on NBC, is a 10-episode multicamera sitcom that is shot almost entirely outside, a simple-sounding tweak that nevertheless turns one of the hoariest of television conventions into something that, as far as anyone can tell, has never really been done before.Natalie Morales (â€œParks and Recreation,â€ â€œWhite Collarâ€) stars as Abby, an ex-Marine who turns her backyard into a neighborhood watering hole, where an array of quirky regulars, including Neil Flynn (â€œThe Middleâ€), Nelson Franklin (â€œVeepâ€) and Jessica Chaffin (â€œSearch Partyâ€), pass their evenings and tee up one another's punch lines.It's the same basic setup that has undergirded any number of workplace shows and other comedies based on improvised families. This includes perhaps the greatest of all sitcoms, â€œCheers,â€ which also happens to be the series against which all other bar comedies will be measured.â€œThe â€˜Cheers' comparisons have been what everybody talks about, and listen, we'll take it,â€ Morales said. â€œThat being said, there have been a lot of medical shows, a lot of law shows, and people hang out in bars a lot. So we were like, â€˜I think it's fine to do another bar show.'â€The concept was inspired by Bacchanal, a New Orleans wine bar that consists largely of a graceful courtyard (and which figured in a rainy subplot in â€œTremeâ€). Malmuth, a San Diego native, moved the concept to his hometown and convinced Michael Schur, one of the most prolific sitcom makers in show business these days, to help him develop it.At first glance, Schur would seem to be an unlikely choice for a multicamera sitcom, the classic form — generally consisting of actors performing on a contained set before multiple cameras and a studio audience — that defined TV comedy for decades, from â€œI Love Lucyâ€ to â€œAll In the Familyâ€ to â€œThe Cosby Showâ€ to â€œSeinfeldâ€ and â€œFriends.â€Schur's tightly serialized, philosophically inquisitive â€œThe Good Placeâ€ is widely acclaimed for its narrative ambition, and the earlier filmic, single-camera shows he worked on, like â€œThe Officeâ€ and â€œParks and Recreation,â€ were instrumental in creating the perception that the multicamera format, with its stagy setups and broadly telegraphed jokes, was a relic of a simpler TV era. Even CBS's soon-to-depart â€œBig Bang Theory,â€ TV's top-rated show for much of the past decade and the longest-running multicamera sitcom in history, went single-cam for its spinoff, â€œYoung Sheldon.â€But Schur was intrigued by the idea, so he and Malmuth hopped in a golf cart and drove around the Universal lot in search of an ideal spot. They found it on the former Wisteria Lane, where the stars of â€œDesperate Housewivesâ€ once backstabbed (and front-stabbed, and actually stabbed) their way to ratings gold.After NBC gave the go-ahead, an outdoor studio was built behind the house that once belonged to Edie (the desperate housewife played by Nicollette Sheridan). The goal was to split the difference between a conventional set — with water- and windproof lighting rigs and a smooth, level concrete slab for easy camera movement — and a backyard, with strung lights, fire pits and largely unobstructed natural elements.â€œThere's an episode when you see Jessica's hair blowing a little more than it probably would, but that's part of being outside,â€ said Franco Bario, the co-executive producer who oversaw construction of the set. â€œThe more it looks like a stage, the less important it is that we're out here.â€The set includes bleachers for the just over 100 people who provide what amounts to an outdoor laugh track — each episode opens by noting, in a nod to sitcom intros of yore, that â€œâ€˜Abby's' was filmed before a live outdoor audience.â€ To reinforce the notion, the cameras will occasionally pull back before and after commercial breaks to show the crowd and set.â€œYou see the audience; you see that we're, like, literally on the side of a cliff in Universal Studios; you see the Los Angeles city lights; and then you see us on this weird little outdoor set, acting,â€ Morales said later. â€œIt's going to feel familiar, but it's also going to feel very novel.â€Schur said, â€œWe worried a little about breaking the fourth wall, but the very premise of a multicam is constantly breaking the fourth wall — you're hearing humans laughing.â€Though they have plenty of well-regarded sitcoms between them — Malmuth was a writer and producer for â€œNew Girlâ€ and â€œSuperstoreâ€ — the theatrical setting harkens back to earlier in their careers, when Malmuth wrote for the stage and Schur for â€œSaturday Night Live.â€But they weren't necessarily looking to reinvent an old format, they said in a joint interview shortly before the shoot, in another house up Wisteria Lane.â€œThe objective wasn't, let's set out to rejuvenate the medium,â€ Schur said. â€œThe objective was let's execute this idea as well as we can, and then this is how we're backing into that.â€â€œWe don't want to do it on a stage with AstroTurf, so what can we do?â€ Malmuth said.That said, there is a replica of the bar set on a nearby soundstage to use for rehearsals and as a weather contingency plan. (â€œAbby'sâ€ made it through its first season without a rainout.)But other things, like the menagerie of critters in the surrounding hills, you just have to deal with.The night I was there, a raccoon got into the craft services tent — â€œThat's a first,â€ Malmuth said when I told him — and skunks have been known to wander onto the set. Crickets are also an issue, though sound editors have to add them as often as subtract, for continuity's sake. During one break in the filming, a baby gopher scampered down the driveway and blindly caromed off several people's shoes before weaving its way back into the bushes.â€œOccasionally packs of wild coyotes come out of the hills and just maul an actor,â€ Schur said. (He was joking.)The odd mauling aside, a general feeling of festivity prevails on the set, with the crowd, crickets and flickering fires coalescing into something more akin to a summer-camp talent show than a network sitcom.During yet another chopper break, music thumped as a jovial M.C. whipped up the audience, who munched boxed dinners and huddled in blankets in the crisp (for Los Angeles) November night.â€œApparently these planes and helicopters don't care that we're trying to make a TV show!â€ the M.C. said, and then pointed out Schur, eating onion rings by one of the cameras, who waved at the crowd. Leonard Ouzts, who plays one of the regulars, mingled with extras as production assistants lugged an enormous tuna onto the set for a scene involving an elaborate fish tale.â€œThere are a bunch of jokes about how we're going to have to shoo cats away and it's going to start to stink, and those might just be prophetic,â€ Schur said. â€œIf coyotes are ever actually going to come out of the hills, it's going to happen tonight. So buckle up.â€"
"SYDNEY, Australia — India's president, Ram Nath Kovind, on Friday began wrapping up his visit to Australia after several days of meetings as the two countries move to tighten their economic and political bonds at a time of worsening tensions between China and the United States.The visit came four months after the quiet release of a 500-page report by Australia's former top diplomat, Peter Varghese, on the need to enhance the country's economic and security ties with India over the coming years.Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, endorsed that report on Thursday, calling it â€œa road map for our economic future with India.â€ He and other officials said the Australian government had agreed to work on strengthening ties between the two countries' education, resources, agribusiness and tourism sectors.â€œThe relationship is on an upward trajectory and this visit is likely to give it positive momentum,â€ said Ajay Gondane, India's high commissioner to Australia.Although the leaders' conversation focused on economic partnerships, their meeting and the Varghese report have pointed to growing concerns in both countries about China's aggressive rise, experts said, and the efforts needed to counter it.â€œThe report did not specifically say that India and Australia need to work together to balance China — it was much more sophisticated and nuanced,â€ said Amitabh Mattoo, a professor at the University of Melbourne and the founding director of the university's Australia India Institute. â€œBut anyone who reads between the lines would recognize that it's China, China and China.â€Mr. Morrison emphasized shared values between Australia and India, drawing an implicit contrast with China's authoritarian approach.â€œOur cultures might be different, but we believe in similar things — we believe in the supremacy of the ballot box in our national life; in the rule of law,â€ Mr. Morrison said at the India Business Summit in Sydney on Thursday. â€œAnd we believe in the rights of nations to live free and not under the controlling hand of others.â€President Kovind echoed that point, speaking of â€œthe peace and prosperity of a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific Region,â€ as well as â€œa shared passion for cricket.â€After unveiling a statue of Mohandas K. Gandhi and addressing members of the Indian diaspora in Sydney, Mr. Kovind spoke to students at the University of Melbourne before heading to a cricket game between India and Australia.The visit came as the two countries have become increasingly interwoven through trade and immigration.Two-way trade between Australia and India hit $27.5 billion last year; 700,000 people of Indian descent call Australia home, making it the fastest growing immigrant community in Australia; and more than 87,000 Indian students are enrolled at Australian educational institutions, Mr. Morrison said in his speech Thursday. He added that â€œwe welcome more skilled migrants from India than any other nation.â€India has also been a major investor in Australia's mining industry. Mr. Morrison said that coal was Australia's largest export to India, worth more than $9 billion in 2017.But one of those investments has drawn intense scrutiny: the effort by the Indian company Adani to open one of the world's largest coal mines, which opponents say would harm the Great Barrier Reef because of potential damage from coal shipments. The plan still awaits final approval.But this week, the focus has been on strengthening economic ties and broadening the two countries' strategic alignment.The talks came a year and a half after Malcolm Turnbull, Mr. Morrison's predecessor, met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on a visit to India. At the time, Mr. Turnbull put a proposed free-trade agreement between the countries on the back burner. Now there is a greater sense of urgency to build ties in order to counter China, Professor Mattoo said.â€œThe economic relationship will happen in any case,â€ he said. â€œIt is the strategic alignment that is important to ensure that the relationship really takes off.â€"
"The Canadian government said on Wednesday that it would withdraw up to half of its diplomatic staff in Havana, as it disclosed that another employee had fallen ill with the mysterious symptoms that have affected dozens of Americans and Canadians stationed in Cuba.Since early 2017, American and Canadian government employees in Cuba have suffered strange symptoms such as dizziness, insomnia, hearing loss and nausea when using a computer. Canada's government said that, in all, 14 Canadian employees, spouses and dependents have been affected.Global Affairs Canada, the nation's foreign ministry, said that after the last confirmed case of unusual symptoms, in November 2018, Canadian staff members in Havana undertook additional medical testing. Those tests confirmed â€œan additional employee has symptoms consistent with those of previously affected employees,â€ the ministry's statement said.Though the Canadian government had started â€œrevised security measures,â€ it said, â€œwe have decided to reduce by up to half the number of Canadian staff posted to Havana.â€The Canadian Embassy will continue to function with consular services and an ambassador, the ministry said, but some programs may be affected. It did not respond to questions about current or future staffing numbers.There was no evidence that Canadian travelers are at risk, the ministry said.So far, 26 Americans have been affected with similar maladies, according to the State Department, and doctors who examined some of the Americans said they had suffered inner-ear damage.But neither the United States nor Canada has determined a cause for the symptoms, leading to speculation that some kind of microwave weapon may have been deployed against the diplomats, who have described hearing a strange, high-pitched sound, often accompanied by a sensation of intense pressure.Two scientists have also suggested that a species of loud, droning cricket may have been responsible for the noise, although its sounds are rapid-fire pulses while the diplomats described an erratic sound.The United States has also withdrawn personnel from its embassy in Havana, reducing its operations to a bare-bones staff of about two dozen. And in October 2017 the Trump administration expelled over a dozen Cuban diplomats over the illnesses, after issuing a warning to Americans not to travel to the island.Cuba has denied any responsibility for the illnesses, and condemned the expulsions of diplomats as a â€œhasty, inappropriate and unthinkingâ€ decision that was motivated by politics.While the Trump administration said those expulsions did not signal a change in policy toward Cuba, it has taken a more hostile stance to Havana than the Obama administration, which began normalizing relations with the old Cold War foe."
"Adolescence is hard enough, but how are you supposed to handle trauma in the family when your parents are overwhelmed, absent, overbearing or just plain oblivious? Anger and grief have a way of hijacking your mind and heart, so when you can't get through to parents, you do what the tweens in these middle-grade novels do: Find a distinctive way of dealing with it, and learn that grown-up thing of putting on a good face even if you're crumbling inside.In Lindsey Stoddard's RIGHT AS RAIN (Harper, 304 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), the traumatic event is the sudden death of Rain's teenage brother, Guthrie. At their relentlessly optimistic mother's behest, they move from Vermont to New York City, while their father slips into depression. They arrive in Washington Heights dazed, a non-Spanish-speaking white family in a Latino neighborhood, and over the next two weeks — the time of the novel — a lot happens: Rain enrolls in a new middle school, joins the track team, qualifies for the city championship, enlists her stuporous father in building a community garden, and hopes that her parents will be the â€œone in fourâ€ couples that survives the death of a child.Stoddard has a knack for writing strong, feisty protagonists, like the heroine in her first book, â€œJust Like Jackie.â€ Although Rain is wounded by her brother's death and anxious about her parents' arguments, she is a self-assured problem solver. She has a thing for numbers: She counts — bricks, miles, minutes, anything — to â€œempty her brainâ€ and finds solace in running. Stoddard's exploration of grief's grip on a family rings true and tender; she does a remarkable job of conveying the emotional haze Rain's outward confidence hides. Lovely, dreamy chapters (each entitled â€œThat Nightâ€) flicker through the novel, chronicling Guthrie's final hours and revealing the guilt Rain feels over his death. There, we see Rain at her vulnerable best: saving herself, if not her parents' marriage.Carter Jones's parents' marriage will not survive the death of a child — that we know early on. In Gary D. Schmidt's PAY ATTENTION, CARTER JONES (Clarion, 224 pp., $16.99; ages 10 to 12), 12-year-old Carter's heartbroken family is propped up by an endearing visitor: an English butler who worked with their grandfather. The dapper, cultivated Mr. Bowles-Fitzpatrick attends to Carter, his three younger sisters and a vomiting dachshund, while their mother sorts out the death of 6-year-old Currier and the absence of her soldier husband.Carter is a good, compassionate kid, but he's torn up inside and steamed by his father's lack of communication. Schmidt seamlessly fuses humor and tragedy here, as he did in his Newbery Honor book â€œThe Wednesday Wars.â€ The butler can be a â€œpain in the gluteâ€ and a â€œblabber,â€ Carter tells us, while Mr. Bowles-Fitzpatrick gently chides that you should never â€œbegin your sentence with a subordinating conjunction,â€ like â€œbecause.â€ The repartee takes the edge off the loneliness Carter feels: â€œWhen you carry stuff like this around, you never know what kind of day it's going to be.â€It's striking that Schmidt chose cricket to put a spin on the boy-as-athlete motif. During a crucial match Carter's grief spills over. He has flashbacks of his most recent encounter with his father, on a camping trip after Currier died. The place had poisonous snakes, crocodiles and screeching birds, and Carter confronted his father for being absent when Currier was ill. Now, as the lengthy cricket match proceeds, he hears people in the crowd telling him to â€œpay attention,â€ which is precisely what his father was unable to do. One suspects that Carter, as he grows, will be more attentive to those emotions. He already is.There's no overt trauma in Aida Salazar's debut novel, THE MOON WITHIN (Scholastic, 240 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), but the circumstances leading up to a Mexican-Puerto Rican black girl's initiation into womanhood include anger and an overbearing mother. Celi is seething at her Mima for insisting on a â€œmoon ceremony,â€ an indigenous coming-of-age ritual to celebrate a first period. Lately, Celi's â€œflorâ€ (as her mother calls it) tingles when she's around IvÃ¡n, whom she knows from a cultural center in Oakland. So when Mima overshares by telling IvÃ¡n what a moon ceremony is, Celi stands by feeling â€œlike someone is stepping / on my chest / my breath stolen away.â€ Meanwhile, Celi's best friend, Magda, is entering puberty a different way, taking the name Marco and identifying as male. The gender transition seems smooth enough — until IvÃ¡n insults Marco and Celi laughs. Ashamed at putting her crush before her best friend, she stows it in her â€œheart locketâ€ — the imaginary place she puts her deepest feelings.Salazar tells the story in free verse, which works well to convey Celi's emotions, giving them a powerful, beautiful charge (â€œMima leaves me to cry / sitting in a soup / of hummingbird herbs and rageâ€), and less well for dialogue (â€œWhat you doing next week, Celi? / IvÃ¡n asks suddenly. / You wanna go to the skate park?â€). Although the novel has been compared to Judy Blume's â€œAre You There, God? It's Me, Margaret,â€ an instant classic in 1970 for its frank expression of how girls feel about their changing bodies, Salazar's book, half a century on, is less saucy: Where Blume's girls exuberantly chanted â€œWe must! We must! We must increase our bust!,â€ Celi wilts with embarrassment when Mima calls her father to celebrate that â€œour girl is growing breasts!â€Salazar's take on menstruation is contemporary and important, however: It presents families of mixed-race heritage embracing ancestral traditions (Celi eventually does), accepting gender fluidity and acting generally body-positive. Marco, raised Magdalena, has a ceremony as well: one to celebrate his â€œOmeteotl energy / a person who inhabits two beings / the female and the male at once.â€ For all that, Marco is still biologically female. Had he also gotten his first period, Salazar might have truly explored uncharted emotional terrain.Sam Abernathy first appeared as a high school freshman in â€œStand-Off,â€ the second novel in Andrew Smith's Y.A. series â€œWinger.â€ So THE SIZE OF THE TRUTH (Simon & Schuster, 272 pp., $17.99; ages 8 to 12) is a prequel of sorts. As a 4-year-old in Blue Creek, Tex., Sam spent three days trapped at the bottom of a well, and the murky memory now shows up in his claustrophobia and his fear of the â€œmurdererâ€ James Jenkins, an eighth-grade boy he thinks pushed him into the well all those years ago. Now 11, Sam skips from sixth to eighth grade, where he struggles with being smaller than his classmates. He harbors a secret desire to be a chef, while his father wants him to go to M.I.T. and become a scientist.Smith's narration alternates between sections called â€œEighth Gradeâ€ and hallucinatory sections rendering Sam's three days in the well, spent with a snarky armadillo (this is Texas) named Bartleby. Bartleby is a Yoda figure (â€œDon't go living your life only trying to avoid holesâ€), and there's a fantastical cantina-style scene, too: a choir of bats singing gospel music, a coyote waitress, Spanish-speaking otters and the coffin of a bank robber from 1888. The zany, philosophical conversation between Sam and Bartleby is sophisticated for a tween (yes, the armadillo utters his namesake's famous line), but it's thoroughly enjoyable: I happily would have read a book just about the two of them.Smith's delightful evocation of the weird and his ongoing exploration of masculinity show up in this novel, too. Sam's father, a kilt-wearing proprietor of a miniature golf course, takes him on survivalist camping trips. James Jenkins turns out to have a surprising passion other than football. He and Sam both have to face their fathers, and stand up for their less traditional choices.The truth, here as in all these engaging middle-grade novels, turns out to be large and complicated, made more so by growing up with loss and the heightened reality it brings. With ample reasons to succumb to grief or unhappiness, these undaunted tweens prefer not to."
"On Feb. 14, a 19-year-old drove a vehicle filled with explosives into a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces in Indian-administered Kashmir and killed 49 soldiers. Jaish-e-Muhammad, or the Army of Muhammad, a Pakistan-based terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.Over the past five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has governed India and been part of the local government in Kashmir as well, thus controlling India's policy approaches to the disputed, conflict-torn region. Mr. Modi embraced a militaristic approach and shunned a political process involving dialogue with the separatists in Kashmir. Consequently, the number of civilian and security personnel killed in the region have increased, and a growing number of young Kashmiris, like Adil Dar, the 19-year-old suicide bomber, joined militant groups.These are inconvenient facts for Mr. Modi, who has continually attacked India's opposition parties for being soft on terror and compromising national security. As the deaths of the soldiers come three months before a general election, an honest evaluation of Mr. Modi's failed policy should have led to him to being held accountable.Such questions, naturally, receded into the background in the immediate aftermath of the Kashmir bombing, in a national outpouring of grief. Before those pertinent questions would return to the national conversation, Mr. Modi spun the bad news to his advantage by turning the grief into an emotive and prolonged commemoration of the deaths of the soldiers.As Indian television networks followed the coffins of the slain troops draped in the Indian flag on their final journey home, Mr. Modi's party directed its senior leaders to attend the cremations, which were telecast live. The funerals became occasions for patriotic avowals, some genuine, some orchestrated, as politicians sought to ensure they were part of the frame.Mr. Modi ratcheted up the rhetoric against Pakistan and suggested that India would retaliate militarily. â€œSecurity forces have been given complete freedom, the blood of the people is boiling,â€ he said. On social media and television networks, retired military generals, such as G.D. Bakshi, echoed Mr. Modi's words and described the bombing in Kashmir as an act of war. â€œThey started it but we will finish it,â€ he said.The venerable Cricket Club of India, a colonial institution founded in 1933, decided to do its part by draping a portrait of Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan, which had been put up to honor his cricketing feats in the last century. The mourning took on a more sinister note as gangs of young men started parading the streets of many Indian cities, including New Delhi, shouting slogans directed at Pakistan and â€œanti-nationalsâ€ — the preferred term of the Hindu nationalists for perceived foes and undesirables ranging from liberals to Muslims.Several Hindu nationalist affiliates of Mr. Modi's party led a campaign that targeted students from Kashmir studying in educational institutions across India. They managed to extract promises from a few colleges that they would not admit Kashmiri students. The tone and tenor of the marches and the threats to Kashmiri students were not lost even on Mr. Modi's own allies. In an editorial in its party newspaper, Shiv Sena, the Mumbai-based Hindu nationalist party, cautioned the prime minister that â€œthere were political allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could wage a small-scale war to win elections â€¦. The rulers should not behave in a manner that these allegations gain credence.â€Mr. Modi's political use of the deaths of â€œmartyrsâ€ is not new to India, but we haven't seen it at such a scale since India and Pakistan fought a limited war over Kashmir in 1999. In the past two decades, Indian security forces have periodically been targets of violent insurgent attacks, some causing even larger numbers of casualties, but the grief has run its normal course.Mr. Modi and his party seem to be working on a template of exploiting calamitous deaths that they have used before. In February 2002, soon after he took over as chief minister of the western Indian state of Gujarat, a train carrying Hindu religious volunteers was allegedly set on fire in the town of Godhra by a group of Muslims. Fifty-nine people died. Mr. Modi ensured the bodies of the dead were taken to the Ahmedabad, the largest city in the state, and paraded through the city. Violence broke out soon after. Hindu mobs fueled by incendiary rhetoric from leaders of organizations affiliated with the Bharatiya Janata Party, targeted homes and businesses owned by Muslims. Over a thousand people were killed, over 700 of them Muslims.In his campaign for the state elections held a few months after the violence, Mr. Modi barely disguised his hatred and contempt for the Muslim minority, describing them as a demographic threat to India and seeking to connect them with Pakistan. The insurgency in Kashmir, which is the only Muslim majority state in the country, is often invoked in the same fashion by Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist party.Mr. Modi is at his political best with an electoral campaign run on sectarian and polarizing themes. Before the attack in Kashmir, he was facing an opposition campaign dominated by questions about unemployment being the highest in 45 years and distress in Indian villages. His party had already lost state elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, partly as a result of an acute farm crisis in India.This was the campaign that the Congress Party and other opposition parties were looking to fight; this is the campaign that Mr. Modi is seeking to avoid with the emotive call of martyrdom. Ironically, a vast majority of the soldiers who died were drawn from India's lower and middle castes with largely rural backgrounds, a far cry from the upper-caste, urban Hindu voters who are Mr. Modi's most ardent and hawkish supporters.What has largely gone unspoken in the aftermath of the Kashmir attack is that the C.R.P.F., the paramilitary force these young men joined, is heavily understaffed and underequipped, a stark contrast to Mr. Modi's bluster on national security.In 1999, I was working as a reporter in the northern state of Punjab. I covered the cremations of soldiers who had died in Kargil in the war between India and Pakistan. Each body draped in the Indian flag was accompanied by a soldier from the fallen man's unit. Those men were angry with the government and willing to speak on record with their names and ranks about being been sent to battle in the icy Himalayan mountains without proper equipment to shield them from the cold and the snow. When I wrote their stories, my editors refused to publish them and argued that it was not the time to report such things because they were damaging to the â€œnational interest.â€In the rhetoric of martyrdom that prevails in Mr. Modi's India, editors across the country are making similar calls and leaving out inconvenient facts and questions. It may or may not be in the national interest, but it certainly is in Mr. Modi's interest."
"LONDON — When Alfred Smith and Bob Weighton were born, Edward VII was king of Britain. They have lived through two world wars, more than 20 prime ministers and the entire rule of Britain's longest-reigning monarch. They also saw Britain join the predecessor of the European Union — a bloc it was supposed to leave on Friday, the day both men turned 111.As it became clear that the withdrawal known as Brexit wouldn't happen on his birthday after all, Mr. Weighton, who lives in southern England, echoed a growing frustration with the current political deadlock, calling it â€œa total mess.â€â€œMy own feeling is that if there were defects — and there were quite obviously defects — we can negotiate on the inside rather than walking off the field with the cricket ball and saying â€˜I'm not playing,'â€ Mr. Weighton told the BBC.But the most common question he has been asked does not concern politics. He said most people wanted to know the secret to his longevity — something to which he could not respond.â€œI have no answer, except to avoid dying,â€ he said.The oldest person on record living in Britain is a woman: Grace Jones turned 112 in September. But men are increasingly living past the age of 90, and more than 14,000 centenarians were living in Britain in 2017, the most recent year such statistics are available, according to the Office for National Statistics.Government population estimates see the number of centenarians passing 65,000 by 2031.Most British citizens receive a personal greeting from Queen Elizabeth II on their 100th and 105th birthdays, and one for each year past the age of 110. Mr. Weighton told the BBC that he would ask the monarch to stop sending him cards in order to save public funds.Mr. Weighton and Mr. Smith, who lives in Scotland, were both born on March 29, 1908. In recent years, their photographs have appeared in the news side by side, sitting in armchairs 500 miles apart. Though they have never met in person, the two men have exchanged birthday cards.â€œI feel he's a twin brother, although technically he's not,â€ Mr. Smith said of Mr. Weighton in an interview last year with the Scottish network STV.Both men have led an adventurous life spanning continents and different jobs. In the 1930s, Mr. Weighton taught at a missionary school in Taiwan, and moved to the United States by way of Canada.He and his wife, Agnes, were in the United States during the attack on Pearl Harbor that drew the country into World War II. He has a son who married a Swede and a daughter who married a German.â€œI flatly refuse to regard my grandchildren as foreigners,â€ he told The Guardian last year. â€œI'm an internationalist, but I've not lost my pride in being a Yorkshireman or British.â€Mr. Smith immigrated to Canada in 1927 and worked on a farm there. But he returned to Scotland after five years to drive trucks for his brother. He was a farmer until his retirement at the age of 70.â€œI like to think I've lived a decent life,â€ he told The Scotsman newspaper this past week. â€œI do ask myself — why me? Why have I lived so long when others haven't?â€ he asked. His wife died more than 15 years ago at 97, and one of his sons died in 2016.As to longevity, Mr. Smith had no definitive answer, either.â€œPorridge is helpful,â€ he said, â€œand having a job you enjoy.â€"
"Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for March, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.â€˜Eighth Grade'Starts streaming: March 1The ordeals of adolescent girlhood have been chronicled many times on screen, but not since Todd Solondz's â€œWelcome to the Dollhouseâ€ have they been as acutely registered as they are in Bo Burnham's directorial debut. â€œEighth Gradeâ€ doesn't share the sourness of Solondz's film, however, empathizing strongly with Kayla (Elsie Fisher) as she posts would-be viral videos, throws herself into awkward social situations and rolls her eyes at her overly attentive single father (Josh Hamilton), who doesn't know how to help her. Burnham is particularly smart about integrating social media and messaging into Kayla's story, and showing the ways they reinforce her isolation and desire to connect.â€˜La La Land'Starts streaming: March 1In the aftermath of its false Best Picture win against â€œMoonlight,â€ it's been easy to forget how much momentum and good will Damien Chazelle's throwback musical carried into Oscar night and how big a shock it was that it lost. But one of the benefits of â€œLa La Landâ€ not winning Best Picture is that it's no longer freighted by the â€œimportanceâ€ that goes along with the title. Chazelle's musical pastiche about the Hollywood romance between an actress (Emma Stone) and a jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) was always meant to be a light evocation of Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers vehicles, coupled with the bittersweet quality of â€œThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg,â€ and it's now free to be enjoyed on those terms.â€˜The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind'Starts streaming: March 1The superb character actor Chiwetel Ejiofor makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of the best-selling memoir about a Malawian teenager who takes it upon himself to save his impoverished village. Maxwell Simba stars as William Kamkwamba, a boy who loses his education when his family can no longer afford to send him to school, but who become an autodidact to bring electricity and water to his drought-ravaged area. Using scrap materials and science textbooks, he attempts to construct his own wind turbine. Ejiofor gives himself a key supporting role as Kamkwamba's father, who greets his son's initiative with a mix of pride and practical concern.â€˜Juanita'Starts streaming: March 8Alfre Woodard has been acting in movies and on television for 40 years, and she's as vibrant and appealing as ever in â€œJuanita,â€ a late-in-life road movie/romance that has been constructed around the title character's range and adventurousness. Adapted from Sheila Williams's novel â€œDancing on the Edge of the Roof,â€ the film stars Woodard as a middle-aged woman who follows a one-way Greyhound bus ticket from the Columbus, Ohio, projects to Montana, where she turns around a struggling diner and finds refuge (and love). But on a journey intended to liberate her, she worries about being tied down someplace else.â€˜Triple Frontier'Starts streaming: March 13Netflix's most prominent — and promising — film release in March brings together J.C. Chandor, the superb director of â€œAll Is Lostâ€ and â€œA Most Violent Year,â€ and Mark Boal, the screenwriter of â€œThe Hurt Lockerâ€ and â€œZero Dark Thirty,â€ for the story of an audacious heist that's somewhere between greed and justice. Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal and Garrett Hedlund star as former Special Forces operatives who attempt to steal millions in cash from a South American drug cartel. The good news for them? The authorities won't care about a cartel getting robbed. The bad news? The cartel definitely will.â€˜The Death of Stalin'Starts streaming: March 22With â€œThe Thick of It,â€ â€œIn the Loopâ€ and â€œVeep,â€ Armando Iannucci firmly established himself as the most scabrous political satirist of the 21st century, but he goes back to the middle of the 20th for â€œThe Death of Stalin,â€ which digs into the chaos and folly that follow the death of a tyrannical dictator. The operatives surrounding Joseph Stalin in 1953 turn out to be just the sort of inept, backbiting sycophants that populate Iannucci's other comedies. What's different about â€œThe Death of Stalin,â€ beyond its sumptuous period trappings, is how well it captures the fear and paranoia that seized the Soviet Union during Stalin's rule and threw the country into a period of uncertainty after his death.â€˜The Dirt'Starts streaming: March 22Even by the hard-partying, substance-abusing, hotel-trashing standards of '80s hair-metal outfits, the members of MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e were notoriously rambunctious, turning world tours into grotesque bacchanals that occasionally veered into the dangerous and self-destructive. Their collaborative autobiography, â€œThe Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,â€ is a bracing read that chases stories of shocking indulgence with sobering notes about addiction and a deadly car crash. The Netflix adaptation was directed by Jeff Tremaine, the man responsible for the â€œJackassâ€ movies, which seems like the perfect match for this material. â€œBohemian Rhapsodyâ€ this is not.â€˜Kubo and the Two Strings'Starts streaming: March 23The Portland-based production house Laika has produced some of the most distinctive and sophisticated animated features of the last decade, using a 3-D stop-motion process to add tactility to odd little films like â€œCoraline,â€ â€œParaNormanâ€ and â€œThe Boxtrolls.â€ Laika's â€œKubo and the Two Stringsâ€ enters the world of ancient Japan, where a boy wielding a lute-like instrument called a samisen tells stories out of dancing origami papers, but whose own life is destined to become the stuff of legend. His quest to stop the evil Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is notably abstract for a mainstream family film, but it's mitigated by kid-friendly team-ups like a talking monkey (Charlize Theron) and a human-insect hybrid (Matthew McConaughey).â€˜The Highwaymen'Starts streaming: March 29Over 30 years ago, Kevin Costner popped on a period fedora and tracked down the country's most infamous criminals in â€œThe Untouchables.â€ He's doing it again in â€œThe Highwaymen,â€ this time as a quick-triggered Texas Ranger who comes out of retirement to catch Bonnie and Clyde. He and an ex-partner, played by Woody Harrelson, are given maximum latitude as special investigators to end a robbery and killing spree that has left 13 cops dead, along with many others. Telling the Bonnie and Clyde story from a lawman's perspective sounds a little square, given the groundbreaking swagger of the 1967 classic starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, but there's something to be said for playing a good story straight.â€˜Snowpiercer'Starts streaming: March 31The brilliant Korean genre director Bong Joon Ho (â€œThe Host,â€ â€œMotherâ€) made his English-language debut with this futuristic â€œShip of Fools,â€ in which the planet has been rendered uninhabitable and what remains of humankind is packed onto a train to nowhere. But the rules of society still apply: The have-nots are relegated to the dingy back cars of the train while the wealthy elite occupy spaces near the front, triggering a class war that threatens to send them off the tracks. Bong's diverse cast of American, British and Korean actors gives â€œSnowpiercerâ€ the right international flavor, but it's Tilda Swinton who dominates as a Margaret Thatcher type who's a merciless enforcer of the status quo.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]â€˜Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians'Starts streaming: March 1In December, the eight-episode Netflix documentary series â€œSunderland 'Til I Dieâ€ proved to be a fascinating look at a professional sports team during a serious inflection point in its history, when it was in danger of two straight relegations to lesser leagues. Now Netflix's latest sports-doc series, â€œCricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,â€ goes behind the scenes of a more successful franchise, the Mumbai Indians, as it tries to follow a championship year in the Indian Premier League. That's hardly the adversity faced by Sunderland, but in the cricket-crazed city of Mumbai, the pressure to repeat is enormous.â€˜Formula 1: Drive to Survive'Starts streaming: March 8The life and death of the Formula One racer Ayrton Senna was the subject of a uniquely compelling documentary, â€œSenna,â€ told entirely through archival footage of interviews, family videos and hair-raising moments from the racetrack. Now a producer from that film, James Gay-Rees, has returned to the same world with â€œFormula 1: Drive to Survive,â€ a 10-episode series about the athletes competing for the 2018 F.I.A. Formula One Championship, which starts in Melbourne, Australia, and ends in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Maneuvering lightweight vehicles at 200 m.p.h., the drivers risk their necks every time they turn the ignition, but they are able to check their daredevil impulses through intense focus, discipline and training.â€˜Arrested Development: Season 5B'Starts streaming: March 15Even before discussion of Jeffrey Tambor's alleged abusiveness on set derailed promotional efforts for the first half of its fifth season, â€œArrested Developmentâ€ has struggled to find the same absurdist groove of its original Fox run in its Netflix revival, despite enjoying fewer creative restrictions. Yet there's always the lingering hope that Mitchell Hurwitz's comic serial about the life and crimes of the Bluth family could turn things around. â€œSeason 5Bâ€ pivots around courtroom drama, as Buster (Tony Hale) stands trial for the murder of Lucille 2 (Liza Minnelli).â€˜Turn Up Charlie'Starts streaming: March 15Idris Elba isn't an actor known for his comic chops, but for a seven-episode run on the fifth season of â€œThe Office,â€ his seriousness and chiseled good looks were turned against him, exposing a well-disguised ineptitude. Created by Elba and Gary Reich, the British comedy series â€œTurn Up Charlieâ€ works a similar dynamic, casting Elba as a hapless DJ and bachelor whose weaknesses are further revealed when he has to play daddy to his famous friend's troublemaking daughter (Frankie Hervey). Elba does some DJ-ing on the side in real life, too, so at least that part of the show will stand to be authentic.â€˜Delhi Crime'Starts streaming: March 22In 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was gang raped and fatally beaten by six men on a private bus in South Delhi, a crime so horrific that thousands of protesters demanded (and received) legislative action to protect women against rape culture in India. The attack has been dramatized before, poorly, in Deepa Mehta's 2016 docudrama â€œAnatomy of Violence,â€ but the seven-part series â€œDelhi Crime,â€ by the Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta, was received more warmly out of Sundance. Mehta's series deals with the police effort to investigate the crime, focusing on a female officer (Shefali Shah) with a personal interest in bringing the perpetrators to justice.Also of interest: â€œA Monster Callsâ€ (March 1), â€œDog Daysâ€ (March 1), â€œSpace Jamâ€ (March 1), â€œThe Dark Knight Risesâ€ (March 1), â€œPatriot Act With Hasan Minhaj: Volume 2â€ (March 3), â€œChristopher Robinâ€ (March 5), â€œForgetting Sarah Marshallâ€ (March 6), â€œLucyâ€ (March 6), â€œAfter Lifeâ€ (March 8), â€œGirlâ€ (March 15), â€œLove, Death & Robotsâ€ (March 15), â€œSelling Sunsetâ€ (March 22), â€œThe Legend of Cocaine Islandâ€ (March 29)"
"Long before an ordinary chicken egg became an Instagram star, Jun Endo, a Ph.D. student at Kyoto University, sat gazing intently at another egg. This egg was much smaller, roughly the size of a sesame seed, and contained a stink bug.The mystery was this: When the egg finally hatched, it would do so virtually in unison with all the other stink bug eggs clumped around it. How? What signaled an egg on one side of the brood to hatch so soon after an egg on the other side?Synchronized hatching may be common in the animal world; scientist can't say for sure, as the phenomenon is not well studied. Sometimes bird eggs in the same clutch hatch individually, in a series that can unfold over more than a day. The broods of some stink bug species hatch over several hours. Mr. Endo's brood belonged to the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, which is known for wreaking havoc on farms and in suburban homes across the United States. Through a series of experiments, he attempted to identify the cue that got the eggs hatching. â€œAt first I had to consider every possibility — a sound, volatile chemical, vibration and pressure,â€ he said in an email. It was only when he played a vibration at a specific frequency, and the eggs promptly hatched, that he knew he was on the right track. Additional experiments confirmed that the vibration — brief, barely audible and recorded from a hatching stink-bug egg — signaled other eggs to follow suit. The discovery, described in a paper in Current Biology earlier this month, resonated not only with the stink-bug researchers of the world, but also with life-science researchers focused on biotremology, the science of vibrations.â€œNot many people know about it, but they should,â€ said Peggy Hill, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Tulsa, and author of a book called â€œVibrational Communication in Animals.â€ In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to the role that vibrations play in the lives of elephants, kangaroos, crickets and many other animals.â€œWhat makes it cool is that it's something we can't hear in the air,â€ Dr. Hill said. â€œBut it's an essential communication cue or signal.â€Hatching in unison is an advantage for the marmorated stink bug, said Hideharu Numata, a biologist at Kyoto University and an author of the new study. The hatched larvae won't eat other larvae, but they will eat the unhatched, so slowpokes risk being devoured by their new siblings. Last one out is an eaten egg.Dr. Numata has studied stink bugs for 30 years, and in that time has come to tolerate the stink. â€œI don't like this smell particularly, but I feel it's not so bad,â€ he said in an email. â€œStink bugs sometimes smell like some fruits.â€"
"HADDAM, Conn. — In row upon row, 436 tiny larvae are presumably fast asleep now, a few months after they were tucked inches deep into trenches dug along the sandy banks of the Connecticut River. The nestled larvae represent the last chance for one of New England's most endangered species, the Puritan tiger beetle — an insect tiny enough to fit on the pad of a thumb. The species only exists in small numbers in just two spots here, and another in the Chesapeake Bay area.  â€œThis is it for New England,â€ said Laura Saucier, a wildlife biologist for the state of Connecticut. â€œIf we lose our population in Connecticut, it's gone. The stakes are pretty high.â€Granted, the Puritan tiger beetle project — one of the largest insect reintroductions in the country — lacks the emotional appeal of protecting pandas or polar bears. â€œIt's not fuzzy and has a face only a mother could love, but they're just so interesting,â€ Dr. Saucier said. â€œThey're the top predators in this food web and the food web is down here,â€ she said, pointing to the sand, â€œso we don't know a lot about them.â€But for an ecosystem that runs from the Canadian border to the Long Island Sound, maintaining ecological balance is crucial, said Rodger Gwiazdowski, the entomologist who is leading the project and who has been dreaming for nearly two decades about restoring the Puritan tiger beetle.The beetles aren't an obvious missing link in an ecological chain; no other creature is known to have died or flourished as their numbers diminished, as far as Dr. Gwiazdowski knows. But â€œthey're part of a healthy river,â€ he said. â€œWhen we see a stretch of healthy river, we see beetles.â€ So, restoring them should help support the health of New England's longest river, whose watershed is home to more than 2 million people. â€œIt's powerfully naÃ¯ve to think it means nothingâ€ to allow the Puritan tiger beetles to disappear, he said.Which is why Dr. Gwiazdowski found himself motoring down the Connecticut River in October, remembering all he'd done to ensure that these immature beetles arrived safely at their destinations. If the boat should sink, he had a plan to float three tubs of beetle larvae to shore. Still, preparations and plans can go awry. One beach that he had staked out turned wetter than the week before, not ideal for larvae that can't swim. So rather than installing the larvae into several nearby plots, Dr. Gwiazdowski and crew were forced to release more than 200 of the larvae into one 12-meter stretch of relatively dry sand. There, the larvae created some sort of vertical bubble inside their burrows, protecting them from rising river levels.For the winter, the beetles are in a state of torpor — essentially hibernating — all season long. The more mature ones will emerge as adults some time early next summer, if all goes well. They can last the winter without food, but even the larvae are predators. They'll hide in their burrows, waiting for prey to walk by that they can pull down into their tunnel and consume. Their eyesight is among the most acute of any known insect and they display a very fast muscular response time, Dr. Gwiazdowski said. â€œComing and going, they're vicious predators.â€They look a lot like other tiger beetles, but have long strides, are slightly longer and sleeker, and their wing covers are a little shinier and more bronze. â€œEven in the sand, I can tell species apart by how they move,â€ he said. It's unclear when the Puritan tiger beetle began disappearing. It was first named in 1871, but wasn't nearly wiped out until the late 1980s, perhaps as the result of development along the river.Dr. Gwiazdowski doesn't want to pinpoint the locations where the beetles still live or where he's released the larvae. Insect collectors have been known to kill beetle populations, so he avoids specifics.For the release, he picked locations along the Connecticut that already had other species of tiger beetles — ones that are less selective and hardier than Puritans. He hopes their success means the Puritans will survive, too. But even if the Puritans all die, he said, from a scientific perspective the experiment will have been a success.â€œI can try and fail and that's O.K.,â€ Dr. Gwiazdowski said. â€œThe scientist in me doesn't care, as long as we know why.â€Last summer, Dr. Gwiazdowski and his team minded 30 or so pairs of adult Puritan tiger beetles they had caught in the spring, feeding them crickets and carefully harvesting their eggs every day, including weekends. Adults are easy to catch but hard to relocate, Dr. Gwiazdowski said. With previous releases of adults, the insects were never seen again, so scientists don't think the populations survived. The plan this time was to release larvae at different stages of development, hoping some would make it.Raised appropriately in captivity, each female can produce 100 or more offspring. But no one knew the optimal way to raise a Puritan tiger beetle — what kind of climate, prey or sand type.So the beetle team has been figuring it out by trial and error. Each breeding pair was kept in its own shoe-box sized plastic tub with a sand-filled Petri dish where researchers hoped the beetles would lay their eggs. Every weekday, a staff member sifted through the sandbox looking for eggs to remove, adding live crickets for food and replacing water in gel-form so the beetles could drink. The researchers couldn't put freshwater in the tubs, because the crickets — which apparently aren't very smart — would drown in it. Egg-laying provided another obstacle. Because beetles exist naturally on the flat surface of a beach, they weren't familiar with jumping or climbing into their makeshift sandboxes. Filling the tubs with too much sand would make the eggs difficult for researchers to find. Ramps of one type or another were too soft or too hard. Finally, the team obtained fresh clay from a quarry in Vermont. â€œThe day we put the clay ramps in, the fecundity exploded,â€ Dr. Gwiazdowski said.Restoring the Puritan tiger beetle's population had been a fantasy of his since he was an undergraduate student. But it wasn't until Dr. Gwiazdowski received a pilot grant in 2015 and another in 2017 from the Fish and Wildlife Service that he could start the reintroduction project. The challenge then became â€œhow to rear at scale,â€ he said. â€œNo one's done this before.â€He spent most of that money on salaries and on his Sunderland lab, housed in a former salmon hatchery, where multi-million-dollar, decades-long efforts to reintroduce East Coast salmon had failed. In giant tanks that once housed fish, he installed tubs of Puritan tiger beetles and enough insects to keep them well fed.All 463 larvae were raised in this room, whose climate was meant to constantly resemble a humid summer's day at the water's edge. A fan blew constantly across a humidifier, creating a fog-machine-like effect that kept the room at 60 to 80 percent humidity — enough to stop the sand from drying out, but not so much that the walls would mold.It takes two to three years for an egg to mature into an adult Puritan tiger beetle capable of reproduction. In the lab, scientists can speed up that process and keep adults alive longer.In nature, each female insect will reproduce herself — leaving on average one mature offspring behind, said Joe Elkinton, a professor of environmental conservation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who has collaborated with Dr. Gwiazdowski and helped with the release. But in captivity, insects can multiply themselves 100-fold in one generation, suggesting how many are lost to predators, starvation and other challenges. It also means that reared properly in a lab, it's feasible to mature enough larvae to make a difference at the population level, Dr. Elkinton said.Males are usually a little bit smaller than females. Researchers put a red dot on the males so they could be easily spotted and grabbed. From midsummer until the larvae collection was complete, the males were moved every day into a tub with a different female to promote breeding. Some females laid no eggs at all; one laid 126.â€œWhen you put life in a box, it gets very complicated very fast,â€ Dr. Gwiazdowski noted.Releasing the 463 larvae on the river banks was â€œlike kicking the kids out at 18,â€ Dr. Saucier joked. Dr. Gwiazdowski remained optimistic: â€œIt's easy to say goodbye. I'm really happy for them.â€[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"
"The brain-eating monsters are real enough — they lurk in freshwater ponds in much of the United States. Now scientists may have discovered a new way to kill them. Minuscule silver particles coated with anti-seizure drugs one day may be adapted to halt Naegleria fowleri, an exceptionally lethal microbe that invades through the sinuses and feeds on human brain tissue.The research, published in the journal Chemical Neuroscience, showed that repurposing seizure medicines and binding them to silver might kill the amoebae while sparing human cells. Scientists hope the findings will lay an early foundation for a quick cure.â€œHere is a nasty, often devastating infection that we don't have great treatments for,â€ said Dr. Edward T. Ryan, the director of the global infectious diseases division of Massachusetts General Hospital, who was not involved in the research. â€œThis work is clearly in the early stages, but it's an interesting take.â€Infections with brain-eating amoebae are rare but almost always deadly. Since 1962, only four of 143 known victims in the United States have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half of all cases have occurred in Texas and Florida, where the microscopic organisms thrive in warm pond water.â€œThe classic case is a 10-year-old boy who goes swimming in the South in the summer and starts to get a headache a few days later,â€ Dr. Ryan said. The amoebae's feeding causes meningoencephalitis — or swelling of the brain and nearby tissues — and is often misdiagnosed.â€œWhen it comes to treatment, doctors often end up throwing in the kitchen sink,â€ he added.Patients typically are given antimicrobial drugs in extremely high doses in order to break through the body's protective blood-brain barrier. Many suffer severe side effects.â€œThe biggest challenge is finding a drug that can actually reach the right region of the brain,â€ said Dr. Ayaz Anwar, a researcher at Sunway University in Malaysia, who led the new study. â€œWe need a drug that can trick the body into letting it through — and we know that anti-seizure drugs can overcome that barrier.â€Dr. Anwar and his team first treated the microbes with diazepam, phenobarbitone and phenytoin, three anti-seizure drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The amoebae proved sensitive. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The investigators then bound the medications to microscopic carriers: silver particles only 50 to 100 nanometers in diameter, or less than one-thousandth the width of a strand of hair.In laboratory testing, each of the three drug-silver combinations decreased the number of amoebae cells over time. Diazepam in particular was at least twice as effective when combined with silver.â€œIt was an exciting realization, that's for sure,â€ he said.Dr. Anwar said he planned to test the approach in animal models using crickets, cockroaches and mice.â€œIt's an important first step in coming up with possible treatments for a very difficult-to-treat condition,â€ said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. â€œBut this is still in a petri dish — it's a long way off from being implemented.â€"
"MUMBAI — For the uninitiated, kabaddi, the ancient Indian game that is taking the world's second-most populous country by storm, looks far too simple to be a professional sport.A hybrid of rugby, touch football and the playground game known in England as British Bulldog and in the United States as Red Rover (â€œRed rover, red rover, let Tommy come over...â€), kabaddi (pronounced kuh-bud-DEE) uses no balls, pucks, nets, goal posts, hoops, holes, rackets, clubs, sticks or bats. It is so unknown in the West that on August 8, 2017, ESPNU, the American digital cable and satellite sports television channel owned by ESPN Inc., showcased what it termed â€œthe finest in seldom seen sports,â€ including the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup Final. An exhibition match was played at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, but it did not catch on internationally.But those who take the time to examine India's rare homegrown game that is gaining appeal abroad begin to recognize a highly strategic endeavor that demands speed, strength, timing, an understanding of geometric angles and the kind of fancy footwork that would have impressed Muhammad Ali and Fred Astaire.Indians like that it's the only competition in the wide world of sports to require the player on offense to chant a word — â€œkabaddi,â€ derived from â€œkai-pidi,â€ meaning â€œto hold handsâ€ in the Tamil language — in one uninterrupted breath for the 30 seconds of his run at the defense. The sport takes its playbook from the Mahabharata, the 9th Century B.C.E. Hindu epic poem, where it's mentioned as a military formation called the Chakravyuha. It has been enjoyed for hundreds of years as a rural game played on India's dirt and mud fields.Now, with the establishment in 2014 of the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) and television coverage, as the league's sixth season is set to begin on Sunday, the sport has captured Indians' hearts, souls and TV remotes. Its popularity as a spectator sport is now second only to the British import cricket, which Indians still worship with near religious fervor. Last year some 313 million TV viewers watched league matches, according to Indian TV viewership surveys.Given kabaddi's recent gains, it should continue to penetrate the Indian market and may eventually even garner attention in the West.â€œKabaddi is a compelling gladiator-like sport — one man heroically pit against seven — with such old associations in India that I was immediately taken in,â€ said Ronnie Screwvala, the Indian multimedia entrepreneur who was the first person to acquire a team, U Mumba, when the league launched in 2014. â€œIndians have needed something they can claim as only theirs.â€The rules of the game and scoring are not intuitive to a Western sports fan watching it for the first several times.The basics are these: two teams of seven players each line up on either side of a 13-by-10 meter (42.6-by-32.8 feet) hard rubber mat, separated by a midline. There is something called a balk line behind that and a bonus line behind the balk line.To earn a point, one team sends out a solo â€œraider,â€ who must cross the centerline, tag an opposing player on the defense within 30 seconds, then cross back over the centerline to his side before being tackled. Players tackle each other with no holds barred, almost literally. Beyond that, scoring gets complicated for a kabaddi neophyte. Then the other team sends out a player, and on and on it goes for two fast-paced 20-minute halves.The game got a dressing up since its rural mud field days when Star TV India, an Asian television service owned by 21st Century Fox, teamed up with the league, which is owned by Mashal Sports, a Bangalore-based sports management company. Last year Star sold a 5-year sponsorship to Vivo, a Chinese technology company, for $47 million, that was the league's first corporate tie-in.The challenge for Star TV â€œwas unique in the history of televised sports,â€ said Uday Shankar, chief executive of the Indian channel. â€œFor a spectator sport in its embryonic stages, we've had to invent vocabulary for commentators, find directors who've had parallel experience, mostly from rugby, tweak some rules to make it TV-friendly, and even figure out what stats fans would want to track.â€Star also made the game more visually appealing for TV with flashing neon signage and smoke machines in arenas. Costumed crowd-rousing mascots bounce around before games and during breaks in the action. At least a dozen cameras catch it all.Mr. Screwvala gave his players a fashion makeover, â€œto make them look more appealing.â€ They got stylish haircuts and Oakley goggles to wear when not competing.Cumulative viewership for PKL matches rose from 217 million for Season 4 to 313 million for Season 5, according to Partho Dasgupta, chief executive of India's Broadcast Audience Research Council.PKL's Season 5 finale was the best rated non-cricket event on TV, with 26.2 million kabaddi viewers versus 55.6 million cricket fans, Mr. Dasgupta said.Mr. Shankar conceded it will take several more years before kabaddi begins to be profitable as a programming entity.In May, though, as owners bid on players for Season 6, Mr. Screwvala was ahead of the curve again, shelling out $138,690 for 26-year-old Fazel Atrachali, the Iranian defender who led the gold-winning Iranian team that beat India at the Asian Games in August. It's the highest amount ever paid for a non-Indian player. This may not seem like a lot compared to what cricketers and other major professional athletes earn in most countries, but it's a windfall considering the average annual per capita income in India is about $1,700.U Mumba also acquired Iran's Asian Games gold-winning coach, Amir Gholamreza Mazandarani, the first-ever foreign coach in the PKL.Of the 239 players selected to play for PKL's 12 teams, each team consisting of 18 to 24 players, 26 players come from some 14 Asian countries other than India, including South Korea, Iran, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Kenya, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Japan, Oman, Nepal, Thailand, Mauritius and Malaysia.â€œThis much foreign involvement in an India-born sport bodes very well for the sport here at home,â€ said Mr. Screwvala. â€œIn business, open competition always makes the good even better.â€An avid fan, he is often in the front row at U Mumba contests, with his wife Zarina and daughter Trishya Screwvala, all three jumping from their seats, cheering loudly at each score or tackle.Will the globalization of kabaddi catch on in the Americas and Europe?â€œWe can hope so, but it doesn't matter,â€ Mr. Screwvala said. â€œWe're just happy to see a homegrown product traveling to other shores, and spreading here.â€"
"NEVER HOME ALONE From Microbes to Millipedes, Camel Crickets, and Honeybees, the Natural History of Where We Live By Rob Dunn Illustrated. 323 pp. Basic Books. $30.A young man I know used to say that humans have no need to bathe, since our hair and bodies are designed to self-cleanse. I would fight him on it, being of the opinion that washing up occasionally was good for us — and for the people with whom we lived. But now, after reading the entomologist Rob Dunn's description of the myriad microbial life-forms that take up residence in a typical American showerhead, I'm starting to think maybe that young man was onto something.With an army of collaborators, Dunn, a professor of applied ecology at North Carolina State University, took samples of the gunk inside hundreds of showerheads, and found a profusion of microbial fauna. Tap water itself, he writes in the chatty, informative â€œNever Home Alone,â€ teems with amoebas, bacteria, nematodes and crustaceans. As the water passes through the showerhead, these microbes lay down a kind of scaffolding known as biofilm to protect themselves from getting washed away with every ablution. They make the biofilm â€œout of their own excretions,â€ Dunn writes bluntly. â€œIn essence, by working together, the bacteria poop a little indestructible condominium in your pipes.â€It gets worse. Filtered through that poop-biofilm, the water that washes over you, as you supposedly scrub yourself clean, might contain not only all those harmless amoebas and nematodes but a few bacteria that can be dangerous — in particular some species of Mycobacterium, cousins of the Mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis. And the pathogens are there because we provided the perfect breeding ground for them, when we tried to purify our tap water in the first place. Municipal water treatment plants use chlorine and other chemicals that kill off the bacterium's natural predators, allowing Mycobacterium to thrive. Tap water that comes from a well, in contrast, has never gone through a treatment plant and has a rich microbial life. It might look more dangerous, but it's actually safer, Dunn explains. All those organisms in well water are themselves harmless, and they tend to fight off the potentially dangerous ones like Mycobacterium — that's how biodiversity works.News from the showerhead biome is just one part of this fact-filled, occasionally disgusting, slightly alarming book. Dunn has been involved in an obsessive quest to document the tiny inhabitants of indoor environments, a project that involves teams of professional and amateur bug-watchers to take samples not only from showerheads but from door frames, refrigerators, hot water heaters, cellars, toilets, pillowcases, all sorts of surfaces from the places we call home. These workers swab and seal, swab and seal, and send their thousands of samples to Dunn's lab in Raleigh, or to his other lab at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, for an ongoing microbial census.â€œWe expected to find a few hundred species,â€ Dunn writes of his first foray into indoor microbe-hunting, which involved 1,000 homes from around the world. Instead, he and his colleagues found a â€œfloating, leaping, crawling circus of thousands of species,â€ perhaps as many as 200,000, many of them previously unknown to science.These denizens of interior spaces are our most frequent companions. In the industrialized world, we spend upward of 90 percent of our time indoors. Luckily, most of our co-habitators are either benign or actually beneficial in some way, like the house spiders that keep down indoor populations of flies or mosquitoes that can carry disease. But because we've become so hyper about making our surroundings as pristine as possible — sealing off our homes from the outdoors and using pesticides and antimicrobials with a vengeance — we've tipped the scales away from those harmless or helpful bugs, in favor of some of the bad guys.According to Dunn, indoor microbes are among the fastest-evolving species on the planet; they have an uncanny ability to live in ecological niches you could hardly imagine existing, like the dead skin cells we slough off every day (which is all that's needed to survive for a class of bacteria known as detritivores). They manage to evade our assaults, and evolve their way out of just about every biocide we throw at them. We're left to contend with the consequences of our own warfare, such as pesticide-resistant German cockroaches and bedbugs, and antibiotic-resistant MRSA bacteria. We have turned a relatively harmless indoor biome into something that can make us sick.That's the take-home message of â€œNever Home Alone,"" that the richer the biodiversity in our indoor environment, the better. â€œThe biodiversity of plants and soil can help our immune systems function properly,â€ Dunn writes. â€œThe biodiversity in our water systems can help keep pathogens in the water in check. â€¦ The biodiversity of spiders, parasitoid wasps and centipedes can help control pests. The biodiversity in our houses provides the opportunity, too, for the discovery of enzymes, genes and species useful to all of us, whether to make new kinds of beers or to transform waste into energy.â€I'm not quite as enamored of our microbial roommates as the author is. (I'm sorry, Professor Dunn, but I'm just being honest here: Those photos of the camel cricket and the American grass spider clinging to basement pipes and door thresholds — well, yuck.) It probably takes the soul of an entomologist, or maybe of a 9-year-old child, to love these bugs as much as Dunn does. Still, it's hard not to be occasionally charmed by his prose, as when he catalogs the arthropods with whom we share our homes: â€œbiting midges, mosquitoes, lesser house flies, phantom midges, freeloader flies and shore flies. This is not to mention fungus gnats, moth flies and flesh flies. Or crane flies, winter crane flies and minute black scavenger flies.â€ And it's hard not to share, at least a little, his awe at their diversity, even in a single household. â€œIf you see two flies in your home,â€ he writes, â€œthe odds are that they are two different species. Heck, if you see 10 flies in your house, they are likely to be five different species.â€And don't even get him started on the aphids. He's amazed by them, as he is by â€œthe wasps that lay their eggs in the bodies of aphids as well as the wasps that lay their eggs in the bodies of the wasps that lay their eggs in the bodies of aphids.â€There's a real sense of â€œgee-whizâ€ in this book, but it's mostly in service of Dunn's overarching goal: to preach the preservation of biodiversity, not only in the lush forests and streams that fit our traditional image of nature's abundance, but in the most humble places, too, where the vast majority of us will have most of our cross-species encounters — our basements, mattresses, refrigerator drawers and showerheads.About those showerheads: Dunn isn't suggesting that we give up showers. But he does say we might want to change the showerhead a little more often — and consider switching from metal to plastic, where biofilm is less likely to accumulate. Nonetheless, his bottom line for showerheads is like his bottom line for other aspects of the roiling microbial mix we live in: Don't be afraid of letting life inside. â€œThe water that is healthiest for bathing is that which comes from aquifers rich with underground biodiversity including crustaceans,â€ he writes. â€œThe crustaceans in these aquifers are an indication not of the dirtiness of the water but of its health.â€"
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan said on Tuesday that it would take new steps to seize and freeze the assets of people and militant groups who are on the United Nations' list of designated terrorists, after months of international criticism.The announcement came as India and Pakistan were still on edge after a suicide bombing in Kashmir last month led to a military clash between the two. And last month, a financial watchdog group, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, said Pakistan was still not taking enough concrete steps to curb financing and money laundering by terrorist groups.Pakistan risks being blacklisted by the task force, which would open the door to international sanctions that would be devastating to the country's already teetering economy.Pakistan's military has long been accused by its neighbors and Western countries of cultivating militant groups to use as proxies, including the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was widely accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed more than 160 people.The financial task force demanded more action in particular against Lashkar-e-Taiba and against Jaish-e-Muhammad, a militant group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers.â€œThere is a total consensus across all state institutions that these religious militias of all kinds represent a liability from the 1990s, a baggage of the past,â€ Moeed Pirzada, an analyst and television news host who has been briefed by civilian and military officials, said in an interview on Tuesday. â€œThey don't serve any purpose and need to be absorbed into mainstream society through alternate job creation.â€Mr. Pirzada said the main challenge was to make inroads against such groups by taking over the religious schools, hospitals and relief organizations that they operate as fronts. Prime Minister Imran Khan's government made some budgetary allowances for those actions in December, he said.[An American cricket club carries on despite India-Pakistan tensions.]On Tuesday, Pakistani officials promised to take stronger action in the coming weeks against militant groups that operate inside Pakistani territory.Pakistan has made those promises before, including when it was put on the financial task force's so-called gray list early last year, at the request of the Trump administration.But Pakistani officials say that there is greater urgency now, and that Mr. Khan's administration is worried about becoming an international pariah if it fails to act. On Monday evening, Mr. Khan gave a rare background briefing to news show hosts in which he reportedly emphasized that the time had come to do more to crack down on militant groups.Pakistani officials say they plan to freeze the assets of more groups, and to take control of religious seminaries that are affiliated with them. The officials said that more travel restrictions would also be imposed on militant leaders.In an initial sign of a crackdown, the Pakistani authorities have detained 44 people, including the brother and son of Masood Azhar, the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad. Shehryar Afridi, the state minister for interior, who announced the move during a news conference in Islamabad, did not specify any charges and said the detentions were meant for investigations.Mr. Afridi said the names of Mufti Abdur Raoof, the brother of Mr. Azhar, and Hammad Azhar, the son of Mr. Azhar, were included in a dossier that Indian authorities handed to Pakistan for investigations into the Feb. 14 Kashmir attack.Azam Suleman Khan, the interior secretary, said those detained would be freed if found innocent. â€œIn case we don't find any evidence against them, we will release them,â€ Mr. Khan said.As Pakistan continued to extend gestures that it wanted normalization of ties, its Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Sohail Mehmood, the country's ambassador to India, would return to New Delhi to resume his duties. The ambassador was recalled to Islamabad last month after tensions erupted over the Kashmir attack.Pakistan also said on Tuesday that a delegation would visit India on March 14 to discuss a draft agreement on a Sikh pilgrimage corridor between the estranged neighbors.

"WELLINGTON — For 23 years the name Crusaders was a source of nothing but pride in Christchurch, the uncontroversial identity of a franchise that claims, with some justification, to be the most successful non-national professional rugby team in the world.The city was changed forever on March 15, however, when 50 people were killed and dozens more injured by a suspected white supremacist in shootings during Friday prayers at two Christchurch mosques.And after the wave of self-examination that swept across New Zealand in the wake of the attacks, it looks like there might now be nominative change afoot for the nine-times rugby champions of the southern hemisphere. The juxtaposition of a city embracing those impacted by the attacks with a nickname that recalls medieval wars between Christians and Muslims was quickly recognized on social media with some calling for the Crusaders to be renamed. The country's Sports Minister Grant Robertson said it was a ""responsible action"" to reconsider the name and the Crusaders, after initially saying it merely reflected ""the crusading spirit of this community"", agreed to at least discuss it.While the Crusaders told Reuters last week they were still considering a time frame and process, several fans at the team's match in Wellington last weekend were of the view that it was ""just a name"", albeit one they wanted to keep. ""I think that they have to have a chat to the Muslim community and ask 'are you okay with this?',"" Scott Wilson, a decorator from Christchurch, told Reuters. ""I don't think they should change (but) I think it might have been more prudent to think about the name before they adopted it.""While the name change has been debated widely in the rugby-mad country, Muslim groups have not engaged. The Federation of Islamic associations of New Zealand did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. SWORD-WIELDING KNIGHTThe Crusaders name was adopted by the Canterbury Rugby Union and five neighboring provinces when rugby went professional in 1996 and they were granted a franchise to compete in the competition that became Super Rugby.New Zealand Rugby made the final decision and chief executive Steve Tew -- who in 1996 held a similar post at the Crusaders -- said any changes would still need their approval. The team logo has always featured a sword-wielding knight, while pre-match entertainment at home games has traditionally involved horsemen dressed in chain mail riding around the pitch.This is not the first time the appropriateness of such imagery being used to promote sporting contests in increasingly multicultural western countries has been questioned.Several collegiate teams in the United States, including Alvernia University and Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania, have jettisoned Crusaders mascots and nicknames in recent years, as did England's Middlesex Cricket Club in 2008. Native Americans have also protested against team names and logos in professional American sport that appropriate, or worse mock, their culture.While baseball's Atlanta Braves and the National Football League's Washington Redskins have retained their names and imagery, there has been some change. Major League Baseball team the Cleveland Indians announced in January that the caricature of a Native American warrior known as ""Chief Wahoo"" would be removed from their uniforms from the 2019 season. ""OPEN-MINDED AND PROGRESSIVE"" Re-branding an organization as successful as the Crusaders should not be too challenging as long as it was recognized from the start that they could not please everyone, according to marketing academic and branding consultant Dr Michael Lee. ""If the team culture is healthy and they do a lot of good things for society and their community then you don't want to change that. All you do is change the name,"" Lee, an Associate Professor at the University of Auckland, told Reuters. ""You still have the same values -- you're a stand up citizen, do the right thing, help out when needed, all those sorts of values and the brand essence can stay the same, so in this situation it is really just changing the name.""The national conversation about underlying racism in New Zealand triggered by the mosque shootings could also help ease any name transition, he added. ""Within the current climate, I can see why this rebranding has a little bit more impetus to it than other brands,"" Lee said. ""There are going to be people who are really annoyed ... but New Zealand is very open minded and progressive. ""If a top team like the Crusaders did change their name then that would spark a discussion in the rest of the world as to whether they need to address other similar issues."" Michael Wagteveld, President of the Canterbury Rugby Supporters Club, told Reuters his body would support whatever decision the team made.There looks certain to be at least some change on Saturday when the Crusaders play their first home match since the shootings, with chief executive Colin Mansbridge suggesting the mounted knights would be given the evening off.""It's not unequivocal yet, but they're unlikely to be there and the game will reflect the occasion,"" he told local media last week.

"Seth MacFarlane's â€œStar Trekâ€ sendup returns to Fox. And an adaptation of an Aravind Adiga novel debuts on Netflix.THE ORVILLE 8 p.m. on Fox. When this series debuted last year, it marked a bit of a departure for Seth MacFarlane, the â€œFamily Guyâ€ funnyman. The high-energy, animated vulgarity of that show and MacFarlane's â€œAmerican Dadâ€ is dialed down here, replaced with drier humor and a heavy helping of â€œStar Trekâ€ — which is being parodied. MacFarlane plays the captain of a spaceship and crew in uniforms who shoot blasters that would blend right in at a Trekkie convention. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the show â€œemulates the original â€˜Trek' series to a degree somewhere between sincere homage and creepy necrophilia.â€ It returns for a second season after a yearlong hiatus.SPACE JAM (1996) 10 p.m. on VH1. This quintessential '90s kids movie places an animated Bugs Bunny alongside Michael Jordan. Danny DeVito voices the bad guy.SELECTION DAY on Netflix. In his 2016 novel, â€œSelection Day,â€ the writer Aravind Adiga (who won the Man Booker Prize in 2008 for â€œThe White Tigerâ€) explored the lives of a pair of brothers living in a Mumbai slum. They're raised under the domineering eye of their father, who is set on his sons becoming cricket stars; anything else is, to him, a distraction. Netflix has adapted the novel into an original series, which debuts Sunday.JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT: THE RADIANT CHILD (2010) on Amazon, iTunes and Mubi. A few years before his premature death of a heroin overdose in 1988, the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat was filmed by the director Tamra Davis in a rare interview, by Becky Johnson. That footage wasn't released at the time. Davis ended up using it as the centerpiece of this documentary profile of the artist, which also has interviews with some of Basquiat's peers, like the artist Julian Schnabel. In his review for The Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film â€œplaces Basquiat's art in a cultural context with an enthusiasm and zest that make the many pictures shown come blazingly alive.â€EATING ANIMALS (2018) on Hulu. Natalie Portman is now on movie theater screens in Brady Corbet's â€œVox Lux,â€ a film that addresses two complicated elements of modern American life: mass shootings and pop stars. In â€œEating Animals,â€ she takes on a third: factory farming. Following in the footsteps of â€œFood, Inc.â€ and Eric Schlosser's â€œFast Food Nation,â€ Christopher Dillon Quinn's documentary adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's 2009 book — with Portman as a narrator — forces audiences to think about where their food comes from. In his review for The Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film skewers factory farming â€œfrom philosophical, epidemiological and even economic perspectives.â€ He noted that â€œit seems impossible to come away from it without wanting to know more about where your meat comes from.â€ It hits Hulu right in time to inspire New Year's resolutions."
"(Reuters) - A brawl between World Wrestling Entertainment Inc's bears and bulls could reach a peak this year as the company renegotiates overseas contracts. While a large contingent of short sellers have been betting that the stock will fall, WWE's most ardent Wall Street fans say it will continue to rise even after outperforming the stock market last year and for much of 2019.Shares in WWE soared 144 percent in 2018 as U.S. TV license deals blew past analyst expectations with a 3.6-times hike in average annual value from its previous agreements. The stock has risen another 12.6 percent so far this year as investors are betting on license renewals being negotiated in countries including India and the United Kingdom, which WWE expects to announce by mid-year. Ten out of 13 analysts have buy ratings on the stock while three recommend holding the stock which last traded at $84.87. The mean share price target is $102.70 with the highest target at $157 and the lowest at $85, according to Refinitiv.While the stock has already risen a lot on expectations for new business, Gabelli Funds analyst Alexandra Cowie says it still has room to gain further. ""I wouldn't be selling before the contract news. Going in and coming out of announcements, it gets a double bump,"" said Cowie, whose firm owns more than 174,000 WWE shares. WWE is in an unusual entertainment category. Unlike traditional sports, its fights are scripted, but analysts measure its popularity against sports because it still involves athleticism and suspense.The creator of Smackdown and Raw TV shows boasted a U.S. cable television viewership second only to the National Football League in 2018, according to Nielsen data. And in India, WWE viewership was second only to cricket, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council.Guggenheim Securities analyst Curry Baker expects a UK renewal similar to WWE's current contract there. But he anticipates a fivefold boost to its average annual revenue in India to $124 million. ""The market is underappreciating the India opportunity,"" said Baker who has a $105 price target and a buy rating on WWE.MKM analyst Eric Handler, who raised his price target for the stock to $110 from $95 on Tuesday, says a possible U.S. deal for a third weekly hour of Smackdown could add $50 million to annual revenue. The company declined to comment on the prospect of an additional hour. WWE shares have fallen roughly 9 percent since last Thursday. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Vincent McMahon sold 3.2 million of his shares, or four percent of WWE's shares outstanding, to fund a separate entity. The stock last traded down 0.9 percent on Thursday in active trade though analysts said the news did not change their outlook It has also come under pressure as the broader market has been losing ground on worries about global economic growth. But analysts say WWE contracts - which are for around three to five years - provide some insulation against economic fluctuations. In the United States, live sports have been a key draw for cable TV subscribers, at a time when many consumers are cutting the chord to avoid high monthly fees. ""It feels like one of the lower-risk higher-return names in the media space,"" said Baker.Still, about 17 percent of WWE's float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners which estimates short seller mark-to-market losses of $359 million since the start of 2018. The bets against the stock can be partly attributed to hedging by investors in its convertible bonds due in 2023, according to BTIG analyst Brandon Ross. â€œThat's contributed to it,â€ he said.Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker is Wall Street's biggest fan, with a price target of $157. Wall Street expects 2020 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $460.59 million on $1.33 billion revenue, according to Refinitiv data. Ryvicker expects EBITDA of $510 million on revenue of $1.423 billion. With this in mind, Ryvicker says WWE looks cheap compared with other sports peers, including Knicks basketball team owner Madison Square Garden Co and a Liberty Media Corp subsidiary which owns Formula One rights and Liberty's subsidiary that owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team.WWE's enterprise value is roughly 14.8 times her 2020 EBITDA estimates compared with multiples of 32 for Madison Square Garden, 33.2 for Liberty's Atlanta Braves subsidiary and 12.6 for the Formula One subsidiary, the analyst wrote. WWE ""has no reason not to trade right in-line with its closest peers,"" Ryvicker said.

"(Reuters) - David Warner continued to blaze his way through the Indian Premier League with the bat but his misfield helped Kings XI Punjab to a dramatic victory over his Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday.The aggressive opener scored 70 not out from 62 balls for the Sunrisers, confirming his strong form ahead of his expected return to the Australia team for the 50-overs World Cup in England and Wales.It was his third half century in six matches and extended his hold at the top of the IPL run-scoring table with 349 runs at an average of 87.25.He has scored a century in addition to the three half centuries, indicating there is little rust in his game despite the one-year international ban for his part in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal.The suspension ended on March 29 and the 32-year-old is all but certain to be included in Australia's squad for the May 31-July 14 World Cup when it is announced this week.While Warner batted the entire 20 overs of Hyderabad's innings, tight bowling and muggy conditions in Mohali meant he was required to work hard as he guided his side 150 for four.India opener KL Rahul's 71 not out then led the Kings XI to a six-wicket victory with a ball to spare.Hyderabad did well to force the game into a final over by taking three quick wickets for eight runs in just 12 balls, leaving Punjab needing 11 runs from the last six.Rahul and England all-rounder Sam Curran scored nine from Mohammad Nabi's first four deliveries before Rahul hit the ball to Warner at long on.Warner fumbled it then slipped over on the dewy surface as he went to retrieve it, allowing Rahul and Curran to scamper through for the victory.Punjab are third in the IPL standings with four wins from six matches, trailing Kolkata and Chennai, who have both played only five games, on net run rate. Hyderabad are fourth with three wins and three losses. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Nick Mulvenney)"
"MUMBAI — The English weather will play a major role during the World Cup and teams from the Indian subcontinent stand to gain if hot and dry conditions prevail during the May 30-July 14 tournament, former captain Kevin Pietersen has said.England, which last hosted the quadrennial showpiece in 1999, has witnessed more batsmen-friendly conditions in recent past with scores of 300 regularly posted in one-day internationals held in the country.A hot English summer will translate into dry pitches on which the batsmen and spinners from the subcontinent teams are expected to thrive.""It is going to be weather dependent,"" Pietersen told reporters in Mumbai at a promotional event last week.""Last year was one of the most beautiful English summers since 1976. It was the hottest summer recorded in the UK with hardly any rain at all, conditions were extremely dry.""If the conditions are like they were last summer, then I think the subcontinent teams are going to have a massive role to play in the World Cup.""If they are not and it's horrible and green and seaming, then it's going to play in England's favour and the team that copes best in those circumstances.""While many see it as England's best chance to win their maiden 50-overs World Cup, India will also be among the favourites.Led by Virat Kohli, the two-time champions have more or less a settled batting line-up even though they continue to search for a reliable number four in the batting order.Opener Rohit Sharma agreed the English conditions could have a big say on their team selection.""I think we are pretty much settled. There are a few spots which everyone know about,"" Rohit, Kohli's deputy in limited-overs formats, said. ""It all depends on what the captain, coach and selectors think about the combination. Whether we need to go with the extra seamer, extra middle order batsman, extra opening batsman or an extra spinner. ""The conditions in England will matter the most. The last time when we were there the conditions were really dry. I don't know if it will be the same again. If it is like that then we need to get an extra spinner, as simple as that. If it's not then we should probably get an extra seamer.""All 10 participating teams will have to submit their 15-member squads by April 23, while injury replacements can be named until May 23.

"(Reuters) - Fast bowler Sam Curran picked up four wickets for 11 runs, including the season's first hat-trick, to propel Kings XI Punjab to a 14-run victory over Delhi Capitals on Monday.Chasing 167 for victory, the Capitals looked to be cruising at 144/3 in the 17th over with Rishabh Pant and Colin Ingram at the crease. But they lost seven wickets for eight runs as the Kings XI bowlers ripped through the batting line-up.Pant lost his wicket trying to smash the ball down the leg side when Mohamed Shami castled the 21-year-old for 39 before Ravichandran Ashwin sent Chris Morris back with a direct hit to run him out in the very next ball.Ingram did not last long either as he holed out to long off to give Curran his first wicket. The left-arm bowler then cleaned up the tail with a hat-trick spread across two overs.He first had Harshal Patel caught behind before getting Kagiso Rabada and Sandeep Lamichhane both bowled off the first two balls of the final over to send the Mohali crowd into raptures.Earlier, Kings XI were put into bat by the Capitals and scored 166/9 in their allotted 20 overs, with David Miller scoring 43 and Sarfaraz Khan chipping in with 39. Morris picked up three wickets while Rabada and Lamichhane got two each.Kings XI have moved up to second as a result with six points, behind leaders Chennai Super Kings on net run rate, while the Capitals remain in fifth place.

"(Reuters) - David Warner and Jonny Bairstow set a record for the highest opening stand in the Indian Premier League (IPL), with both players notching centuries for Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday.Warner and Bairstow put on 185 in just 16.2 overs in a 118-run victory over Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore, surpassing Gautam Gambhir and Chris Lynn's opening stand of 184 against Gujarat Lions in the 2017 season.Former Australia vice-captain Warner is fighting for a spot in their World Cup squad after completing a 12-month suspension for his involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town last year.The 32-year-old showed he has lost none of his power-hitting ability as he finished unbeaten on 100 from 55 balls, which included five fours and five sixes.Warner was playing the anchor role, while Bairstow stepped up the scoring rate to belt 114 from 56 deliveries, before falling to Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal.England opener Bairstow smashed 12 fours and seven sixes for his second-ever Twenty20 hundred, while Warner recorded his third consecutive 50-plus score to top the IPL scoring charts this season.""He's great fun, just going ahead with hitting the ball,"" Bairstow said of Warner after Hyderabad finished with 231-2. ""It's fantastic to bat in the middle with him.""With the colossal partnership in Hyderabad, Warner and Bairstow also became the first pair to make three consecutive 100-run partnerships in the IPL.""Must say everything about their partnership has been extraordinary.

Truly remarkable,"" Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar said on Twitter.Chasing 232 to win, Bangalore lost five wickets for just 30 runs, including captain Kohli and South African talisman AB de Villiers.Afghanistan off-spinner Mohammad Nabi finished with four wickets for Hyderabad as the hosts clinched a convincing victory.

"(Reuters) - Australia clinched a dramatic six-run victory over Pakistan on Friday, despite Pakistan debutant Abid Ali and in-form Mohammad Rizwan hitting centuries in the fourth one-day international in Dubai.Chasing 278 to win, Pakistan were in cruise control with Abid and Rizwan adding 144 runs to take the total to 218-3 before the middle order imploded in familiar fashion.Ali, whose 112 off 119 balls was Pakistan's record ODI score on debut at the age of 31, holed out to leg-spinner Adam Zampa.Umar Akmal and debutant Saad Ali fell for seven each to paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile, who finished with 3-53, while Marcus Stoinis removed Rizwan (104) and Usman Shinwari (six) in the final over to seal Australia's seventh consecutive ODI win.It was only the fourth time in history that a side has lost an ODI chase with two centurions. ""I thought our composure with the ball was really good,"" said Australia captain Aaron Finch. ""We knew how slow the wicket was, we knew if we could get some new batters in it would be tough. Credit to our boys, though Abid and Rizwan getting hundreds were great knocks."" Earlier, Glenn Maxwell fell short of a fighting hundred by two runs but guided Australia to a competitive 277-7 on a slow track, repairing the innings alongside wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey (55).The 30-year-old Maxwell was closing in on his first ODI century in four years but was run out while selflessly chasing a second run in the final over of the innings.Sent out to bat first, Australia began steadily as in-form openers Finch and Usman Khawaja stitched together a 56-run partnership in 12 overs.Finch was first to depart when he was trapped leg-before by fast bowler Mohammad Hasnain before Shaun Marsh and Peter Handscomb fell to Imad Wasim's left-arm spin.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah removed Stoinis and Khawaja, who finished with 62.That left Maxwell and Carey with a rebuilding job and they combined for a sixth-wicket stand of 134 runs, stepping up the scoring rate in the final 10 overs.Australia lead the five-match series 4-0 with the final match scheduled in Dubai on Sunday.

"(Reuters) - Australia cruised to an 80-run victory over Pakistan in the third one-dayer in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday and took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.Captain Aaron Finch fell 10 runs short of becoming the first Australian to score three consecutive ODI centuries but negotiated difficult conditions to help his team finish with a decent total of 266-6.The right-handed opener made 90 off 136 deliveries before Glenn Maxwell stepped up the scoring rate with a 55-ball 71 on a pitch that offered more assistance to the bowlers than the last two matches in Sharjah.It was Maxwell's highest ODI score in over two years, giving him an edge in intense competition for the middle-order batting spots for the World Cup starting on May 30 in England and Wales.""It wasn't the easiest wicket to start on,"" Maxwell said. ""Once I got through that, it got easier.""We've been really focussed about what we want to do here. We want to build on this momentum ... It's been a continual build for our team since last year, and we're starting to get it right."" Finch, whose role as a captain was questioned a month ago because of his form slump, has responded with 479 runs in his last six one-day innings.The 32-year-old was perfectly placed for a 14th hundred in the 50-overs format but holed out to leg-spinner Yasir Shah in the 42nd over.Maxwell and wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey (25 not out) added a quickfire 61 for the sixth wicket as Australia hit 90 in the last 10 overs.Chasing a target of 267, Pakistan were rattled by a testing new-ball spell from Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins, who removed opener Shan Masood, Haris Sohail and Mohammad Rizwan with just 16 runs on the board.Imam-ul-Haq and captain Shoaib Malik shared a 59-run partnership for the fourth wicket before the Australian spinners stepped up.Part-time off-spinner Maxwell trapped Imam lbw for 46 and Nathan Lyon removed Malik for 32, leaving Pakistan on the brink of a fourth straight defeat in the format.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa hurried through the tail with a career-best ODI spell of 4-43 to bowl out Pakistan for 186 in the 45th over.The win was Australia's sixth in a row after their 3-2 comeback victory in the series in India this month.

"MELBOURNE — Fitting the disgraced duo of Steve Smith and David Warner into Australia's World Cup squad will be ""bloody hard"" given the side's resurgence without them, according to captain Aaron Finch.Both Smith and Warner are eligible to return to the national side after their 12-month suspensions for ball-tampering ended on Thursday.Australia beat Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in their five-match ODI series, and have now won six matches in succession after coming back to defeat India 3-2 away.Finch said it would be tough for selectors to decide who to leave out of the 15-man squad for the May 30-July 14 World Cup in England.""It is bloody hard,"" he said.""Especially when the side is playing so well, it's going to be difficult. No matter who it is.""At the end of the day ... it's an incredibly tough decision. Whatever balance you go with in that 15-man squad, there's going to be some very unlucky blokes out there.""One could be Usman Khawaja, formerly a fringe member of the one-day side, who has flourished opening the batting with Finch since his recall in January, with 609 runs at an average of 55.36.The left-hander could make way for Warner, who has scored more than 4,300 one-day runs and 14 centuries, in an explosive opening combination with Finch.Smith, who has only just returned from elbow surgery, would complement a middle order of Shaun Marsh and Peter Handscomb, with all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell providing power-hitting through the lower-middle order.Having struggled for a period without Smith and Warner, Finch's side have shown the kind of form that propelled them to a fifth World Cup title four years ago on home soil.Finch said consistency of selection had aided their turnaround.""The fact that guys are getting more of an opportunity to keep developing their role, and developing the role they've been asked to play or the game demands, is gold,"" he said.""That probably goes under the radar a little bit when you're looking at teams that have been successful in the past.""I think leading up to the 2015 World Cup, we'd had the same 15 players for a good 18 months or so.

"LONDON — Theresa May is set to join the ranks of Conservative prime ministers whose time in office has been overwhelmed — and cut short — by the issue of Europe.Ever since Edward Heath took the U.K. into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the Conservative Party has been anguished by how close the country's ties should be with the continent.All of Heath's Conservative successors in 10 Downing Street — Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron — have been swamped by Europe. On Wednesday, May told lawmakers from her own party that she will step down once she has secured Britain's departure from the European Union. Though the actual Brexit date remains clouded in mystery, few expect May to last more than a few more months.""Throughout my adult lifetime, every Conservative prime minister has been brought down by Europe,"" Damian Green, a long-time close associate of May and a former member of her Cabinet, told BBC radio Thursday.""For a successful political party that represents a very significant part of this country .... that is extraordinary.""___EDWARD HEATH, Prime Minister 1970-1974On taking office, Heath made membership of the EEC a key objective. He was fortunate to have in Georges Pompidou a French president more amenable to the prospect of Britain joining the bloc than his predecessor Charles de Gaulle, who twice in the 1960s vetoed British membership.In October 1971, the House of Commons voted by a margin of 356 votes to 244 to join the EEC in 1973, with a sizeable chunk of Heath's own party voting against. Though Heath and the Conservatives were voted out of office a year later after an economic crisis, his passionate pro-European stance weighed against him when Thatcher challenged him for the party's leadership in 1975.___MARGARET THATCHER, Prime Minister 1979-1990Thatcher was a keen backer of the EEC at first — she even wore a sweater with the flags of the member countries during Britain's first referendum on membership of the bloc in 1975. But her 11 years in Downing Street were marked by growing opposition to Europe.Though her government backed the creation of the single European market in the mid-1980s, she became increasingly hostile to the move to further integrate European countries.The appointment of French socialist Jacques Delors to head the executive European Commission added fuel to her fire. Thatcher and a growing part of the Conservative Party were aghast at Delors' ambition for a single currency.In a 1988 speech, Thatcher rejected the prospect of a ""European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" Not everyone in her party was that hostile, and Thatcher's growing antipathy to Europe prompted the 1990 resignation of her deputy.In a cricket reference, Geoffrey Howe savaged Thatcher, arguing that she was sabotaging discussions with Europe: ""It's rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find the moment the first balls are bowled, their bats have been broken by the team captain.""Thatcher's time was up.___JOHN MAJOR, Prime Minister 1990-1997Her successor, John Major, sought to mend fences with Europe, even while keeping Britain out of the single currency. His government would soon after descend into civil war over the Maastricht Treaty, which bolstered integration on an array of issues, including foreign policy, and led to the creation of what is now known as the European Union.Many of the hard-line euroskeptic lawmakers who have bedeviled May's leadership came to the fore during Major's premiership. John Redwood, one of the more passionate Brexit-backers in Parliament, challenged Major for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1995. Though he lost overwhelmingly, it was clear that the party was riven by the issue of Europe, both in parliament and beyond.Hugely divided, the Conservatives, after 18 years in office, suffered one of their worst defeats in history in 1997 in an election that saw Tony Blair lead a decidedly pro-European Labour Party into power. His ambition was to put Britain at the ""heart of Europe"" and he even indicated a willingness for the country to join the euro, which launched in 1999.___DAVID CAMERON, Prime Minister 2010-2016During the Blair years, the Conservatives became more and more hostile to the EU. But Cameron promised that his party would no longer carry on ""banging on about Europe.""Despite his intention, Cameron couldn't avoid the issue of Europe when becoming prime minister in 2010, leading a coalition with the far-more pro-European Liberal Democrats. With the U.K. Independence Party making headway with its demand for a fresh vote on Britain's membership, and its assertion that Britain had ceded too much sovereignty to Brussels, Cameron felt compelled to promise a referendum to bind his party together.That referendum took place on June 23, 2016 and the British people voted by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the EU. Cameron resigned the day after and May won the ensuing succession battle on a promise to deliver Brexit.Nearly three years on, that's proven more difficult than she could possibly have imagined. And in perhaps her final roll of the dice, she has promised to step down if Parliament backs her twice-rejected Brexit deal.Whenever she leaves, her successor, whoever he or she is, will likely face the same problems.""Prediction: the same fate awaits her successor, whoever it is,"" Nick Boles, a Conservative lawmaker, tweeted soon after May's announcement.___Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit"
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan has introduced an ambitious poverty alleviation plan that he says would help the country's poorest gain better access to health care, education, and employment.Mr. Khan said his government would allocate 80 billion rupees — more than half a billion dollars — for an anti-poverty plan known as â€œEhsas,â€ or Empathy, and raise it to 120 billion rupees by 2021.â€œNo Pakistani government has spent so much money on alleviating poverty in the past,â€ Mr. Khan said Wednesday during a ceremony in Islamabad, the capital. â€œThe government has launched a war against poverty.â€Pakistan has an estimated population of 207.2 million people, almost a quarter of whom live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.Fighting poverty was a central issue of his campaign when he won the general elections in July. But implementing that promise — and particularly the Ehsas plan, which is at its heart the establishment of a welfare state — will be exceptionally difficult, given the country's economic crisis.Pakistan is facing a worsening balance-of-payments crisis and is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package. Pakistan has also looked for financial support from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.The I.M.F. has said that Pakistan has low international reserves and a high fiscal and current account deficit. Talks between Pakistan and the I.M.F. have continued for months and are now at the final stages, officials said.Despite the challenges, Mr. Khan insisted that the welfare program should proceed. â€œI know the economic conditions are difficult,â€ Mr. Khan said.The program would include extensive aid so that the poor could afford health care, and would include easier loan terms for families seeking to build or buy homes. The plan also includes several economic empowerment measures for women, including savings accounts and mobile phones for an estimated 5.7 million poor women.Mr. Khan has proposed a constitutional amendment that would make basic necessities such as food, housing, education and health care a fundamental right. The amendment would require the approval of Parliament.Analysts were skeptical that much of the program could be enacted. But many praised Mr. Khan for at least focusing national attention on the country's poverty.â€œIn his first address to the nation, Mr. Khan surprised many critics when he spoke at length about nutrition, child protection, education and maternal and neonatal health,â€ said Mosharraf Zaidi, a public policy analyst. â€œIn launching the Ehsas anti-poverty plan, he has given concrete shape to his longstanding human development ambitions.â€â€œWith an unprecedented shortfall in tax collection and a major new incoming I.M.F. program, the freedom to spend public funds on the poor will likely be even more curtailed,â€ Mr. Zaidi added. â€œHow P.M. Khan manages to balance between his pro-poor instincts and the shrinking wallet available to him will be crucial to the initial success of Ehsas.â€Decades before entering to office, Mr. Khan, a former cricket star who made philanthropy a central part of his public appeal, led an effort to finance and build the country's first dedicated cancer hospital, which treats poor patients for free. In his speech on Wednesday, he pointed out that at the time of its inception, no one thought the hospital campaign could work.â€œIf I had gone by logic, I would never have been able to complete this project,â€ he said, referring to the cancer hospital.â€œWhen a nation decides to help its poor, God finds ways for it to succeed. The real thing is to have honest intentions,â€ Mr. Khan said. â€œIt is my belief that, God willing, one day you will see that we would be successful in eradicating poverty.â€â€œI also want to give a modern day example of China,â€ Mr. Khan added. â€œWho would have thought 30 years ago that a country could pull 700 million people out of poverty? It has never happened in the world's history.â€During a visit to China last year, Mr. Khan had said that he was keen to emulate the Chinese example of development and was learning from its experiences.In announcing his anti-poverty plan, Mr. Khan said that by December the government would complete a new nationwide poverty survey that would help identify the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. He has announced the formation of a new ministry that would bring different social welfare programs under one umbrella.For women, who face extensive religious, social and economic barriers to advancement in Pakistan, Mr. Khan also envisioned a campaign to provide goats and hens to rural women to help with both food security and personal income sources. The plan also provides financial support to those widows who have no sources of income.Mr. Khan also said 50 percent of women would receive scholarships and education vouchers.The government, he said, â€œwill ensure that the invisible but hard work of rural women is recognized, that they have equal wages, and that domestic work is covered under legislation.â€The plan also includes a partnership with aid groups to support street children, transgender people and daily-wage workers. And it would feature new availability for cash grants and pensions, and higher government spending on education and health care.â€œThere isn't a single formula to eradicate poverty,â€ Mr. Khan said. â€œMany steps have to be taken.â€"
"Like tick-tack-toe, five-day cricket matches and Italian soccer in the 1980s, chess has a lot of draws. But the two grandmasters currently battling for the world title in London, Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, may be taking it a little too far.Eight of the 12 games in their world championship match are over. And every one of them, including Monday's Game 8, has ended in a draw.For the past week and a half, Carlsen and Caruana, the two best players in the world, have matched wits, and moves, across a table in an auditorium in hourslong games. It can all feel a bit sterile at times, with the players separated from those watching by one-way glass, and the tension broken only by the occasional scheduled rest day.From that detached vantage point, and even more distance online, the chess news media and fans have watched and analyzed the movement of each piece with excitement. And still, no one wins.Occasionally it has seemed as if someone might. In Game 1 last week there was excitement as the champion Carlsen pushed for victory, causing some to speculate that he was on his way to making quick work of Caruana, his American challenger.But after a seven-hour marathon, Caruana, who at one point had been desperately short on time, fought back and earned a draw. That result seemed to set the tone that has continued.In Game 6 on Friday, it was Caruana's turn to reach the brink of victory. He came desperately close to closing out Carlsen, only to be stymied in the last moves.After Game 7, Carlsen declared, â€œWhat I did was just way too soft.â€â€œI'm not loving it, but I'm not in any sort of panic mode either,â€ he added. â€œIt could have been worse.â€He would know: He has been here before. The 2013 championship, when Carlsen won his title, began with four draws. His first defense, in 2014, started with only one.In 2016, the last time Carlsen defended his title, the match began with seven consecutive draws. Then the challenger, Sergey Karjakin of Russia, won a game, but Carlsen came back to win one of his own before retaining his crown in a tiebreaker.Ah, yes, the tiebreaker. Monday's draw leaves four games to go in this year's match. If no one wins any of them, the players will begin an arduous run of tiebreakers on Nov. 28 in the hopes that someone will actually win a game.First, the players will face off in four games with a rapid time limit of only 25 minutes per player.Four more draws? They will next play up to 10 more games at the blinding pace of only five minutes per player — so-called blitz games.Still drawing? It's time for an Armageddon game. In it, Carlsen and Caruana would play a single game: Whoever draws white — and goes first — will get five minutes, while black will get four.If this game, too, is a draw, then the organizers will simply throw up their hands and declare black the winner of the match.Really."
"So which is it? How do you pronounce Gemini?In â€œFirst Man,â€ the new film about the Neil Armstrong and the moon landing, astronauts and NASA officials say â€œGEM-uh-knee.â€ But the first pronunciation in the Webster's New World College Dictionary Fifth Edition, the standard work used by The New York Times to settle such matters, the first pronunciation is GEM-uh-neye,â€ which is the way many of us say it. Or, to use the precise dictionary typography, jemâ€²É™ nÄ«Î„ versus jemâ€²É™nÄ“Î„.Really, though, which is right?The 10 crewed missions of the Gemini program, with capsules that carried two people into space in 1965 and 1966, never got the attention that the programs before and after it received. Mercury and the seven original astronauts had Tom Wolfe as chronicler in â€œThe Right Stuff.â€ Apollo had the triumph of the Moon landing, the tragedy of Apollo 1 and the nail-biting return of crippled Apollo 13.[Readers tell us what they remember about the moon landing]Gemini, by contrast, is the middle child of the early space program, eager to please but apt to be ignored. And when it comes to saying the name aloud, there has always been some knee-eye confusion. In this newspaper, a seemingly authoritative 1965 article tried to resolve the â€œrunning debateâ€ with a statement from NASA that the proper pronunciation is â€œâ€˜Jiminy,' as in â€˜Jiminy Cricket.'â€On Tuesday, Bob Jacobs, a spokesman for NASA, said that the â€œkneeâ€ pronunciation is part of the agency's culture, and serves almost as an insider's shibboleth — a word whose proper delivery identifies you as someone in the know. â€œIf you get it right,â€ he said, â€œyou're part of the space club.â€ He likened it to the Nashville street Demonbreun, which is pronounced Da-MUN-bree-un, and not like what some have characterized as â€œdemon pickle juice.â€ Mr. Jacobs also suggested that the pronunciation could have to do with the early space program's Southernness, in the way that â€œevery pilot speaks like Chuck Yeager.â€And yet it wasn't always so clear, said Bill Barry, the space agency's chief historian. Back in the time of the Gemini program, â€œit kind of depended who you were talking to, and what day of the week it was,â€ and even varied from NASA locations, he said.For â€œFirst Man,â€ NASA arranged a meeting between the film's star, Ryan Gosling, and Michael Collins, a member of the Apollo 11 crew. Taking the opportunity, Dr. Barry asked Mr. Collins to resolve the question. â€œHe kind of gets this twinkle in his eye,â€ he recalled. â€œHe used the word â€˜Gemini' twice in his answer — and he pronounced it both ways.â€As for the filmmakers, Dr. Barry said that he suggested to them that for the sake of clarity, they pick one pronunciation and stick with it. â€œFrom my perspective, from 50 years later, whichever you want to use is fine.â€"
"Often, when actors or directors with Oscar contenders sit down opposite your Carpetbagger, I can sense the barely concealed anxiety underneath their brave faces. There are so many year-end movies jostling for award-season attention, and it's possible that their passion projects could get lost in the scrum.It was striking, then, when I recently met up with a relaxed and grinning John Krasinski, who's treating the awards run of â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ as an unexpected victory lap. Krasinski directed and starred in the postapocalyptic horror movie about a family besieged by sound-seeking monsters, and since â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ was an out-of-the-gate hit last spring, â€œit's nice to have the pressure off and have this be a celebration than for it to be an angsty, scary time,â€ Krasinski said.[Read our review of â€œA Quiet Place.â€]In a year with many populist contenders in the mix, including â€œA Star is Bornâ€ and â€œBlack Panther,â€ the team behind â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ now hopes to convert that box-office passion into award-season heat. So far, Krasinski's wife and co-star in the film, Emily Blunt, has picked up a SAG nomination for her work, and the movie has scored top 10 mentions from organizations like the National Board of Review and American Film Institute. That means Krasinski, 39, has spent almost an entire year promoting his film, but he's happy to overextend himself. â€œI do feel wiped,â€ he told me, â€œbut it's a whole different ballgame to be talking about something you love.â€Here are edited excerpts from our conversation:Your first breakthrough was as an actor on â€œThe Office,â€ which became a hit later into its run. By contrast, â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ was an overnight phenomenon. How did you experience that kind of success?â€œThe Officeâ€ was so gradual that there was time to process it, but with â€œA Quiet Place,â€ when you're fired out of a cannon, you don't really know you're in the air until you're almost on the way down. It's changed my life completely. It felt like this was a story I had always wanted to tell, and I didn't even know it was lacking in my life, so there was this satiation from it that I didn't realize I needed. When I was walking my daughter to school for the first time after we premiered at South by Southwest, I felt like, â€œYou're getting your full dad for the first time.â€What was that first public screening like? We were driving there, and my wife said: â€œWhat do you want to worry about? Focus on one thing, because if you worry about the whole movie, you'll drive yourself crazy.â€ I remembered [George] Clooney told me that they clapped at the end of [the drama he directed] â€œGood Night and Good Luck,â€ so I said, â€œIt'd be cool if they clapped.â€ Of course, I chose the end of the movie, which was stupid. She said: â€œO.K., just focus on that. Don't worry about what the audience does until that moment.â€When Emily cocked the gun at the end of the movie, they exploded. They jumped out of their seats, they were shaking the chairs. I remember that so clearly because Emily turned to me and screamed, â€œOh my God!â€ And very apropos, I couldn't hear because everyone was so loud. That's when I knew, â€œThere's something here.â€A horror movie is not unlike a comedy in that way: If it works, people have a visceral reaction to it.It's funny you [say that] because I really did take on this project because of some advice Greg Daniels gave me when I was working on â€œThe Office.â€ He told me, â€œYour job is not to deliver these lines funny. Your job is just to deliver these lines. If people find it funny, that's up to them — you just play the honesty of it.â€That's how I approached this movie, and I don't know if I would have done this had he not given me that advice. I would have gone in thinking, â€œI've got to scare people because this is a genre film,â€ and it would have been horrible.The film is expected to be a strong Oscar contender in the two sound categories, which people often mix up. Since sound was such an important part of your movie, it strikes me that you might be the perfect person to explain the difference between those two categories.There's sound mixing and editing. The editing is getting all the sounds in place, putting this sound next to that sound. Sound mixing is making sure they all come together to sound real. If crickets were as loud as the music, it would be insane: You have to diminish the crickets to whatever it's supposed to be to feel real. That whole idea, I thought I understood until I did this movie. It can either be a tool set that will fix things, or it can be a magic kit where you blow the lid off and start concocting potions of sound. That was mind-blowing to me.At the same time, if a movie really works, it may play well even without sound — when you're watching it over someone's shoulder on a plane, for instance.The truth is that I did that exactly for the first month of editing. On the first day or two, I was going through different sounds with my editor to equalize it out, and I just said, â€œHit mute.â€ And we hit mute for what might have been five weeks. The first cut and the second cut were all done without one ounce of sound. I needed to be able to connect with these characters without anything else.When you had that silent cut, did you ever think, â€œThis could practically be a complete film on its own?â€One hundred percent, and that sounds super pretentious, but it's true. Even on silent, there was so much communication happening. I didn't think our movie would be so commercially accepted because the only other time I've seen someone do a movie with no spoken dialogue is Paul Thomas Anderson at the beginning of â€œThere Will Be Blood.â€ That first 12 to 14 minutes where Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't speak was a huge touchstone for me.Paul Thomas Anderson hosted an award-season screening for your film. That's got to be gratifying.I think I've only told my wife this, so why not say it in an interview: That was the moment that was the most surreal of all this. He emailed me and said, â€œYou need to call me,â€ and we talked on the phone and he was so specific and so honest about the movie. He's been so kind to me through my career, but we were talking like we were on an even playing field and that tripped my wires. What I love most about Paul is that he loves movies.I'll tell you a big life lesson. Paul was over at my house, I think it was my 30th birthday party, and I had just seen a movie I didn't love. I said to him over a drink, â€œIt's not a good movie,â€ and he so sweetly took me aside and said very quietly, â€œDon't say that. Don't say that it's not a good movie. If it wasn't for you, that's fine, but in our business, we've all got to support each other.â€ The movie was very artsy, and he said, â€œYou've got to support the big swing. If you put it out there that the movie's not good, they won't let us make more movies like that.â€Dude, Paul Thomas Anderson is out there on the wall for us! He's defending the value of the artistic experience. He's so good that maybe you project onto him that he's allowed to be snarky, but he's the exact opposite: He wants to love everything because that's why he got into moviemaking. And ever since then, I've never said that I hate a movie.[John Krasinski explains how he went about writing â€œA Quiet Place.â€]You're writing a sequel to â€œA Quiet Place.â€ Does it worry you that the first film was such a big hit that Paramount may treat this like the â€œPurgeâ€ franchise, cranking out new installments on a yearly basis?Totally. I can't stop them from doing that. I'm a realist, I know how the studio operates. At first, I wanted nothing to do with a sequel — I told my wife, â€œIt can never be this good again.â€ And she said, â€œOf course it won't. Take this movie, put it on a mantel so you can look at it anytime you want, and then go out and do something else.â€Paramount was asking a bunch of writers and directors what they might do with it, and to their credit, they didn't take any of those pitches because they felt a little more franchise-y. Meanwhile, I had this tiny idea that fit that world and could be exciting. Paramount asked if I would write it and I'm doing that now, but I'm still thinking about what I want to do next. If I can crack the idea, I would love to direct it again, and if I can't, I would love to give it to someone else with my fingerprints on it to make sure it's being taken care of.I know that anyone reading this will be like, â€œYeah right, art guy,â€ but I do have sort of a parental feeling about this movie, and I don't want â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ to turn into an action movie where 400 people have machine guns. Or did I give away the ending to the sequel? [Laughs.]"
"Dear Match Book,I have the privilege of leading a spirituality group for homeless women at a day shelter. As a matter of policy, we do not discuss religion — both so that nonbelievers feel welcome, and also since many believers become upset when others don't share their particular views.To start things off each time we meet we often read a poem together. Over the years we have read Kabir, Hafiz and reams and reams of Mary Oliver. We've also covered Shakespeare's Sonnet 27 and â€œPhenomenal Woman,â€ by Maya Angelou. Our selections are often nature-focused, but sometimes they address human emotions and concerns, often explicitly or implicitly about spirituality. Some are about the sacredness of silence, and all are short and beautiful.Finding appropriate poems is really tough. Can you help us out?JOAN MAXWELLWASHINGTON, D.C.Dear Joan,â€œEvery poem is rooted in imaginative awe,â€ W. H. Auden said. No matter your congregants' spiritual inclinations, the distillation of language and thought can open a path to reverence, and a few moments of peace. For some, literature is the religion. Beginning each gathering with verse offers a gesture of comfort and hope.Old SoulsYou've read work by poets from 14th-century Iran (Hafiz) and 15th-century India (Kabir); have you tried the work of the 13th-century Sufi mystic poet Rumi? â€œThe Essential Rumi,â€ translated by Coleman Barks, includes three poems in particular (among many!) — â€œTwo Kinds of Intelligence,â€ â€œSay I Am Youâ€ and â€œThe Seed Marketâ€ — in which the metaphysical and the terrestrial mingle. Then, for more ancient beauty and even more brevity, try the 17th-century haikus of Matsuo Basho collected in â€œOn Love and Barley,â€ translated by Lucien Stryk. The Japanese Zen Buddhist's lines — full of cherry blossoms and â€œplum scentâ€ and a cricket's song — offer a transcendent connection to nature that spans centuries.Inside OutTwo contemporary poets who map external landscapes while navigating internal terrain may provide just what you need to spark discussion and reflection among the women in your group: â€œI used to pretend to believe in God. Mainly, I liked so much to talk to someone in the dark.â€ The first two lines of Ada LimÃ³n's â€œMiracle Fishâ€ give you a sense of the whole of her searching, vital collection, â€œBright Dead Things.â€ There are horses and trees and birds throughout — try â€œDrift,â€ â€œLies About Sea Creaturesâ€ and the startling and powerful â€œHow to Triumph Like a Girlâ€ — as well as plenty of space for believers and agnostics to meet.Faith surfaces frequently in â€œOtherwise,â€ the new and selected work by Jane Kenyon published in 1996, the year after she died. Many of Kenyon's poems are attuned to seasons, in both nature and life. And most are grave and still, though in certain entries — notably â€œEvening Sun,â€ â€œThingsâ€ and â€œLet Evening Comeâ€ — movement and light flash from line to line.Double TakesIn much of Joy Harjo's work belief takes shape as an origin story. Both â€œOnce the World Was Perfect,â€ from her 2015 book, â€œConflict Resolution for Holy Beings,â€ and â€œRemember,â€ from 1983's â€œShe Had Some Horses,â€ reveal the ties between selfhood and the wider, wild universe.Finally, â€œBlack Nature,â€ an anthology of nature poems by black writers edited by Camille T. Dungy, is an invaluable resource that you'll want to keep close at hand. A sprinkling of Richard Wright's haikus appear throughout the book's 10 thematically organized sections, creating witty respites amid the longer verse. The book's second poem, Lucille Clifton's â€œthe earth is a living thing,â€ evokes rich, mythic images of blackness — a bear, a hawk — to convey an encompassing vision of the world. The lens narrows in Robert Hayden's chilly, holy whisper, â€œIce Storm.â€ Bracing clarity also reigns in Marilyn Nelson's â€œLast Talk With Jim Hardwick,â€ which includes the line, â€œNothing is wasted / or permanently lost / in Nature,â€ and stretches down the page in an elegant strip, as deep and direct as a homily.Yours truly, Match BookDo you need book recommendations?

"Some things Tinder dates offered me (that are not sex): jars of jam, help hanging shelves, a ride to the airport, hangover sundae with peanuts, shortcuts across Durham, Costco visits, a planning commissioner's phone number, a medical consultation, a visit to a Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit, sympathy, homemade pumpkin bread, stories about their mothers, the best swimming holes, long hugs that stay hugs. I thought online dating would be about physical need, but instead I've experienced so many small intimacies. Still about need. Almost about love. — Sarah MorrisWe were online content moderators taking down nude photos. All day, we sorted through thousands of photos and messages flagged as inappropriate on a meet-up app. We sat nearby, but our office had a strict no-talking rule, so our relationship began in silence as we sent each other funny things we found via Gchat. This led to more messaging until one day we grew tired of talking about nudes and decided to see each other naked instead. — Kristine MurawskiThroughout my hardships with obsessive-compulsive disorder, parents, boyfriends and social media celebrities have sent me on a frantic and mostly unsuccessful search for self-love. I have tried to exude self-love in its various costumes — a perfect Instagram, an overflowing social calendar, a forced smile at the office. Yet these outward expressions aren't enough in the quiet moments when worry and doubt creep in. When all seems lost during solitary train rides home, my greatest triumph is finding the courage to whisper, â€œIt's all right. I'll get through this. I love you,â€ and boarding the train again. — M.C. ConnorsI was 30 and knew I couldn't have a baby. Accompanying my pregnant friend shopping one day, I pined over a striped onesie with a crab sewn on the backside. I told her if I ever had a son, I would want him to wear it. Eight days later, I went to church and saw an infant snuggled in his grandmother's arms. He was wearing the same onesie. At the end of that day's service, the reverend announced that the baby was in need of an immediate home. Two days later, he moved into mine. Now he's 5 and my son. — Sarah MouracadeWe were in my hammock when I looked at the socks I was wearing, the ones he had lent me, and told him the words I was so scared to say: â€œI love you.â€ The hammock swayed, crickets chirped. â€œThanks,â€ he said, â€œbut I don't yet.â€ He pointed at my feet. â€œThose don't fit me. Do you want them?â€ I thought the hammock had tipped, thrown me violently out; he didn't love me, this was it. But years later, we still lie in my hammock and I still wear those socks. He was right; they are too small for his feet. — Madeleine Fawcett"
"JALALABAD, Afghanistan — A suicide bomber attacked an election rally on Tuesday in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, killing at least 14 people and once again highlighting security concerns as candidates prepare for an Oct. 20 parliamentary vote amid a raging war.The attack struck at a gathering of about 300 supporters of the candidate Nasir Mohmand in Nangarhar's Kama district. Najibullah Kamawal, the province's director of public health, said at least 43 others were wounded. Officials feared the toll could rise.Mr. Mohmand survived, but with more than two weeks until Election Day, at least other seven candidates have already been killed across Afghanistan.Nangarhar has seen a drastic increase in violence in recent years, with the emergence of the Islamic State, which has its foothold in the province, adding to insecurity caused by the Taliban. Corruption and a heavy infiltration of mafia have complicated the situation, so much so that after back-to-back suicide bombings in the provincial capital, Jalalabad, the government recently changed all senior police officials and handed control of security to the army.In a separate incident on Tuesday in the province's Bati Kot District, explosives placed in a cricket field wounded seven children, according to Attaullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the provincial governor of Nangarhar. The children were aged between 12 and 15, and the condition of two was critical, he said.The parliamentary election, delayed by three years, comes amid rising violence nationwide. Nearly half of Afghan territory is controlled or influenced by a resurgent Taliban, forcing one-third of the polling stations to remain shut on Election Day. The Islamic State continues to claim deadly attacks in urban centers.A political crisis has also clouded the electoral process ahead of the vote, with political parties and the government clashing over what the parties fear is a government attempt to commit fraud regarding the number of people registered to vote.At least four provinces showed more than 100 percent of their estimated eligible voters registering, according to data from the election commission. Despite the poor security and voter fatigue because of flawed previous elections, the commission announced that about nine million people had registered to vote.Arguments over the voter rolls set off months of disagreements among the government, political parties and the election organizing body. Finally the parties' demand that voters be verified biometrically — mostly through fingerprints — was agreed to, but only after the parties had shut down several election offices across the country.Still, whether the crisis has genuinely been averted is unclear, as some are skeptical about the technical feasibility of rolling out biometric machines across about 21,00 polling stations in just a couple of weeks.Nevertheless, 2,565 candidates, 417 of them women, are taking risks to campaign this month, putting up posters and holding rallies. A large number of the candidates are young first-timers who are campaigning to change a Parliament notorious for its corruption."
"HOBART, Tasmania — There's a special kind of easygoing pleasure in eating your way through Tasmania's capital city these days, a sense that this is the exact right place and the exact right time for maximum 2019 deliciousness.The ingredients that create that impression are numerous. Hobart's compact size makes it manageable and walkable, while its hills-cascading-into-the-river beauty makes those walks especially lovely. Its architecture, much of it constructed from hefty convict-cut stone, creates many opportunities for spaces that feel like hidy-hole secrets — small, warm rooms concealed behind hulking old facades. The invigorated arts scene, thanks mainly to the innovative Museum of Old and New Art, has inspired a thriving culture of creativity. And the still (comparatively) reasonable rents have drawn an enthusiastic group of fresh-faced chefs and restaurateurs, eager to showcase the island state's unparalleled natural bounty.This confluence of prime dining conditions has not gone unnoticed by national and international media, and I'm almost certainly not the first person to tell you that Hobart is where it's at. Critical darlings have been anointed, most notably Analeise Gregory, the chef at Franklin, who not only serves sea urchin roe draped around linguine with wild fennel, but also dives for the spiny beasts herself. I've had wonderful meals at Franklin, and at the duly lauded Templo, and delicious but slightly fraught experiences at the Agrarian Kitchen, just out of town.But the most vivid impressions — enough to jolt me out of my pleasant Hobart eating reverie and into much more interesting territory — are the meals I've had at Dier Makr.[Don't miss Besha Rodell's next column. Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter for the best of our local and global coverage.]Though the restaurant has had its fair share of attention, it is often lumped in with other exciting Hobart restaurants, the fourth or fifth spot mentioned in a pack of favorites. Still, there's something going on in this odd little establishment that's especially exciting.Dier Makr is buried in the belly of an imposing gray building; a small sign in the front hallway encourages that â€œyou're going the right way.â€ In an interior room you'll find a small collection of tables, a counter that faces the kitchen and a glassed-in wine room. â€œKitchenâ€ is a bit of a misnomer: The chef, Kobi Ruzicka, and his staff cook on a collection of hot plates and small portable grills.When he opened Dier Makr in late 2016 with Sarah Fitzsimmons, a co-owner, they lacked the money for a proper kitchen. Mr. Ruzicka does not let his improvised cooking arrangement hold him back. (Ms. Fitzsimmons recently departed the business.) There's a particular bent to Mr. Ruzicka's culinary style, a layering of related but divergent flavors that borders on profound.During my first meal at Dier Makr, more than a year ago, I was knocked sideways by a dish that presented cauliflower in various states — purÃ©ed, in steamed florets and in lightly pickled slivers — along with raclette and hazelnuts. The pungent, gooey cheese brought out the vegetal funk of the cauliflower, each element amplifying the others. All of the good things about cauliflower were put in a new light, one so much bolder than any I'd experienced before.The fixed price for a seven-course meal was $65, which seemed incredibly cheap. The owners must have come to the same conclusion: Over the last 18 months the price went up incrementally, and is now $85.What you get for that $85 continues to thrill. A recent meal began with a shallow bowl of creamy mascarpone, topped with soft diced potatoes confited in butter. Ultrathin purple potato chips came alongside, with the instruction to treat the dish as a dip. It played out like a loaded baked potato that had been reimagined and deconstructed — familiar and comforting, but elemental and original.A decent portion of the meal is dedicated to snacking, the chips and dip followed by tiny tarts of tomatillo topped with creamy kingfish brandade, then raw carrots and radishes alongside a pool of labneh topped with an umami-rich paste made from fermented crickets and charred allium.Further into the evening, a bowl of dashi appeared, dotted with mysterious dark parcels, some of which turned out to be zucchini, others dumplings made from leek and mussels. I'd expected to be wooed by the latter, but the dumpling wrappers were a little tough and clumsy. The revelation came with the zucchini, which was so soft it collapsed in on itself and revealed a plush, luxurious quality I'd never known in zucchini before.The glassed-in wine room plays a refreshingly interactive part in your meal: Rather than refer to a list, you're invited to peruse the room the way you would a wine shop. A waiter will accompany you and help as much as is needed, or you can take your time and rely on the tasting notes written on cards hung round each bottle's neck. It's not a huge collection, but it is very well chosen, showcasing the most interesting things happening in Australian winemaking alongside smaller producers from Europe.Wine has been a focus for Mr. Ruzicka and Ms. Fitzsimmons all along, and in November they opened a wine bar called Lucinda in a street-facing space in the front of the building. Lucinda's menu is, on its face, more straightforward than Dier Makr's, with dishes like mozzarella panzanela, or roast potatoes with gribiche. But here, too, Mr. Ruzicka finds ways to make you sit up and take notice: mustard greens dressed in an XO sauce that is boldly pungent with fermented seafood; pickled rhubarb on a cheese plate that sings with acidic personality.Mr. Ruzicka moved to Hobart from his hometown, Melbourne, almost on a whim; he says Dier Makr could never have come about back there. This is the promise of Hobart: that the next generation of talented chefs is able to spin its own weird and beautiful stories here without too much compromise.Thank the low rents, thank the beauty, thank the art museum, thank the amazing produce, thank the creative community that flourishes here. But however you spin it, it's Melbourne's loss.Do you have a suggestion for Besha Rodell?

"BRAMPTON, Ontario — It was supposed to be a dream family vacation.An immigrant grandfather eager to set foot on African soil after an absence of 30 years.A doting mother determined to show her Canadian daughters where she came from.Two teenage girls giddy at the prospect of seeing animals on safari in Kenya.Instead, three generations of an Indian-Canadian family perished when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, including 18 Canadians.â€œI am not angry, but I am devastated. I have lost everyone,â€ said Manant Vaidya, 41, whose parents, sister, brother-in-law and two teenage nieces all died in the crash, which had victims from 25 countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia, China and the United States.[Read our latest coverage of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.]In Brampton, Ontario, a multicultural suburban city outside Toronto where Punjabi is the second-most spoken language after English, the tight-knit South Asian community is in shock at the deaths of Mr. Vaidya's mother, Hansini Vaidya, 67; father, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73; sister Kosha Vaidya, 37; brother-in-law Prerit Dixit, 45; and two teenage nieces Ashka Dixit, 14, and Anushka Dixit, 13.They are mourning, Mr. Vaidya said, for a family that embodied the â€œCanadian dream.â€Within hours of the crash, the mayor ordered that flags at city hall be lowered to half-staff to honor the family. Flags were also lowered at the girls' schools.On Tuesday, a steady stream of neighbors and relatives dropped by the handsome house in Brampton where Mr. Vaidya and his family had lived with his parents, offering condolences and care packages of food.On Monday, Sushma Swaraj, the Indian foreign minister, called to express her condolences.The family, meanwhile, was discussing how to find hair samples or dental records of their dead relatives for DNA testing. They said they despaired at the possibility of not being to able to identify the bodies so that the family could be cremated in their native Gujarat in accordance with Hindu ritual.[Read answers to frequently asked questions about Boeing's 737 Max 8.]â€œI last saw them on Saturday morning when I dropped them off at the airport,â€ Mr. Vaidya said.A friend from Nairobi called the next day to tell him the news.â€œI couldn't believe it at first,â€ Mr. Vaidya said, adding that the family had feared breaking the news to his mother's 90-year-old mother, back in India.Mr. Vaidya said his family were typical first-generation Indian immigrants, with five groups of relatives living within five minutes of one another in Brampton, presided over by his parents.They were surrogate parents, mentors and therapists to the entire clan, he said, many of whose immediate family was in India.Pannagesh Vaidya, a gentle, soft-spoken man with a ready smile, had been chief executive of an engineering consulting business, his son said, and enjoyed tutoring his grandchildren in math, doing equations in his head.At weekly family get-togethers, overflowing with naan bread and dal, along with pizza, Ashka would sing and Anushka would do classical Indian dances. Anushka aspired to be a robotics engineer.â€œThe two girls were born here and were Canadian girls,â€ Mr. Vaidya said. â€œThe whole family believed Canada was a land of opportunity.â€Mr. Vaidya said his sister immigrated to Ontario in 2003, to join her husband, who had arrived from India in the 1990s, in search of a better life. About nine years later, her parents joined them from India.The Canadian cold had initially been a culture shock to his father, he said. â€œBut my father said better to stay indoors and be close to family.â€Hiral Vaidya, Mr. Vaidya's wife, recalled that her mother-in-law was deeply religious. Every morning she woke up to do puja, a Hindu ritual in which she paid homage to Indian deities, including the powerful Shiva.Before the Ethiopian Air flight, she said, Hansini Vaidya woke at 3 a.m. and spent two hours praying for a safe journey. â€œShe wouldn't eat or do anything until she had prayed,â€ she said.Mr. Dixit thought a lot about plane safety, Mr. Vaidya said, and, before the flight, had assiduously studied the safety record of the Boeing 737 Max 8, along with the airline's track record.He said his brother-in-law had felt confident because it was a new plane. â€œHe did his homework,â€ Mr. Vaidya said.The senior Vaidyas had met in an arranged marriage in Gujarat, but love soon took over. Mr. Vaidya said his father financed his mother's education as an architect. â€œHe was part of the older generation, but respected his wife having a career,â€ he said.The family embodied the work ethic of new immigrants.Mr. Vaidya said his brother-in-law, a passionate photographer, worked two jobs, seven days a week when he first came to Canada, including as a lab technician for the Canadian Ministry of Health.His sister, an extrovert with a zest for travel, worked in the human resources department of the Canadian Hearing Society, which provides services for deaf people.Nikita Joshi, one of her closest friends, said she was determined to travel as broadly as possible before her daughters started university.She had checked off Alaska, Mexico and Hawaii, and was eager to show her daughters Mombasa, Kenya, where she had been born when her father was working there decades earlier.After Kenya, she had planned to take the family to London to watch cricket, to India to see her family, and to Dubai.The girls swam, followed soccer, listened to girl bands and joined the family on Bollywood film nights.â€œThe closeness in their family was so nice,â€ said Ashka's music teacher, Pramesh Nandi. â€œThey were like made for each other, all four of them.â€â€œI'm not ready to believe that they are not here,â€ he added. â€œI keep thinking that someone will come here and say that they're still alive and they're enjoying the trip in Africa.â€As a succession of countries, including Germany, Britain, France, Australia and Oman, grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 planes on Tuesday, the family asked why Canada had not joined other countries in doing so.â€œSomeone needs to step up and take responsibility for this tragedy so this doesn't happen to another family, and lives are lost in the air,â€ said Premal Vyas, a relative. â€œWe have a lot of questions, but very few answers.â€"
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)Good morning. U.S. candidates deliver closing statements, Pakistan caves in to protesters, Afghan migrants take cricket to France. Here's what you need to know: â€¢ U.S. election nears.The tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign barreled through its final weekend and toward the day of decision, Tuesday.The most prominent campaigners are on opposite sides of the country's vast political divide. President Trump has been crisscrossing the country to deliver fear-based messages on immigration and other issues. Former President Barack Obama has been assailing him in a surprisingly sharp, systematic way.Our live polling has many races too close to call, but there's a consensus in both parties that Democrats could take control of the House — and that the outlook for the Senate is unclear.We have an overview of the election and scenes from around the U.S.And The Times Magazine looks at an issue shadowing the country: the rise of white nationalism and domestic terrorism, which has flummoxed law enforcement. The far-right groups thrive online and have been increasingly emboldened since Mr. Trump took office._____â€¢ Pakistan yields to protesters.Asia Bibi, a Christian woman acquitted last week of blasphemy charges and ordered freed, remains in Pakistan. Above, her three daughters.On Friday, the government made a deal to halt hard-line Islamist groups' huge protests over the Supreme Court's ruling, which had brought parts of the country to a standstill. The deal prevents Ms. Bibi from leaving the country while the case is reviewed and appealed, a process that could add years of detention to the eight she spent on death row.Over the weekend, her lawyer fled the country for his own safety._____â€¢ â€œThe biggest mistake the Hong Kong government has ever made.â€That was a legal expert, commenting on the decision last month to expel Victor Mallet, the Asia news editor of The Financial Times.His work visa was rejected without explanation weeks after he presided over an event at the Foreign Correspondents' Club with an activist who advocates independence from China, Andy Chan. Above, flags of Hong Kong and China.The move — a first for the semiautonomous territory, which long prided itself for freedom of expression — refocused attention on the independence movement, drew sharp questions from diplomats and cast a dark shadow over Hong Kong's reputation as an unfettered financial and commercial hub.The private business community shares the alarm of foreign media organizations, and some see a reason to relocate operations to Singapore._____â€¢ Ozone-depleting gas traced. An environmental group has found new evidence that rogue factories in China are behind the resurgence of a banned gas that destroys the ozone layer and contributes to global warming.The ozone layer protects the earth from ultraviolet solar radiation. After a giant hole appeared in the layer in 1985, much of the world signed on to the Montreal Protocol outlawing CFC-11, used mostly in refrigerators and air-conditioners. Without that landmark treaty, the entire ozone layer would have collapsed by 2050, according to some studies.But in May, scientists found atmospheric levels of the gas were falling more slowly than expected. A Times investigation pointed to scrappy, small-scale factories across China, findings confirmed by the new study.Chinese authorities have pledged to stamp out the illicit production, but under-the-radar producers and a lack of measuring equipment are obstacles._____â€¢ Since President Trump took office, there has been a sharp decline in financial penalties against banks and big companies accused of malpractice, a Times investigation found.â€¢ Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, bought back nearly $1 billion of its own stock during its blockbuster third quarter.â€¢ Apple's decision to limit disclosures — including how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter — and its disappointing forecast for fourth-quarter sales dragged down its stock.â€¢ The latest U.S. jobs report painted an ideal picture of the economy. But there are three factors that will determine if the hot market will last.â€¢ Coming this week: American sanctions against Iranian oil go into effect. But some of the country's biggest importers — India, South Korea, Japan and China — are said to be exempted for six months.â€¢ New York City Marathon: Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia pulled ahead late to win the men's race in 2:05:59. Mary Keitany of Kenya, above, won the women's race in 2:22:48. [The New York Times]â€¢ A truck driver in northwestern China lost control, crashing into 31 cars, killing at least 13 people and injuring more than 40. [CNN]â€¢ Also in China: Many internet users expressed fury over a video showing a woman in Chongqing attacking the driver of a bus for skipping her stop just before it plunged into the Yangtze River, killing at least 13 people. [The New York Times]â€¢ Amal Hussain, the emaciated 7-year-old Yemeni girl whose haunting portrait in The Times drew an impassioned response from readers, died, underscoring the immense human toll of the Saudi-led war. [The New York Times]â€¢ An Australian nun, Sister Patricia Fox, who criticized the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, returned home six months after he ordered her arrest and deportation. [The New York Times]â€¢ Most of Sri Lanka's lawmakers refused to recognize the prime minister abruptly appointed by the president, and some said they had been offered bribes, amid an escalating political crisis on the island nation. [The New York Times]â€¢ A man-eating tiger in India that had been blamed for the deaths of 13 people was killed after a monthslong hunt that involved drones, elephants and a bottle of cologne. [The New York Times]â€¢ Novak Djokovic lost to the Russian player Karen Khachanov in the Paris Masters tennis tournament, ending a 22-game winning streak. [ESPN]Tips for a more fulfilling life.â€¢ Recipe of the day: Pack a lunch of farro salad with beets, their greens and salty feta.â€¢ Don't be a sucker when buying a used phone.â€¢ Fix your sleep habits and schedule. Then see about some gadgets.â€¢ Afghan migrants have taken their passion for cricket to France. And it's helping them integrate with the local community.â€¢ Mickey Mouse turns 90 this year, and Disney is deploying an enormous global marketing campaign to celebrate one of its oldest characters.â€¢ In memoriam: Raymond Chow, 91, the famed Hong Kong film producer who turned Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan into international stars and transformed the action film genre.Stickers can be surprisingly motivating, even for adults.At least that's the idea behind the â€œI Votedâ€ stickers handed out on Election Day in the U.S. — that they'll encourage voters to turn out, and inspire those who see them to vote themselves. (Election Day is Tuesday.)The stickers first appeared in the 1980s, offered by businesses, unions and civic groups. State and local governments began making their own.While some states keep it simple, others take the opportunity to express their identities. Some stickers, like Alabama's, Ohio's and Tennessee's, incorporate the shape of the state. Georgia's use the state's famous peach, while California's is in 13 languages.Alaskans who voted early this year got stickers with cartoon versions of state animals. Louisiana's stickers, which feature the Cajun artist George Rodrigue's iconic â€œBlue Dog,â€ have appeared on eBay.New York City has its own subway-themed sticker. Other cities are following Chicago's lead and offering wristbands instead.The stickers have also gone online. Instagram has â€œI Votedâ€ and â€œYo VotÃ©â€ emblems, along with a â€œWe Votedâ€ story on Election Day that gathers posts by a user's friends.Do they actually make a difference?

By the time you read this briefing, the United States will have reimposed severe economic sanctions on Iran and financial penalties for those who continue to import Iranian goods. Above, Iranian rials at a currency exchange shop in Basra, Iraq.The reinstated sanctions threaten to widen a rift between the U.S. and its European allies, who have criticized President Trump for abandoning the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.But the U.S. undercut its own sanctions by granting six-month waivers to eight countries — including India, South Korea, Japan and China, among the world's largest importers of Iranian oil. The E.U. did not receive an exemption.Separately, Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, has been lobbying Washington to save his companies from Trump administration sanctions. His efforts may prove successful._____â€¢ In Germany, one of the longest dry spells on record has left part of the Rhine, above, at record-low levels for months, causing havoc for many European businesses.Around 80 percent of the cargo transported by ship in Germany travels the Rhine, which many freighters have had to stop plying. Gas stations reliant on the river for fuel delivery from the Netherlands have run dry, and a German chemical plant that uses the Rhine's water had to trim back production.Europeans are bracing for further instability, with one researcher predicting that because of a warming climate, â€œthe extremes are going to happen more often.â€Separately, an environmental group has found new evidence that rogue factories in China are behind the resurgence of the banned gas CFC-11, which destroys the ozone layer and contributes to global warming._____â€¢ Paradise or â€œDeath Islandâ€?The Thai island of Koh Tao, above, is popular with Western tourists. But at least nine European visitors have died or disappeared there since 2014, and a rape allegation by a 19-year-old British woman has raised new questions about how the police handle serious crimes against tourists.The police said they had found no evidence to support the rape allegation and arrested 12 people who had posted about it on Facebook.â€¢ McKinsey, Booz Allen Hamilton and Boston Consulting have all continued work with Saudi Arabia even as investors distance themselves after the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

"The profile of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world, may have risen when it was showcased in the Oscar-winning movie â€œSlumdog Millionaire,â€ but my tour guide didn't particularly care about that at the moment. What concerned him more was the pejorative nature of the word â€œslumâ€ and how outsiders perceived Dharavi, an area smaller than New York City's Central Park but where about a million people live and work.â€œWe don't want people to think slums are dangerous and full of lazy people,â€ said Hitesh Vaidya, a guide for Reality Tours and Travel. The reality of daily life in Dharavi is sobering, however: Laborers work in unsafe conditions, and a lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation facilities endangers the health of residents. Mr. Vaidya and I spent the next couple of hours touring the many different industries and businesses within Dharavi, which included plastics recycling, textile manufacturing and food production. I left with a better knowledge of both the poverty and industriousness of Dharavi, as well as an understanding of Mr. Vaidya's point: that the two are not mutually exclusive.Mumbai (sometimes called by its former name, Bombay) is an electric and complicated city, an extraordinary place, both uplifting and heartbreaking. Its eclectic composition of different groups and cultures makes it a difficult city to define, but for many, it's a city that represents possibility. Dharmesh Gandhi, a friend who lives in Mumbai, offered his take on India's financial center and one of the world's most populous cities: â€œIt's like New York,â€ he said. â€œEverything is happening here, so everyone wants to come here.â€ After a four-day visit this past October, it was easy to see why: The shopping and entertainment options were excellent, and opportunities for great dining were second-to-none. And while the rupees flow freely in Mumbai, I was able to keep my spending under control.A couple of logistical items: My flight, booked through Jet Airways, cost a bit over $200 for a one-way flight from Sri Lanka. As I was re-entering India, I had to produce my double-entry e-visa once more to passport control. My Uber ride from the airport was about 370 rupees, or a little more than $5. If you'd prefer not to use Uber, another popular service is Ola Cabs. I used both while in Mumbai, typically opening both apps and using whichever had a car closer to me. The ubiquitous tuk-tuk is conspicuously absent in much of Mumbai (â€œThe traffic here is bad enough,â€ Mr. Gandhi told me). In central Mumbai, you'll just see regular taxis. Fortunately, they're metered, with fares beginning at 22 rupees.I was well-located in the Fort neighborhood of the city, close to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station, the huge Victorian landmark constructed in the late 19th century. My quarters at the Hotel Residency Fort, Mumbai, booked for $52 a night on Hotels.com, were modest luxury, roomy and air-conditioned, and with free breakfast.A walk around the neighborhood was the first order of business: A stop by Mumbai's first Anglican church, St. Thomas Cathedral, established in 1718, was followed by a visit to the free Jehangir Art Gallery near Wellington Fountain. I enjoyed the Nayanaa Kanodia exhibition, â€œThe Quintessential Woman: A Celebration,â€ which featured oil paintings and drawings celebrating feminism. Another exhibition, â€œRural Beauty,â€ featured darker, more sensual pencil and pastel works by Parshuram B. Patil.There are numerous fine museums in Mumbai, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India). Admission is 500 rupees, plus an additional 50-rupee fee to take cellphone photos. The main hall of the museum, which features Rajastani temple columns and wooden railings from a nobleman's home, is topped with a great Islamic dome — a nod to Mumbai's diverse history.There are some wonderful statues of Indian deities on the ground floor — Shiva, Ganesh, Brahma and Vishnu, some dating as far back as the sixth century. I also enjoyed looking at a series of paintings from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, done in the Rajasthani Bikaner style, particularly one depicting a scene from the Mahabharata epic.My favorites, though, were probably the later work of Jehangir Sabavala, a Mumbai-born artist who died in 2011 at age 89. His paintings, which intriguingly join East with West, have elements of both Cubism and Impressionism. I particularly liked â€œThe Eye,â€ as well as his somber â€œThe Raven,â€ 2010 works that were two of Sabavala's final pieces.The most interesting museum I visited, however, proved to be the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum, which claims to be Mumbai's very first, established in 1872 (100 rupees admission). The building itself is quite beautiful, and houses interesting artifacts like old model ships, ganjifa — round playing cards that became popular under Mughal emperors in the 16th century — and examples of pottery from the Sir J.J. School of Art near the turn of the 20th century. Particularly interesting was an exhibition documenting the movement of peoples to Mumbai over the years, from the Kolis fishermen of Gujarat in the 13th century to the Parsi, Surati and Khoja people that immigrated with the rise of the East India Company.But it's not just the past that impresses in Mumbai — the present is pretty happening, too. I headed to the club the Quarter one evening to catch a show with Azamaan Hoyvoy and his pseudo-funk trio (750 rupees for a standing ticket). They grooved through a number of pretty good covers, including â€œHow Deep Is Your Loveâ€ and Allen Stone's â€œUnaware.â€ Cocktails at the Quarter run in the 600 rupee range, but you can get a Kingfisher beer for 275.I spent another evening at Shanmukhananda Hall, a large auditorium near the King's Circle train station, to take in a Lucky Ali concert (1,500 rupees, purchased through the website Book My Show). Lucky Ali, a Mumbai-born musician, went through crowd-pleasing soft rock favorites with a six-piece band. Between numbers, he took the opportunity to speak on various issues. â€œIf Ganga goes, where do we go?â€ he asked, referring to the Ganges River. â€œI think half of you probably haven't even been there. Go there! Plant some trees or something.â€About two-and-a-half miles to the southwest is Siddhi Vinayak Mandir, a beautiful temple dedicated to Ganesha and an essential place of worship for many Mumbai Hindus. I arrived just in time one evening for a puja, and after leaving my shoes at a counter outside, was ushered in to the sound of clapping, drums, bells and the smell of incense. A small, serene-looking Ganesha statue sat among orange and white flowers while a group of about 150 of us stood engaged in an intense, rhythmic call-and-response that changed tempos and melodies throughout the course of the next 30 minutes. For those looking to worship in a hurry, a â€œquick darshanâ€ line can be entered for a payment of 50 rupees.Any explorer of Mumbai will eventually need to try one of thousands of street vendors and restaurants that grace the city. Fortunately, there is no shortage of good options, and nearly every price point is covered. The Bombay street sandwich is one you'll see everywhere and, if you're feeling adventurous, certainly worth trying. A typical example features sliced cucumber, potato, onion, tomato and beetroot on toasted bread, served with a variety of spicy chutneys. At 25 or 30 rupees, it's an absolute steal.Mumbai's reputation for street food par excellence is well deserved, and on Sheikh Memon Street, near the Juma Masjid mosque, I indulged in another treat: a plate of dahi puri (40 rupees), savory chickpeas stuffed into flaky puri shells, drenched in tart yogurt and dusted with spices and herbs. And no Mumbai street food discussion is complete without mentioning vada pav, the quintessential carbohydrate bomb that features a fried potato fritter squished into soft white roll (about 10 rupees, and it can be found all over).The city does upscale dining with equal aplomb. Prateek Sadhu and Aditi Dugar own Masque, an elegantly repurposed industrial space that serves a 10-course tasting menu every day except Monday. The wine pairing alone, however, costs 6,000 rupees — it's not exactly a place for penny-pinchers. Fortunately, Masque offers a bar menu for walk-ins like me looking for a lighter meal.A very good sour eggplant toast (350 rupees), sweetened with tamarind and covered with caramelized onions, functioned as a kind of tangy eggplant pÃ¢tÃ©. A twist on pani puri, the classic street food, filled the thin shells with a cactus salad and corn mousse (350 rupees). Something described as pork okonomiyaki (500 rupees) really was like a sweet-glazed pork taco, competently prepared and served with a nice cabbage slaw. My server, Ayush, was particularly good and made me feel right at home.Somewhere in the middle, you've got Gurukripa, an all-day casual vegetarian restaurant in the Sion neighborhood. There's an exceptionally good pav bhaji (96 rupees), a tomato-y mash of spiced vegetables served with a slab of rapidly melting butter. White rolls, crunchy papadum and a sharp onion salad round out the meal. Or there's Ling's Pavilion, a Mumbai institution, where the steamed pork with salted fish (500 rupees) and creamy fried corn curd (275 rupees) will help explain the country's love of Chinese food.And don't forget the shopping. At the excellent Kitab Khana bookstore, I perused the sizable section entitled â€œBooks on Gandhi and by Gandhiâ€ before settling on Mohandas K. Gandhi's autobiography, â€œThe Story of My Experiments with Truth,â€ for just 156 rupees. Another day, I set out in search of spices and ended up at Lalbaugh Market near Chinchpokli Station. Wandering down Dinshaw Petit Road, I followed the sound of loud, metallic pounding until I ended up at Vishwas, a specialty spice store where a shopkeeper was in the process of mashing a red substance into fine powder. I asked for haldi, or turmeric, and the man behind the counter spooned a 200-gram plastic bagful for 60 rupees.But the best way to get a feel for the city might be to walk along Fashion Street on a weekend afternoon. Fashion Street is on the western edge of Fort, along Mahatma Gandhi Road, flanking a big public park, Azad Maidan, and branching off into Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Road to the south. On the street, packed solid with shoppers, are hundreds of stalls containing anything you could possibly want to wear — dresses, T-shirts, jeans and accessories.I picked up a shirt for 250 rupees and, after a bit of haggling over the initial ask of 1,000, walked away with a pair of jeans for 600 rupees. Satisfied with my haul, I walked through the Karnatak Sports Ground, where organized teams were playing games of cricket. As the sun began to set, I crossed the street to Azad Maidan, past food vendors selling snacks and couples lounging on the grass while groups of boys played decidedly more casual pickup cricket games with tennis balls.Over a good dinner at the Parsi restaurant Ideal Corner, I reflected on my time in a city that has so much to offer — too much for one trip, certainly. Some trips are draining, but Mumbai left me feeling energized. I would have to return again to this dynamic city, and soon."
"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion.April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season.â€œThat's amazing, isn't it?â€ Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final.But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke.Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia's 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup.Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women's season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami.There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men's doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas.The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday's victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.â€œIf you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,â€ Bob Bryan said.Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova.Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak.But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women's tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980.Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors â€œweâ€ and â€œteamâ€ more than â€œIâ€ when discussing her rise.)Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday's final.But it is Barty's tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed.Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova's six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova's 66 percent.Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace.Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women's tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm.â€œI have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,â€ Barty said. â€œIt's always about trying to neutralize what your opponent's doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women's tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women's side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points.â€She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova's flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential.â€œI think I was an average cricketer, and I'm becoming a better tennis player,â€ she said. â€œIt was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling.â€So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige.Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well."
"The morning of my wedding, I woke up looking grotesque.I could hardly open my eyes because my eyelids were so swollen. In despair, I called out to Damian, my soon-to-be-husband. Then we called my doctor, who said, â€œLooks like your bone marrow transplant came to your wedding.â€I had received a bone-marrow transplant several years earlier, which vanquished the leukemia in my blood and saved my life. But my new immune system sometimes went haywire. Submerging myself in the hotel bathtub the night before with a moist, fragrant washcloth over my eyes had probably been a bad idea; it likely vexed my sensitive system.Or maybe this was caused by stress? It hurt to look at myself. Why did my body have to go rogue today of all days?Just two and a half years before, I didn't think this day would happen. At lunch with my mother, I said, â€œMom, I'm probably not going to find a partner.â€ I was 30 then and full-body irradiation had made me infertile. â€œI'm not what guys are looking for.â€I wasn't sad about this. On the contrary, I felt relieved. Finally free from hope and longing. But my mother couldn't stop crying.â€œI'm going to be O.K.,â€ I said.The next day I boarded a plane for Arkansas and a Buddhist retreat center in the Ozark Mountains I had been to before. When I was ill, my parents worried I wasn't turning to Jesus, but Buddhism seemed to make more sense. My life had become an immersive education in impermanence and suffering.After releasing the pressure of needing to partner, after making my mother cry, I arrived at the retreat center. And there was Damian, wearing tan cargo pants, a beige button-down shirt and a Tilley hat. He looked Australian, but I knew he was British.I knew because I had heard about him during a previous visit, when I met his then-wife, Angela. Damian's green card had expired and he was stuck in England, unaware that Angela was lusting after a new guy. I actually advised her to ditch the new guy and stay with her husband, because he sounded so awesome. I even emailed her afterward to encourage her again, and I was sad when I learned they had divorced.â€œSo, you're the Damian I've heard so much about,â€ I said.With a new green card, he was there for the same retreat and was helping build cabins for the center. I knew from Angela that he was in his late 40s, but he looked closer to my age.Damian would later say that after he met me, he kept thinking, â€œWhere's Ibby?â€ I did get the sense he was always finding me around the center, but not in a creepy way — more how a Labrador greets you at the door, tail wagging, ready to receive you.I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle rugged conditions, so I chose to camp the first night, but I didn't know how to set up my borrowed tent, so Damian set it up with me.As I organized my things, Damian lay half in the tent staring at the stars. He later told me he kept thinking he should leave, but he felt remarkably comfortable. I kept thinking he should stay, because I was afraid to camp alone. But I decided that sharing a tent with a stranger wasn't the best way to start a meditation retreat.And this was a silent retreat, or meant to be. The first day, I was eating lunch on the ledge of a cabin. With no room next to me, Damian plopped himself on the grass directly in front, grinning. I found the obviousness of his interest refreshing, but I couldn't say anything, so I stood up and moved next to him on the grass and we ate our lunch quietly, staring at a cabin wall.The second day, eating lunch under a tree, we watched a cricket jump onto another cricket and they started mating. Talk about an awkward silence!We went for a walk to a swimming hole, where we skipped rocks. Then I broke the silence. I had been sick, I told him, and I didn't want to waste my time or his, so I asked him every question I could think of. Do you like your mother? What about children? Cats or dogs? Would you get married again? Do you mind that my ovaries don't work?All those questions, and not one red flag.Damian wasn't fazed by my cancer-survivor status either. I was healthy by then, with a negligible chance of relapse, but my immune system could be wonky. I have already been through menopause, and I can no longer make tears — all side effects of the treatment that gave me more time on earth.Illness changes you in nonphysical ways too, aging your spirit. It can make you wiser but also more aware and scared of life's potential for pain.â€œWell,â€ Damian said, â€œyou seem fearless to me.â€On the third day, he kissed me. Then he told me he loved me.â€œNo, it's too soon!â€ I said. Then I remembered the meditation instructor told us to â€œbe spacious.â€ Maybe that meant, don't freak out?What I wanted was a man I could admire and a love that was abundantly clear. Damian was unafraid, attentive, generous and compassionate. It seemed as soon as I had let go of my hope and longing, he appeared.By the end of the retreat, I knew that while there had been life before Damian, now there could only be life with him.My parents, however, were not happy when I told them about him and us, concerned about our age difference and Damian's previous marriage.My father, an attorney, said, â€œWhen one of my clients wants to marry a divorced man, I tell her to talk to the ex-wife first.â€â€œBut Dad, I did that.â€He also worried that Damian, who designs, builds and remodels homes, wasn't a college graduate. I had an answer for this too.The year Damian was sorting out his green card, the BBC interviewed him for a story about the benefits of meditation. Because he had meditated for more than 10,000 hours, neurologists figured his brain activity might look different from the brain of an average person, so they put him into an M.R.I. machine.â€œMeet Damian, a man who can seemingly turn happiness on,â€ the reporter, David Sillito, said, adding that the neurologist who read Damian's M.R.I. had called his brain â€œbeautiful.â€ I sent the link to my father.â€œNo one's ever said that about my brain,â€ he replied.But the morning of our wedding, not even Damian could turn on my happiness. I had become Buddhist, found the retreat center and met the man I love because I once had cancer. Still, if ever there was a day that I didn't want to be reminded of this, it was today, and it was staring me in the face.My doctor prescribed antibiotics, Benadryl and steroids. Damian and I sat on the edge of the bed and meditated for an hour, which was our practice at the time. Then he went off with his best man and I tried to pull myself together. At the salon, as my hair was being twisted into a bun, my mother begged me to stop being so upset, saying it would only make my eyes worse.Damian says that my family, which is prone to stress-induced squabbles, didn't have a chance to fight that day because my eyelids elicited such sympathy. That's a very Buddhist interpretation. All I can say is I wish my eyelids had asked permission before sacrificing themselves to keep the peace.But later, as my mother and sister and sister-in-law helped me into my wedding gown, I looked in the mirror and thought, â€œWow, I actually look pretty.â€ One — or all three — of the drugs had worked. The swelling had left in its wake a burnt orange color that looked like makeup on my eyelids.Still, I didn't really arrive to my own wedding day until the doors to the chapel opened and I saw my niece dropping petals on the path I was about to walk. Everyone I love was there, staring at me, smiling. Some were crying. I just kept walking.We had a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony in a glass and wooden chapel in the woods of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. We included a Bible reading about love, since our families are Catholic, but most of the ceremony was in Tibetan: chants sung by a monk, accompanied by the ringing of a bell. Damian and I sat together silently, soaking it all in, as I experienced firsthand how suffering can transform into something beautiful."
"The greatest bowling scene in American literature, worth slipping on a pair of tricolor slippers to read, is almost certainly the one that opens William Kennedy's novel â€œBilly Phelan's Greatest Gameâ€ (1978).Kennedy's prose has as much mustard on it as does one of Billy's throws. A substantial bet has been placed. Billy bowls a strike, and it's â€œnot just another strike, but a titanic blast this time which sent all pins flying pitward, the cleanest of clean hits, perfection unto tidiness, bespeaking power battening on power, control escalating.â€Why there isn't more bowling writing in our fiction is a mystery. Surely the problem can't be the game's relatively low status. (Paul Fussell once proposed a map of the least classy places to live in America, based on ample access to bowling.) Bowling alleys seem a potent setting for drama; a playwright could set a wax-floor update of â€œThe Iceman Comethâ€ on Lane 11.Elizabeth McCracken's new novel, â€œBowlaway,â€ is a paean to candlepin bowling, a less-whacking variant of the sport. It employs thinner pins and a ball the size of a grapefruit with no finger holes. Bowlers are given three tosses a turn, not two. The game is popular in New England. There are no candlepin alleys in New York City.With this novel McCracken has, to borrow a term from cricket, bowled a googly. â€œBowlawayâ€ is a large and caterwauling sort of opera buffa, packed with outsize characters — some with recherchÃ© talents — and wild, often dreamlike events. If this novel were a bar, it would be the kind of joint where the Christmas lights are left on all year long.This is McCracken's third novel, and there's been a wait for it. (She has also written two books of stories and a memoir.) Her last novel, â€œNiagara Falls All Over Again,â€ which tracks a pair of comedy partners from vaudeville to Hollywood, appeared 18 years ago.Her first, a favorite of mine, a little heartbreaker of a book written with command and magic, is titled â€œThe Giant's House.â€ It was published in 1996. It's about a librarian and her love for a very tall, very literate boy who is dying. It's the sort of novel, I recall writing at the time, you want to sleep with under your pillow.In the nearly two decades between her last novel and this one, there has been some tragedy in the author's life. Her memoir, â€œAn Exact Replica of a Figment of My Imaginationâ€ (2008), is about the child she lost, in her ninth month of pregnancy, while living in a remote part of France.Some of the sorrow in that memoir seeps over into â€œBowlaway.â€ More than one woman in this novel has lost a child. The writing on this topic makes for close to unbearable reading.â€œPeople, women especially, are leery of mothers of dead children, or too gentle around them,â€ McCracken writes. â€œThe bereaved mother is a combustible gas, the baby is a match; which one is dangerous makes no difference but best keep them apart. LuEtta couldn't think of a way to ask that didn't make her seem more dangerous. She saw she might never be allowed to hold anyone's baby again.â€This substrata of despondency adds ballast to a novel that sometimes seems to want to drift off, like a hot-air balloon, into an ionospheric layer of pure twinkle and whimsy.This is the sort of novel in which nearly every character has an offbeat name (Leviticus Sprague, Cracker Graham, LuEtta Mood) and can seem more like a collection of quirks than a human being. One man blinks like a circus bear and has hands as brown as paws. Another speaks â€œat the same rumbling pitch of the rolling balls.â€A woman talks about rivers of blood if you ask her about cheese soufflÃ©s. Another compulsively takes in wild animals until one finally kills her. Yet another can remember being born. (â€œIt was dark inside Mama.â€) If someone showed up with an emotional support anteater, he or she would not seem out of place.In the manner of John Irving and Salman Rushdie and Annie Proulx in their less persuasive work, McCracken in â€œBowlawayâ€ comes close to writing caricatures instead of characters.That this ambitious novel nearly works is a testament to her considerable gifts as a novelist, her instinctive access to the most intricate threads of human thought and feeling.â€œBowlawayâ€ begins at the start of the 20th century, when a woman named Bertha Truitt turns up — inexplicably, as if she has beamed down from outer space — in the cemetery of a small town north of Boston.Bertha is larger than life in many ways. She's big and bosomy, which is worth remarking because so many of the people in this novel, men and women, have had too much cake and too little exercise. McCracken writes wonderfully and perceptively about large bodies. If she were a painter or sculptor, she'd be Fernando Botero or Henry Moore, not Modigliani or El Greco.Bertha, who is described as a â€œprophet of bowling,â€ opens a candlepin alley. The place is a success, in part because of its feminist bona fides. In most bowling alleys at the time, McCracken writes, women had to bowl behind curtains, separated from the men for modesty's sake. Not here.Women bowling in the open bring gawkers, â€œbecause where else could you see such a good-looking girl dewy with sweat and happiness, and not pay a cent, and not have to go to confession?â€This candlepin alley attracts ghosts. A major character spontaneously combusts. Another dies in the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, which is a correlative, at times, for the experience of reading â€œBowlaway.â€The alley attracts orphans and sensitive, damaged souls, the heartbroken and the disinherited. As this novel moves through the decades we follow them, as well as the children of Bertha and others. Some go to New York City. Others go to wars. Some open their own bowling alleys.The plot has many resonances but never fully sets its hooks in us. The politics of nearly all its characters, with respect to feminism, interracial marriage, and gay and lesbian tendencies, are anachronistically progressive.This novel's cast grows epic, but McCracken is always most impressive when she works small, when she is describing movie kisses or corsets or simply loneliness and longing.One man in â€œBowlawayâ€ likes drinking for the same reason I like her sentences: â€œBeer turned on the lights, warmed the furniture.â€"
"For various reasons — we're fighting colds, Times Square is stumbling through the usual post-holiday blahs, our colleagues in the Travel section just unveiled their latest sumptuous list of 52 places to visit — we've got globe-trotting on the mind this week. If you do too, might we recommend some short stories from Argentina? Or a new bayou murder mystery from James Lee Burke? A novel about Somali immigrants in Norway, or a collection of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's precise character studies of expats and emigrants? You'll find all of those below, along with Paul Collier's nonfiction book about retaining a sense of community in a globalized world. Closer to home, we offer a couple of food memoirs, and a natural history of the domestic biome that may have you urgently planning your next vacation to a technologically engineered cleanroom facility with a protective suit and a book. The cleanroom would be a mistake, our review makes clear. But a book is always a good idea.Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksMOUTHFUL OF BIRDS: Stories, by Samanta Schweblin. Translated by Megan McDowell. (Riverhead, $26.) This collection by the Argentine writer Samanta Schweblin, among the most acclaimed Spanish-language writers of her generation, has the surrealist echoes of her contemporaries Kelly Link and Jesse Ball. â€œBut, to me, her true ancestor could only be David Lynch; her tales are woven out of dread, doubles and confident loose ends,â€ our critic Parul Sehgal writes. â€œHer stories are obsessed with notions of purity and danger; with the ways people can be deformed, very early on, in the name of tenderness, teaching and care.â€THE NEW IBERIA BLUES, by James Lee Burke. (Simon & Schuster, $27.99.) In the latest Dave Robicheaux mystery, Burke's lawman hero contends with multiple visitors to his Louisiana bayou parish: a murderer fleeing prison; a Hollywood director returning to his roots for a movie; a woman nailed to a wooden cross that washes up from the bay. It's brutal and chaotic, but engrossing. â€œDoes anyone really read Burke expecting a coherent narrative? We're hanging on for Robicheaux's pensÃ©es,â€ Marilyn Stasio writes in her crime column. â€œWe're keeping an eye out for vivid characters. â€¦ Maybe most of all, we're waiting for those angry outbursts when Robicheaux lets it rip.â€NORTH OF DAWN, by Nuruddin Farah. (Riverhead, $27.) The war between the middle-aged Somali couple in Farah's new novel, set in middle-class Norway, is a proxy for the global clash between fundamentalism and secularism. â€œIn the hands of a younger, brasher novelist, we might expect high drama, but here, instead, is a nuanced, quietly devastating family soap opera,â€ our reviewer, Melanie Finn, writes. Farah â€œuses the intimate as allegory for the national. If we cannot understand why a family falls apart, then neither can we understand why a nation does — a truth those of us weary from holiday-dinner-table political arguments may appreciate.â€THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM: Facing the New Anxieties, by Paul Collier. (Harper/HarperCollins, $29.99.) Collier, who has devoted his career to the uplift of the global poor, argues that national loyalty is a firmer foundation for global justice than abstract cosmopolitanism, which too often masks unrestricted selfishness. â€œHow does Collier intend to repair the bonds of affection in the rich democracies? â€˜The Future of Capitalism' is rife with inventive proposals,â€ Reihan Salam writes in his review. â€œThough I wouldn't endorse Collier's manifesto in every detail, his â€˜hard centrism' has much to offer.â€AT THE END OF THE CENTURY: The Stories of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. (Counterpoint, $26.) A posthumous collection from the novelist and screenwriter best known for her precise accounts of individuals caught between different societies, seeking to find an elusive sense of home. â€œHer work anticipates a world of displaced people,â€ Megan O'Grady notes in her review, â€œwhere, as the half-British, half-Indian narrator of one of her stories puts it, everyone is â€˜moving more freely' as â€˜refugees or emigrants or just out of restless curiosity' and where there are â€˜at least two generations of people in whom several kinds of heritage are combined.' â€¦ The stories — all of them elegantly plotted and unsentimental, with an addictive, told-over-tea quality — are largely character studies of people isolated, often tragically, by custom or self-delusion.â€NEVER HOME ALONE: From Microbes to Millipedes, Camel Crickets, and Honeybees, the Natural History of Where We Live, by Rob Dunn. (Basic, $30.) Dunn has been involved in an obsessive quest to document the tiny inhabitants of indoor environments. News from the showerhead biome is just one part of this fact-filled, occasionally disgusting, slightly alarming book. â€œThere's a real sense of â€˜gee-whiz' in this book,â€ our reviewer, Robin Marantz Henig, writes, â€œbut it's mostly in service of Dunn's overarching goal: to preach the preservation of biodiversity, not only in the lush forests and streams that fit our traditional image of nature's abundance, but in the most humble places, too, where the vast majority of us will have most of our cross-species encounters — our basements, mattresses, refrigerator drawers and showerheads.â€THE BREAD AND THE KNIFE: A Life in 26 Bites, by Dawn Drzal. (Arcade, $19.99.) In this alphabet of autobiographical, gastronomical essays, Drzal traces the delicate emotions packed into a scene with the precision of a miniaturist. Irina Dumitrescu reviews the book alongside two other food memoirs. â€œWhile food provides the hooks for Drzal's memories, the collection thrums for other reasons,â€ Dumitrescu writes: â€œher moments of unflinching but forgiving self-criticism, descriptions of place that transport readers with a minimum of detail, and a knack for metaphors so perfect as to seem inevitable.â€KITCHEN YARNS: Notes on Life, Love, and Food, by Ann Hood. (Norton, $24.95.) A novelist offers meditations on food and life, served with the easy intimacy of a friend. â€œHood's essays are like hot chocolate, cozy and warm,â€ Irina Dumitrescu writes in her review. â€œHer collection of meditations on food and life touches the big themes: grief for a brother and a small child gone suddenly, two divorces and the end of a grand affair. â€¦ The recipes closing each chapter hint that every heartache can be soothed by the deft application of cheese and carbohydrates.â€"
"[For the latest updates on the Christchurch attack, read our Saturday live briefing.]â€¢ Forty-nine people were killed in shootings at two mosques in central Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a terrorist attack that appeared to have been carried out by a white nationalist extremist who posted a racist manifesto online and streamed live video of the attacks on Facebook.â€¢ After visiting victims and their families Saturday afternoon, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said many of the people who died in the attacks were the breadwinners in their families, and that the government would help those who had been left without income.â€¢ A 28-year-old man from Australia was charged with murder and appeared Saturday morning in a Christchurch courtroom. Court papers identified him as Brenton Harrison Tarrant. The New Zealand police said he would face additional charges. A second man, 18, was charged with â€œintent to excite hostility or ill-will.â€â€¢ Though officials have not released the names of those killed, a list of those missing has been published by the New Zealand Red Cross on its website. It includes people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Jordan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[How to help the victims of the Christchurch shootings.]The attacker targeted the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city and Linwood Mosque, about three miles away.The country's police commissioner, Mike Bush, said at a Friday evening news conference that 41 people had been killed at Al Noor Mosque and seven at Linwood Mosque, and that another victim had died at Christchurch Hospital.David Meates, the chief executive of the Canterbury District Health Board, said that 48 people, including young children, were treated for injuries at the hospital. Mr. Bush said Saturday morning that two of the victims were in critical condition.The police said Friday that three men and one woman had been taken into custody, but Mr. Bush lowered the total number to three on Saturday morning, indicating that someone had been released.Ms. Ardern said none of those detained had been on security watch lists.Mr. Bush had earlier urged people not to go to mosques anywhere in New Zealand on Friday. He also urged mosques nationally to â€œclose your doors until you hear from us again.â€In a Christchurch courtroom hearing closed to the public for security reasons, police officers in bulletproof vests brought in the suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant. The police said he had been charged with one count of murder but would face additional charges. Mr. Tarrant, 28, short with thinning brown hair, handcuffed and wearing white prison clothing, looked around the courtroom but said nothing as District Court Judge Paul Kellar ordered him held for a further hearing on April 5.Regional officials have said Mr. Tarrant is an Australian citizen. Court papers listed his New Zealand address as Dunedin City, which is about 280 miles south of Christchurch.Richard Peters, his court-appointed lawyer, said Mr. Tarrant had indicated he might represent himself in the prosecution. Asked how Mr. Tarrant had reacted to what he is facing, Mr. Peters said, â€œHe seemed to be quite aware of where he is and what he's doing.â€At the same time the charging document for Mr. Tarrant was handed out to reporters, a second court filing was distributed that said Daniel John Burrough, 18, of Christchurch, had been charged with â€œintent to excite hostility or ill-will.â€ Court officials would not elaborate on how the two cases were related.In addition to Mr. Tarrant, three other people were arrested in connection with the attacks, although one was apparently released. Few details have been offered about them.Families are mourning loved ones, and the city of Christchurch is preparing to bury its dead. As news trickles out about the victims of the massacre, their nationalities are beginning to emerge.Though officials have not released the names of those killed, a list of those missing has been published by the New Zealand Red Cross on its website. It includes people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Jordan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.At least three people from Bangladesh were killed, and another two from Jordan, according to local news reports. Five people from Pakistan are missing, and several others were injured, officials in Pakistan confirmed. Other foreign ministries around the world said their citizens were caught up in the attack, including three people from Turkey.A 17-minute video posted to Facebook shows part of the attack.The clip, which appeared to have been taken from a helmet camera worn by the gunman, begins behind the wheel of a car. A man, whose face can occasionally be seen in the rearview mirror, drives through the streets of Christchurch before pulling up in front of Al Noor Mosque, beside the sprawling Hagley Park.[Read more here about the video, manifesto and social media posts.]He approaches the mosque on foot, his weapon visible, and begins shooting at people at the entrance. What follows is a harrowing nearly two minutes of his firing on worshipers.At one point the gunman exits the mosque and fires in both directions down the sidewalk before returning to his car for another gun — which, like the others, was inscribed with numbers, symbols or messages. When he re-enters the mosque, he shoots several bodies at close range.After another few minutes, he returns to his vehicle and drives away.â€œThere wasn't even time to aim, there was so many targets,â€ he says at one point, as the sirens of an emergency response vehicle blare in the background.Before the shooting, the gunman posted links to a white nationalist manifesto on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for extremist right-wing discussions. The 8chan post included a link to the gunman's Facebook page, where he said he would also broadcast live video of the attack.The Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.In his manifesto, he identified himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia, and listed his white nationalist heroes.Writing that he had purposely used guns to stir discord in the United States over the Second Amendment's provision on the right to bear arms, he also declared himself a fascist. â€œFor once, the person that will be called a fascist, is an actual fascist,â€ he wrote.Many of the people who died in the attacks were the breadwinners in their family, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Saturday.The victims were â€œpredominantly from the ages of 20 to 60ish — and a large number of men,â€ Ms. Ardern told reporters at Hagley College, a local school near the hospital where relatives of the victims were gathering.She said a government compensation system would help families of those left without income. In the meantime, mosques would continue to get extra security, she added.â€œThe commissioner has advised that police security will continue at mosques around New Zealand until it is determined that it is no longer a threat,â€ she said, referring to the country's police commissioner, Mike Bush.Earlier in the day, Ms. Ardern vowed changes to the country's gun laws. She said that the attacker held a gun license obtained last November and that five guns were used in the attack, including two semi-automatic weapons.â€œOur gun laws will change, now is the time,â€ Ms. Ardern said, though did not elaborate on what such legislation may look like. â€œPeople will be seeking change, and I am committed to that.â€President Trump, who was mentioned in the suspected assailant's manifesto as a source of inspiration, rejected suggestions that white nationalism is a rising menace, although he suggested it might be problem in New Zealand.â€œI think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,â€ he told reporters in Washington in response to a question. â€œIf you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet. But it's certainly a terrible thing.â€Asked if he had seen the manifesto, Mr. Trump said: â€œI did not see it, but I think it's a horrible event, it's a horrible thing. I saw it early in the morning when I looked at what was happening, and we spoke, as you know, to the prime minister. I think it's a horrible disgraceful thing, horrible act.â€Attacks on mosques and Muslim religious leaders in the West have increased in recent years, according to data from the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland. North America, Europe and Oceania saw 128 such attacks from 2010 through 2017, the latest year of available data.Terrorist attacks on other religious institutions, such as churches and synagogues, totaled 213 over the same period.Felix Kjellberg, a polarizing YouTube celebrity known as PewDiePie, distanced himself from the attacks after the man who filmed himself shooting victims at a mosque encouraged viewers to â€œsubscribe to PewDiePieâ€ in a video livestream.â€œI feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person,â€ Mr. Kjellberg, a Swede, said on Twitter.Mr. Kjellberg has courted controversy by performing anti-Semitic gestures, which he calls satirical, in his videos. He has a following of 89 million subscribers.Over the last 18 months, tech companies have promised stronger safeguards to ensure that violent content is not distributed through their sites. But those new safeguards were not enough to stop the posting of a video and manifesto believed related to Friday's shooting.A 17-minute video that included graphic footage apparently of the shooting could be found on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram more than an hour after being posted. While Facebook and Twitter took down pages thought to be linked to the gunman, the posted content was spread rapidly through other accounts.In order to evade detection, people appeared to be cropping the video or posting the text of the manifesto as an image — techniques used to evade automated systems that find and delete content.Social media companies have heavily invested in those systems, with Facebook reporting last year that more than 99 percent of terrorism content by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda was found and removed through artificial intelligence.A Facebook spokeswoman offered condolences to the victims and said the company was â€œremoving any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware.â€YouTube said it had taken down thousands of videos related to the shooting, and asked users to help flag videos. A spokeswoman for Reddit said it was also trying to remove â€œany content containing links to the video stream or the manifesto.â€Still, the tech companies were sharply criticized by Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic candidate for president, who said in New Hampshire on Friday that it was â€œunacceptableâ€ for the companies to give â€œa platform to hate.â€Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, said the country's Muslims were anxious for updates.[For Muslims in New Zealand and abroad, the massacre has drawn outrage as a brazen act of hatred borne of anti-Muslim sentiment.]Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from the rest of New Zealand's Muslims to arrange 49 funerals.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said that three Turkish citizens were wounded in the attack; the Palestine Liberation Organization's ambassador to New Zealand said at least one Palestinian was killed; and the group Syrian Solidarity New Zealand said on its Facebook page that â€œSyrian refugees, including children, have been shot today.â€A site managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross listed dozens of people who had been recorded as missing, including people from Egypt, Syria, India, Kuwait, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia.Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, urged all Muslims to attend Friday Prayers and exhorted people of all faiths to join them to repudiate the white supremacist message of the New Zealand attack.â€œI know there was a call for people to not go,â€ she told reporters after addressing a climate rally in Washington. â€œBut I said to people that is what the terrorists want us to do. That is a win for them, and so we must face the hate and terror with love and with compassion.â€Ms. Omar also said â€œeveryone should join us in solidarity.â€The New Zealand police force had called for mosques in the country to close.The congresswoman, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, has been at the center of a political tempest in the Democratic Party over remarks on Israel that critics have called anti-Semitic. She has apologized for those remarks.Members of the Bangladesh national cricket team, in Christchurch for a match against New Zealand, were en route to Al Noor Mosque for Friday Prayer when the shooting began. They narrowly missed it.Mohammad Isam, a journalist covering the team, reported for ESPN that at 1:52 p.m. he got a call from Tamim Iqbal Khan, one of the players.â€œThere's shooting here, please save us,â€ Mr. Khan said, according to Mr. Isam. At first, he thought it was a prank.â€œBut he hangs up and calls again — this time, his voice starts to crack,â€ Mr. Isam wrote. â€œHe says that I should call the police as there's a shooting going on inside the mosque where they are about to enter.â€Mr. Isam ran toward the mosque and saw bloodied and dazed people fleeing. In the chaos, he managed to find several players, and they eventually reconvened at the hotel. The team manager, Khaled Mashud, told reporters that players were about 50 yards from the mosque.â€œHad we reached even three or four minutes earlier, we probably would have been inside the mosque,â€ he said.â€œEntire team got saved from active shooters,â€ Mr. Khan wrote on Twitter. Another player, Mushfiqur Rahim, tweeted that he never wanted â€œto see this things happen again.â€Aman Singh, who works at a convenience store close to the Deans Avenue mosque, said he had heard the gunshots on Friday afternoon, and that shortly afterward people streamed past the shop, bloody and crying.Mr. Singh, 26, said he knew several people who worshiped at the mosque.â€œMy really good friend goes there,â€ he said, adding that he had not been able to confirm the friend's whereabouts on Friday afternoon.Murders are rare in New Zealand, and gun homicides even rarer. There were 35 murders countrywide in 2017. And since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits each year except 2009, when there were 11.But there are plenty of guns.There were 1.2 million registered firearms in the country of 4.6 million people in 2017, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit.New Zealand law allows any person aged 16 or older with an entry-level firearm license to keep any number of common rifles and shotguns, according to GunPolicy.org, a project hosted by the University of Sydney. Most guns can be purchased without being tracked by law enforcement officials.A mass shooting in Aramoana, New Zealand, in 1990 — when a man killed 13 people, including two 6-year-olds, after a dispute with his neighbor — led directly to tightened gun laws, including restrictions on â€œmilitary-style semiautomatic weapons.â€"
"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — At least 49 people were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a horrific and methodical afternoon slaughter, part of which was broadcast live on the internet after the publication of a white supremacist manifesto online.The massacre, which Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, condemned as a terrorist attack and called â€œan extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,â€ interrupted a day of prayer for a small immigrant community in the nation's third-largest city and shook a country with little history of mass shooting.Harrowing first-person footage, apparently from a camera worn by a gunman as he attacked the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city, was streamed on Facebook — a grim milestone in the evolution of terrorism that raised questions about how tech companies can block extremists from using social media to spread hate and inspire violence.[Follow our live briefing here.]Facebook said it quickly shut down the account, but a 17-minute video showing a man dressed in black shooting at fleeing worshipers and into piles of bodies with a semiautomatic rifle circulated widely online. In addition to those killed, at least 48 people were being treated for gunshot wounds, including young children, the authorities said.The police said a man in his late 20s was arrested and charged with murder but declined to identify him. The police also said they seized several weapons and found two explosive devices on a vehicle.â€œThis is and will be one of New Zealand's darkest days,â€ Ms. Ardern said at a news conference.Schools in the downtown area were locked down for hours after the attacks as the police tried to determine whether the gunman acted alone. The authorities urged residents to stay indoors, asked mosques to close and cleared nearby Cathedral Square, where people had gathered as part of worldwide protests to demand action on climate change.New Zealand's police commissioner, Mike Bush, said three other individuals found near the scene with weapons were also taken into custody, though investigators later said that one probably had nothing to do with the attacks.The shootings were first reported at about 1:40 p.m., around the time of the midday Friday prayer, when the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Mosque, about three miles east, would be most busy. The manifesto had appeared online minutes earlier.The document named both mosques, and links to it were posted on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for hosting message boards with extremist right-wing discussions. The 8chan post included a link to what appeared to be the gunman's Facebook page, where he said he would soon broadcast live video of the attack.But it was not immediately clear whether the name on the page was that of the suspect, and the authorities declined to comment.Ms. Ardern said that many of the victims were most likely migrants to New Zealand or refugees.â€œChristchurch was the home of these victims,â€ she said. â€œFor many this may not have been the place they were born. For many, New Zealand was their choice, the place that they chose to come to and committed themselves to, the place they chose to raise their families.â€She added that New Zealand was likely targeted â€œbecause we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, refuge for those who need it.â€Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, said people were anxious for updates and were worried that friends or family members were among the dead.â€œNobody's answering their phones,â€ she said. â€œWe don't know if they're at the hospital or out of reach. Some have posted that they are safe, but others have not.â€Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from Muslims across the country to arrange the 49 funerals they would need to plan.Historians say Muslims have lived in New Zealand for more than 150 years, but the population has grown with immigration from war-torn countries like Iraq and Afghanistan in the 1990s and 2000s. In a country of nearly five million people, though, only about 46,000 identified as Muslim in the 2013 census.The video of the attack, which appeared to be recorded on a helmet camera, showed the gunman driving to the mosque and then opening fire even before he entered the building. For nearly two minutes, he shoots at fleeing worshipers before he runs back to his car and swaps weapons.He then is seen re-entering the mosque and opening fire again, methodically moving from room to room and shooting into piles of bodies slumped on the green carpets. Several victims can be seen in the footage, many lying on top of one another motionless in a corner of the room.After another few minutes, the gunman leaves again, gets in his vehicle and drives away, pausing occasionally to fire at pedestrians while talking to himself throughout.â€œThere wasn't even time to aim, there was so many targets,â€ he says at one point.The police in New Zealand said they were working to remove the video from the internet and urged people not to share it.Facebook said it was alerted by the police shortly after the livestream started. â€œWe quickly removed both the shooter's Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,â€ Mia Garlick, a Facebook representative, said in a statement. â€œWe're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware.â€Before the shooting began, the gunman made a winking reference to an internet meme, telling viewers to â€œsubscribe to PewDiePie,â€ a reference to the Swedish YouTube star Felix Kjellberg. Mr. Kjellberg, who has been criticized for anti-Semitism over skits that he called satirical, said on Twitter that he felt â€œabsolutely sickenedâ€ that the gunman had mentioned him.The video and Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.The author of the manifesto identifies himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia. He listed his white nationalist heroes, described his animosity toward Muslims and immigrants, and said he chose to use guns in the attacks to stir discord in the United States around the Second Amendment.Aman Singh, 26, who works at a convenience store close to the Al Noor Mosque, said he hid after hearing gunshots and seeing people stream past, bloody and crying.â€œMy really good friend goes there,â€ he said, adding that he had not been able to confirm the friend's whereabouts.Mohammad Isam, a Bangladeshi journalist, posted a video of members of Bangladesh's national cricket team who he said escaped the attack.Christchurch, with about 388,000 residents, is the biggest city on New Zealand's South Island, hugging the Pacific Ocean coast.There hasn't been a mass shooting in New Zealand since 1990, when a man killed 13 people, including two 6-year-olds, after a dispute with his neighbor in the seaside town of Aramoana.That shooting led to tightened gun laws, including restrictions on â€œmilitary style semiautomatic weapons.â€Gun owners must be licensed, a process that includes a review of criminal activity and mental health, attendance at a safety program, an explanation of how the gun would be used, a residence visit to ensure secure storage, and testimonials from relatives and friends.Murders are rare in New Zealand, and gun homicides even rarer. There were 35 murders countrywide in 2017. Since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits each year except 2009, when there were 11.But there are plenty of guns. There were 1.2 million registered firearms in a country of 4.6 million people in 2017, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit."
"Sam Shepard's wild West just got a lot scarier.I'm talking about that shadowy, shifting desertscape occupied so disharmoniously by the two brothers of Shepard's 1980 masterwork, â€œTrue West,â€ which has been given a ripping revival by James Macdonald at the American Airlines Theater. As embodied by a brilliant Ethan Hawke, in full-menace mode, and a tightly wired Paul Dano, everyday sibling rivalry has seldom felt this ominous.[Read more about Paul Dano, and his reflections on acting and directing.]It's not that you worry that one's going to kill the other, in the time-honored tradition of Cain and Abel, although that looms as a possibility. What's really threatening in this Roundabout Theater Company production, which opened on Thursday night, is its creeping, gut-knotting insistence that family is no fortress against a darkness that erases all sense of a separate self.On the contrary. When it comes to getting lost in the gloaming of existential nothingness, there's no place like home.Anyone who knows the work of Shepard, who died in 2017, will be familiar with this discomfiting perspective. â€œA Lie of the Mind,â€ the name of his 1985 portrait of a family in fission, could well be an umbrella title for the series of domestic dramas that preceded it, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning â€œBuried Childâ€ (1978). (Footnote: Mr. Hawke has Shepard cred, having appeared in the 1995 Steppenwolf revival of â€œBuried Childâ€ in Chicago and directed a first-rate â€œLie of the Mindâ€ in New York in 2010.)Written during a decade-long explosion of creativity, these plays present a tragicomic vision of the American family that, for my money, puts him in the exalted company of Eugene O'Neill. â€œTrue Westâ€ — first seen in New York in a misbegotten, miscast production at the Public Theater nearly four decades ago — hasn't always received the solemn respect accorded the others.It is usually thought of as an occasion for Method men — including John Malkovich and Gary Sinise (in 1982) and Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly (who memorably switched roles in rotation in 2000) — to get down and dirty and tear up the scenery. Mr. Hawke and Mr. Dano do all that, especially in the boisterous second act.But Mr. Macdonald — a British director who has expertly interpreted the apocalyptic visions of Caryl Churchill (â€œEscaped Aloneâ€ and â€œA Number,â€ which happened to star Shepard) — is a master at building suspense from seemingly banal elements. And for the first half of his â€œTrue West,â€ he imbues the most prosaic details with mounting tension worthy of Hitchcock.[What's new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter.]Here's the setup: Austin (Mr. Dano), a screenwriter in his early 30s, is taking time away from his family to work at the Southern California home of his mother, who is vacationing in Alaska. (She shows up late in the play, in the pricelessly bewildered form of Marylouise Burke.) To his politely concealed dismay, he is joined by a surprise guest: big brother Lee (Mr. Hawke), a scruffy black sheep whom Austin hasn't seen in five years.As rendered in Mimi Lien's set, Mom's place (in full view of the audience before the show begins) is a sunny slice of California cheesiness, with a garden gnome, flourishing potted plants and a clear view of the house next door. Nothing to be scared of here.Then the play proper starts, in thick darkness, with the repeated crash of guitar chords and a blitz of bright lights that define the proscenium frame, an effect repeated between the succeeding scenes. Gradually, two figures emerge. (Jane Cox did the superb, insinuating lighting.) One of them is Austin, crisply pressed, bespectacled, seated at a typewriter.Then there's the bulky, tall guy by the sink. He looks like trouble — maybe a burglar who would happily pull a knife on you if cornered. To say that he is Austin's brother does not contradict this impression. In Mr. Shepard's universe, home invader and next of kin can easily be one in the same.Accept the satisfying shivers the moment provokes, sit back and get ready to enjoy the most perfectly distilled 50 minutes or so of classic Shepard you're ever likely to see. What happens in the play's first act is, on one level, routine family friction, with the attendant laundry list of grievances about who got the better deal growing up.But the uneasiness inherent in such encounters acquires a shimmering intensity, as in a nightmare that's both set in a place you know and as alien as a distant planet. The two boys are obviously falling back into old patterns of taunting, resentful aggression (Lee) and tightly wound propitiation (Austin).Yet no matter the subject — a dinner plate with a map of Idaho, the screenplay Austin's working on, their alcohol-demented old father or the months alone Lee spent in the Mojave Desert — it somehow feels as if the stakes couldn't be higher. Not because Lee might be planning to loot the neighbors' houses or bollix Austin's deal with his producer (played with a Teflon shield of casualness by Gary Wilmes).No, what's really at stake is their very identities, as Austin and Lee become increasingly exaggerated versions of their scrapping, younger selves. It's a process rendered by Mr. Hawke and Mr. Dano with devastatingly defensive body language.A moment when Lee playfully, nastily dangles the car keys he's taken from Austin feels potentially lethal. And all the while a blanket of nerve-twanging noise — chirping crickets, yipping coyotes, even children at play — seems not to connect but to isolate the brothers from the rest of the world. (Bray Poor's sound design is inspired.)The end of the first act left me breathless. The second act — the celebrated, hilarious, tearing-down-the-house part — felt slightly off its rhythms at the preview performance I saw. It's not that the evermore violent, frenzied and deliciously absurd action (I love the slew of stolen toasters) isn't impeccably staged. But Mr. Dano was nailing the moves without making that final, essential leap into the void, and the tension sagged. I suspect he'll get there as the play's run continues.Mr. Hawke is already delivering a faultless performance, probably his best ever onstage and a worthy bookend to his Oscar-deserving turn as a faith-challenged priest in Paul Schrader's recent film â€œFirst Reformed.â€ His slovenly, combustible Lee is revealed to be as terrified as he is terrifying, in ways you can't help identifying with.Lee, by the way, has his own idea for a movie, a western. It's a story of men chasing each other across a desert, in the dark.â€œThey don't know each one of 'em is afraid, see,â€ Lee says in a hypnotic monologue. â€œEach one separately thinks he's the only one that's afraid. And they keep riding like that straight into the night.â€ That's a perfect prÃ©cis of â€œTrue West,â€ a play that seems to grow in disturbing depth every time it comes back to haunt us."
"(Reuters) - Ravichandran Ashwin's recent 'Mankad' dismissal of Jos Buttler in the Indian Premier League was not ""within the spirit of the game"", the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has said after reviewing footage of the incident.The MCC, custodian of cricket's laws, had earlier said the decision could have gone either way depending on how 'the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball' is interpreted.""Having extensively reviewed the incident again and after further reflection we don't think it was within the spirit of the game,"" Fraser Stewart, the MCC's manager of the laws of cricket, told the Daily Telegraph.Kings XI Punjab captain Ashwin sparked a chorus of disapproval from fellow players and pundits after running out Buttler when the Rajasthan Royals batsman was backing up at the non-striker's end instead of completing his delivery.The dismissal, named after India bowler Vinoo Mankad who ran out Australia's Bill Brown in similar fashion in 1947, is permitted under cricket's laws but viewed by some as going against the spirit of the game.The MCC changed its stance because Ashwin paused after his delivery stride and waited for Buttler to leave the crease before whipping the bails off.""We believe the pause was too long between the time Ashwin reached the crease and the moment it was reasonable to expect the ball would be delivered,"" Stewart added.""When Buttler could have reasonably expected the ball to be delivered, he was in his ground. We now think at the key moment Buttler was in his ground.""Buttler, it's fair to say, did not make a concerted effort to get back into his crease after Ashwin had delayed his delivery, and didn't help himself in that respect.""Stewart said non-strikers should stop trying to gain an advantage by backing up before the ball was bowled.""It's also unfair and against the spirit of cricket for non-strikers to leave their ground too early,"" he added. ""All these debates wouldn't be necessary if non-strikers remained in their ground until the ball is on its way down the pitch."" (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru, Editing by Simon Jennings)"

"KABUL, Afghanistan — If ever a team needed to win big for its fans' sake, it was this one — at this moment.On Monday, Afghanistan's beloved national cricket squad prompted cheers back home by winning its first-ever match in the Test format, the sport's highest level of competition.The win, against Ireland at a Test match in northern India, is an increasingly rare commodity: a good news story in Afghanistan. Security forces there are fighting a desperate, bloody campaign against the Taliban, and many fear that if the United States reaches a deal with the insurgents, it could jeopardize human rights and the safety of ethnic minority groups.â€œPeople are in love with cricket, and amid the news of suicide attacks, bombing of civilians and losses of security forces, it is the only thing that brings happiness,â€ said Nazim Jar Abdurrahimzai, the game development manager at the Afghanistan Cricket Board.Afghan fans have been jubilant on social media since the victory. The cricket board has said that celebrations are planned, and that some fans plan to greet the members of the team when they arrive at the Kabul airport on Wednesday.Praise for the team has also poured in from cricket fans, players and organizations around the world.Even the former cricket star Imran Khan, now the prime minister of neighboring Pakistan, which has tense relations with Afghanistan, congratulated the country on its â€œamazing successes in such a short period of their exposure to international cricket.â€Afghanistan's first cricket team was founded more than a decade ago by players returning home from a refugee camp in Pakistan. The sport later grew into a national obsession, a status it already enjoyed across much of South Asia.Afghan cricket stars like Rashid Khan are now mega-celebrities whose faces are plastered across billboards. Television channels and radio stations avidly follow their matches, and the local fan base has rapidly grown.â€œAfghanistan's cricket team has surmounted obstacles unknown to most athletes — terrorism, displacement, war — and with flair and panache that have won admirers the world over,â€ the cricket journalist Sidharth Monga wrote last year in the Opinion section of The New York Times.Cricket's Test format, in which matches last up to five days, is the sport's most exclusive club. In 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the first new Test countries since Bangladesh was promoted to Test status in 2000.In Afghanistan's inaugural Test match last year, the national team was routed by India in just two days. The team's coach, Phil Simmons, said at the time that while his players had a â€œhugeâ€ learning curve to overcome, they also had an admirable work ethic.â€œNow we know that we have to work five times as hard,â€ Mr. Simmons said.The team's Test victory on Monday came on the fourth day of a match at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, in the northern Indian city of Dehradun. Afghanistan is now only the third country — along with England and Pakistan — to win after just two appearances at the Test level. (Only Australia won faster, on its first try.)President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan called the victory â€œa proud moment for the whole nation.â€Mohammad Nabi, one of the team's stars, vowed that it would not be Afghanistan's last. â€œIf we can put up a good score on the board, then we are confident of beating any team in the world,â€ he said.A major challenge will come this spring, when the team makes its second appearance at the ICC Cricket World Cup in England and Wales. Although Afghanistan is ranked 10th out of 10 teams at the tournament, its captain, Asghar Afghan, said recently that the goal was not merely to show up but to win. Sharaf Naib, 23, a construction worker in Kabul, said by telephone on Tuesday that he had already built a Cricket World Cup trophy — out of snow — in anticipation.â€œThis is the only thing that gives us a break from the ongoing violence and sad incidents happening in the country,â€ he said of the cricket team's success. â€œIt's our only social life.â€"
"MUMBAI — Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal has courted controversy again, despite only recently being brought back to the international fold following a two-year absence, after breaching a team curfew ahead of the fifth one-dayer against Australia.Akmal was sent home from Pakistan's 2017 Champions Trophy squad in England for failing fitness tests and followed that up with a public outburst against head coach Mickey Arthur.He was recalled for the first time since that spat for Pakistan's five-match series against Australia in the United Arab Emirates.The Pakistan Cricket Board said the 28-year-old had been fined 20 percent of his match fee and received an official reprimand for a late night-out ahead of Sunday's fifth ODI against Australia in Dubai.The cricketer pleaded guilty to the charge, apologised and accepted the sanction, the PCB added.""I am glad that Umar has realised his mistake, and has accepted and apologised for his actions, which were clearly unprofessional and in no way can be ignored or overlooked,"" PCB managing director Wasim Khan said in a statement.""The PCB expects a high level of professionalism and commitment from its players, and this action is a reiteration and timely reminder that any indiscipline shall not be tolerated or accepted.""Akmal made his debut as a 19-year-old in 2009 in a test against New Zealand. Once considered the future of Pakistan's batting, he played the last of his 16 matches in the longest format in 2011.He was part of the playing side in all five matches in the UAE and totalled 150 runs during the series, which Australia won 5-0.

"SYDNEY — Jhye Richardson's hopes of playing at the Cricket World Cup have received a boost after scans on his injured shoulder ruled out any bone damageÂ or fracture for the young Australia fast bowler.The 22-year-old completed only half his quota of overs in Sunday's second one-day international against Pakistan in Sharjah before he was forced off the field having dislocated his bowling shoulder when trying to save a boundary.Richardson, who had been considered a certainty for Australia's World Cup squad, sat out the rest of the match with his arm in a sling and was sent home immediately for scans.""The scans demonstrated the usual soft tissue damage we expect following a dislocation but fortunatelyÂ has excluded any bone damageÂ or fracture,"" Richard Saw, Australian men's team doctor, said in a statement on Thursday.""We are hopeful that Jhye will not require surgery but he will see a shoulder specialist early next week for a further opinion. We will be able to provide an update in respect to next steps once we have all the information on the table.""With injured regular quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood already racing to be fit for the World Cup, Australia can ill afford more casualties.The right-arm paceman has had a strong season during which he made his test debut and also established himself in the 50-overs side.""Everyone in the Australian camp is hopeful, I'm hopeful and in high spirits,"" Richardson was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia website cricket.com.au. ""I'm not ruling out the World Cup at this stage, that's definitely not an option.""It's all about getting the shoulder right at this stage.""JL (Coach Justin Langer) said he's pleased with how I've been going about my business, I was really satisfied with how I played in India and going into the Pakistan series as well I was happy with the way I was playing.""The shoulder injury is unfortunate, but these things do happen and I'm eager to bounce back quickly.""Australia will defend their 50-over World Cup title in England and Wales from May 30.

"JALALABAD, Afghanistan — During a lull in Afghanistan's never-ending war, before the fighting season resumes once again in the spring, Taliban fighters recall laying down their Kalashnikovs and, for a brief moment, enjoying a game of cricket.The sport is the only one most of the fighters enjoy, commanders say, with matches attracting hundreds of spectators from Taliban-controlled villages when there is no fighting. They are also fans of the increasingly successful national team.""I love cricket,"" said Mullah Badruddin, a Taliban commander in Khogyani district of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, where a tournament organized by the militants at the start of last winter drew large crowds.""When Afghanistan play against another team, we listen to the radio with great interest and we also check for scores in social media and follow those in Facebook who give live updates,"" he told Reuters by telephone.First played in Afghanistan by British troops in the 19th Century, the game was adopted by Afghans in the refugee camps of cricket-loving Pakistan, where more than 3 million fled a Soviet invasion and civil war in the 1980s and 1990s, and has since made huge strides in the country, particularly among ethnic Pashtuns in the eastern border provinces. Taj Malook Khan, who helped set up the Afghan Cricket Club in Kacha Gari refugee camp outside the Pakistani city of Peshawar in the 1980s, and a small group of players used to cross into Afghanistan during the 1990s Taliban era to play and promote cricket.The Taliban had banned games such as cricket and football in the early years of their austere rule because they believed they kept men away from prayers, according to former national cricketer Hasti Gul, but later became more tolerant of cricket.From there, despite at least two attacks in the past couple of years on cricket matches claimed by the ultra radical Islamic State group, the game now rivals football for popularity in a country that has long been cut off from international sport.STAR NAMESAdmitted as a full member of the International Cricket Council in 2017, Afghanistan won its first five-day Test match against Ireland last month after making steady progress in the lower levels of the international game.However it is in the dynamic, shorter form of the sport that Afghans have had most impact.Players such as spin bowler Rashid Khan or big hitting batsman Mohammad Nabi Esakhil have become undisputed stars of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the razzle-dazzle showcase of so-called T20 cricket, the 12th season of which has just got under way.Despite the Taliban's former suspicion of organized sports and their opposition to much of the transformation in Afghanistan since their hardline Islamic regime was toppled in 2001, many of the mainly Pashtun movement's fighters are fans.Unlike football, which offends the sensibilities of some very conservative Muslims because it is normally played in shorts, cricket is played in long sleeves and trousers, in line with traditional dress codes. It also bears some resemblance to traditional Afghan children's games involving throwing and using sticks to hit smaller sticks or balls.Karim Sadiq, a former batsman in the national team and an early pioneer of the sport who visited some Taliban-controlled areas in eastern Afghanistan this year, said he was mobbed by fighters asking about the game and their favorite players.A video clip he shot on his mobile phone shows dozens of Taliban, many with Kalashnikov automatic rifles slung across their shoulders, dissecting the quality of the team.""I like all the players but my favorite is Rashid Khan Arman,"" says one fighter, referring to the young spin bowler who stars for the Afghan national side and IPL's Sunrisers Hyderabad. ""His bowling is amazing.""WORLD CUP DREAMWith the approach of the cricket World Cup in England and Wales from May to July, Afghanistan's hopes of making a dent in the tournament are higher than they have ever been, even if few give them a chance against giants of the game such as India, Australia or England.""We have a very strong team and my dream is Afghanistan bring the World Cup home,"" said Hazrat Gul, a young cricketer in the eastern city of Jalalabad, as he prepared to play a friendly match against a team from neighboring Kunar province.As peace talks between the U.S. government and Taliban officials continue and Afghanistan looks for a way out of 40 years of conflict, excitement is building and officials and government ministers lavish praise on the players, whom President Ashraf Ghani has called national heroes.From the other side of the war, the feeling is similar. Sadiq who has just returned to practice after a long injury, aiming to take part in the upcoming World Cup, said the Taliban usually send them congratulatory messages through social media and on his cellphone when Afghanistan win.Such broad appeal has seen the sport widely hailed as a unifying force in Afghanistan, a patchwork of different languages and cultures, sometimes at peace with each other but increasingly in recent years in conflict.ETHNIC DIVIDESNot everyone is on board the cricket bandwagon, however.Look deeper, and the state of the game has much to say about a country where sport has repeatedly attracted violence, including suicide attacks on cricket and wrestling matches, and where politics is increasingly divided along ethnic lines that shade into all aspects of life.For many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras, cricket is a sport for Pashtuns, the dominant ethnic group from the south and east of the country that has provided almost all kings and presidents throughout Afghan history.""I have no interest and don't know anything about cricket,"" said Ahmad Jawad, a shopkeeper in Parwan, a mainly Tajik province north of Kabul. ""It's a Pashtun game with Pashtun players, so let them enjoy their game.""After the Taliban fell following the U.S.-led campaign of 2001, Sadiq and Gul - brothers who, like many teammates, learned their cricket in Pakistan - and other players struggled to convince Tajik commanders from the victorious Northern Alliance that swept into Kabul to allow them to continue playing the game.""Palace officials told us to join Afghan guard units and forget about cricket,"" said Gul, who recalled having to cancel a provincial tournament in Kabul in 2005 after losing a fistfight with soccer players who wanted to use the pitch.Now, with the IPL beamed into homes all over the country and the looming World Cup, he feels change is coming and the sport can give Afghanistan a platform no other can equal, one that offers hope for a more normal future after so many years of war.""We literally had no support from the government for so many years before they have realized we could bring glory to our country,"" he said. ""Now everyone loves cricket and we are so proud to raise our national flag on the world stage.""

"SYDNEY — Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the ""dangerous"" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night. Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions. The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match. ""It was dangerous, first and foremost,"" Muscat told reporters. ""To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it.

""All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway.""Some 3,000 square metres of turf at the ground were replaced last month after huge divots came up during a rugby union match between the New South Wales Waratahs and Queensland Reds. The Sydney Roosters rugby league team have also used the ground and the various codes have varied the layout of the pitch in order to mitigate the impact of the three different types of grass on the surface. The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988. It has also been the home of the Sydney Swans Australian Rules team since 1982.

"The Swiss watch brand Hublot, which has partnered with the likes of the FIFA World Cup and the Ferrari Formula One team, has announced that it will continue its role as official timekeeper of the Cricket World Cup, with the 2019 competition scheduled to start May 30.The event is sponsored by the International Cricket Council and held every four years — this year in England and Wales.Hublot's previous high-profile sporting affiliations have put it in competition with more established watch brands, such as Rolex, Omega and Audemars Piguet, each of which has successfully used sports to raise brand awareness. Hublot was founded in 1980 and has been owned by LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton since 2008.Ricardo Guadalupe, Hublot's chief executive, said that Hublot's strategy was to invest in sports that have a global footprint and little, if any, association with other Swiss watch brands. In the past, Audemars Piguet had worked with Sachin Tendulkar and Ulysse Nardin with Yuvraj Singh, both Indian cricketers, but Hublot is the first to partner with the organizing council.â€œCricket is virgin territory,â€ Mr. Guadalupe said in an interview during the announcement of the partnership at the brand's Bond Street boutique in London.Mr. Guadalupe said cricket also would give Hublot a route to market in targeted regions. â€œCricket is huge in India,â€ he said. â€œThere is potential to grow heavily in India and with Indians, who buy all over the world.â€Cricket is India's most popular sport. The national broadcaster Star India reported that its television coverage of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, also sponsored by Hublot, was watched by more than 600 million people in the country. (The 2019 Super Bowl had a domestic audience of 98.2 million, according to the research firm Nielsen.)â€œWe've had double-digit growth in India since we got involved in cricket,â€ Mr. Guadalupe said, adding that this summer Hublot plans to open its first stand-alone boutique in Mumbai, India's financial center and largest city, and is working on one in New Delhi.Mr. Guadalupe declined to disclose the cost of the I.C.C. partnership, but said that it was in the â€œsingle millionsâ€ of dollars and much less costly than Hublot's soccer affiliations.As part of the cricket deal, Hublot had announced a 100-piece limited-edition watch, a version of its 45-millimeter Classic Fusion Chronograph that is scheduled for release on March 23. (Mr. Guadalupe said the 2,018-piece limited-edition connected watch that Hublot made for the 2018 World Cup sold out in four weeks.)Mr. Guadalupe also said that some top Hublot customers would be given a special experience at the Cricket World Cup, but that the reason for the partnership was to â€œbuild and shape the consumer of tomorrow.â€"
"In November 2016, American diplomats in Cuba complained of persistent, high-pitched sounds followed by a range of symptoms, including headaches, nausea and hearing loss. Exams of nearly two dozen of them eventually revealed signs of concussions or other brain injuries, and speculation about the cause turned to weapons that blast sound or microwaves. Amid an international uproar, a recording of the sinister droning was widely circulated in the news media. On Friday, two scientists presented evidence that those sounds were not so mysterious after all. They were made by crickets, the researchers concluded.That's not to say that the diplomats weren't attacked, the scientists added — only that the recording is not of a sonic weapon, as had been suggested.Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley, and Fernando Montealegre-Z of the University of Lincoln in England studied a recording of the sounds made by diplomats and published by The Associated Press.â€œThere's plenty of debate in the medical community over what, if any, physical damage there is to these individuals,â€ said Mr. Stubbs in a phone interview. â€œAll I can say fairly definitively is that the A.P.-released recording is of a cricket, and we think we know what species it is.â€Mr. Stubbs presented the results of the analysis at the annual meeting of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology. He and Dr. Montealegre-Z also posted an early version of their study online. They plan to submit the paper to a scientific journal in the next few days.When Mr. Stubbs first heard the recording, he was reminded of insects he came across while doing field work in the Caribbean. When he and Dr. Montealegre-Z downloaded the sound file, they found that its acoustic patterns — such as the rate of pulses and the strongest frequencies — were very similar to the songs of certain kinds of insects.Male singing insects produce regular patterns during courtship. Females are attracted to certain males based on their songs, which has led to the evolution of different songs in different species.If the sounds heard by the diplomats were made by insects, Mr. Stubbs and Dr. Montealegre-Z reasoned, it might be possible to pinpoint the particular species. To search for a match, the researchers analyzed field recordings of North American insects stored in an online database at the University of Florida. They found a striking resemblance to one species in particular: the Indies short-tailed cricket.Yet the cricket's song differs from the Cuban recording in one important respect. The noises heard by the diplomats were erratic, while the insects make high-pitched, rapid-fire pulses.Mr. Stubbs suspected that this mismatch might be an artifact of the recording itself. Diplomats made their recordings inside houses, while biologists have recorded the crickets in the wild.So Mr. Stubbs played the cricket recording in a house. As the calls bounced off the walls, they echoed in a pattern similar to the irregular pulses heard on the Cuban recording.The song of the Indies short-tailed cricket â€œmatches, in nuanced detail, the A.P. recording in duration, pulse repetition rate, power spectrum, pulse rate stability, and oscillations per pulse,â€ the scientists wrote in their analysis.Experts on cricket songs said the analysis was well done. â€œIt all seems to make sense,â€ said Gerald Pollack of McGill University, who studies acoustic communication among insects. â€œIt's a pretty well supported hypothesis.â€When the American diplomats first complained of the strange noises in Cuba, they dismissed the possibility that insects were responsible. But short-tailed crickets are exceptional: They have long been known to make a tremendous racket.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]â€œThe song of the males of this cricket, here, is a continuous ringing z-z-z-z-z-z- of tremendous volume and penetration which practically fills a room with veritable din,â€ an entomologist in the Dominican Republic reported in 1957. Mr. Stubbs recorded short-tailed crickets while in Costa Rica, and he found their songs overpowering. â€œThey're incredibly loud,â€ he said. â€œYou can hear them from inside a diesel truck going forty miles an hour on the highway.â€The Indies short-tailed cricket is known to live in the Florida Keys, Jamaica and Grand Cayman. A closely related cricket is known to live in Cuba, and Mr. Stubbs suspects that its Indies cousin lives there, too.Mr. Stubbs said that his conclusion does not rule out an attack on American diplomats. But the sounds linked to the initial complaints may have been a red herring.â€œIt's entirely possible that they got sick with some other completely unrelated thing that was not a sonic attack, or that they were targeted in some other way,â€ he said. Dr. Douglas Smith, who led the medical examination of the American diplomats, questioned how much a single recording could reveal about the experience. Some patients didn't report hearing anything unusual, he noted, while others heard a range of sounds.â€œIt could be like a low-tone motor, or metal scraping, or like driving in a car with the back window open,â€ said Dr. Smith, director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania.Dr. Smith wouldn't rule out the possibility that some diplomats might have heard crickets, but said that had no bearing on the real damage they've suffered. â€œThese patients have gone through a lot,â€ he added. â€œI would like to know what the sounds are, but for us the more important thing is really what's going on in the patients' brains and what we can do about it.â€"
"ST.-OMER, France — The players erupted in joy, dancing and shouting in Pashto, celebrating their second victory in a regional cricket tournament. It might have been a familiar scene in parts of Afghanistan or Pakistan, but it was far less so here in northern France.The St.-Omer Cricket Club Stars, known as Soccs, had just won a tournament on their home turf, a new cricket field next to a cow pasture. For their captain, Javed Ahmadzai, however, the sweetest triumph lay elsewhere.â€œThe best victory is off the pitch,â€ said Mr. Ahmadzai, 32, a stonemason who arrived in France from Afghanistan in 2005. â€œWhen we teach cricket to children in local schools and they won't let us go, or tell their parents: â€˜You see, Mom, migrants aren't all mean.' â€Bringing cricket to life in St.-Omer is about far more than sports for Mr. Ahmadzai and his teammates. It is an opportunity to be part of the community, to be thought of as local champions rather than just as foreigners.That hasn't always been easy.During the European migration crisis of 2015, refugees hoping to reach Britain gathered in squalid camps in northern France, living in treacherous conditions in places like the â€œJungleâ€ in Calais, less than 30 miles north of St.-Omer.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant party in France and presidential candidate, argued that the country had been hurt by â€œmassive immigration,â€ and often cited the camps in her attacks.Her message was well received in the region, and in the first round of the presidential election last year, more residents of St.-Omer voted for Ms. Le Pen than for any other candidate. (She won 39 percent of the town's vote in the second round compared with 33.9 percent nationally.)Yet two years after the government cleared the â€œJungle,â€ in October 2016, there are still frequent police raids on migrant camps, and the lives of many seem stuck in limbo. The number of migrants in the Calais area has since dropped to 400 from 8,000. Many, including some who once lived in the Jungle and hoped to cross the English Channel, have decided to stay in St.-Omer.They study, work or seek jobs and, in the case of some Soccs players, hope that their sport will help them establish themselves in the town of 16,000 people. St.-Omer has sheltered more than 5,600 since 2015, most of them in a center for underage refugees.â€œWhenever young Afghans arrive in St.-Omer, one of the first things they ask is where they can play cricket,â€ said Jean-FranÃ§ois Roger, the regional director of France Terre d'Asile, a state-funded organization that helps refugees. â€œSoccs gives them a framework. It helps them move forward and build something here.â€France is not exactly known for cricket, a sport played primarily in the former British Empire. It hardly figures in the national sports pantheon, with 1,800 cricket players in some 50 French clubs, compared with 2.2 million registered soccer players. Yet with the influx of migrants from Afghanistan, the number of cricket teams in northern France has grown to nine from two.The Soccs are among them. In summer 2016, Mr. Ahmadzai and other Afghans were playing cricket with a homemade ball in a public park in St.-Omer when a local businessman who was out running, Christophe Silvie, stopped to ask them about the game. A few months later, Mr. Silvie and Mr. Ahmadzai founded the club with another volunteer living nearby, Nicolas Rochas.The team practiced in a local gymnasium and won a first tournament. Then another.Today, some 30 players from St.-Omer and surrounding areas, ages 15 to 33, have helped turn the town into a center of cricket excellence. (In reality, there was little suspense in the recent final: The club has two teams, and both beat their rivals in the regular league and the playoffs. So the club's first team played the second in that final match.)â€œCricket has helped the players gain priceless self-confidence and fight loneliness and isolation,â€ said Mr. Rochas, the vice president of Soccs, who watched the final in September with his two young children. â€œIt's more than a club — we are now like a family.â€For years, St.-Omer was the only town in the region with a France Terre d'Asile center for underage refugees, most of whom came from Eritrea and Afghanistan. In 2017, Afghanistan was the second country of origin for asylum seekers in France, with 6,000 of a total 100,000 requests. The organization accommodated 2,230 migrants in the town in 2017, up from 300 in 2013. Many of the young Soccs players went through the center.â€œI feel like I've grown up so much here, and I know the people, so I want those titles to be like a gift for St.-Omer,â€ Abdulwali Akulkhil, a 17-year-old Soccs player from Afghanistan who once lived in the center, said of the team's victories.William Gasparini, a professor of sociology at the University of Strasbourg who specializes in sports, said that team activities could indeed be a springboard for integration, providing connections far beyond the field.â€œManagers of amateur clubs are often local businessmen or people who are well connected in the area, so it gives the migrants some useful social capital,â€ he said.Mr. Rochas, the team vice president who is known among the players as Big Brother, has helped several get into training programs in farm trucking and mechanics. He also helped another player, who speaks five languages and wants to become a diplomat, get an internship in the French Parliament.Yet, for all the progress on and off the field, Soccs players have faced resistance. Xenophobic messages popped up on social media when the town's mayor, FranÃ§ois Decoster, said the club could build a cricket ground on an unused plot of land on the edge of the town. Some posts threatened to damage the site and others spread a rumor that a mosque would be built there.â€œI had to explain again and again who these young men were and where they came from,â€ said Mr. Decoster, a member of a centrist party. â€œIntegration can be a long, rocky process.â€The mayor says that efforts to help refugees settle â€œat a local level and at the appropriate scaleâ€ through initiatives like sports could help fight many preconceptions. If more cities and countries favored such activities, â€œwe wouldn't have the Salvinis, the Orbans and the Le Pens,â€ he said, referring to the interior minister of Italy, the prime minister of Hungary, and the French far-right leader.Complaints about Soccs seem to have tapered, but Mr. Decoster's optimism has yet to be followed by a strong showing of local support for the team. Only a few dozen people attended the final, many of them volunteers or acquaintances of the club's managers.Hours later, when the victorious players honked horns and waved French flags as they circled the town's central plaza, most of those sitting outdoors stared at them, intrigued but unaware of what they were celebrating.â€œWe've got prizes, compliments and promises, but many players wonder why, after a second title, there isn't more local enthusiasm,â€ said Mr. Rochas, the club's vice president.In 2017, the club received a European Citizen's Prize, awarded each year by the European Parliament to citizens or organizations that promote cross-border cooperation and understanding. But it still lacks the resources and volunteers it would need to play in France's national cricket league, as its victories at the regional level qualify it to do.Perhaps even more critical is the need to attract local players, some team members said. So far, a doctor living in St.-Omer is the only French-born player out of 30.â€œWe can't only play among foreigners. We need new French recruits,â€ said Tazim Abbas, a 19-year-old player from Pakistan. â€œOtherwise, who will keep the club running when I have a job and a life here?â€"
"The threat of anti-Muslim bigotry in Britain has been growing, and some politicians from the governing Conservative Party have been encouraging it.In a newspaper column in August, Boris Johnson, the former Conservative foreign secretary — who is chummy with Steve Bannon and fancies himself an upper-class English version of President Trump — compared Muslim women who wear face veils to â€œbank robbersâ€ and â€œletter boxes.â€Shaun Bailey, a politician from the Conservative Party, who has been chosen as its candidate for London's mayoral election, took 13 years to offer a conditional apology for writing in a 2005 pamphlet that the effect of celebrating Muslim and Hindu festivals is to â€œrob Britain of its communityâ€ without which â€œwe slip into a crime-riddled cesspool.â€In September, in what police are investigating as a hate crime, a car ran over pedestrians outside an Islamic center in Cricklewood, a northwest London neighborhood, injuring two people. A report in July by Tell MAMA, a group that monitors anti-Muslim activity, revealed a 26 percent increase in Islamophobic attacks in 2017. The victims were mostly Muslim women. A recent survey by the think tank British Future found that whenever Islam was mentioned by those interviewed, it was â€œalmost always in a negative context.â€Except, that is, on the cricket field. Perhaps surprisingly, the England cricket team, that most traditional of national institutions, has been leading the way in creating a more inclusive environment for its Muslim players.Team sports are all about creating a cohesive identity. But instead of expecting every player to conform to the cultural codes of the team, the England and Wales Cricket Board acknowledges that every player is different and needs to be treated individually. In doing so it has made the team stronger. The Conservative Party, and indeed Britain as a whole, could learn a lot from the cricket team's approach. The life and cricket career of Moeen Ali, a visibly Muslim player on the England cricket team, illustrates how both the country and its minorities thrive when British institutions accommodate the religious and cultural needs of minorities.Mr. Ali, who is a religious Muslim, wears a luxurious beard, prays in the dressing room and fasts during five-day Test cricket matches, symbolizes something bigger than the game. Every time Mr. Ali plays for England, British Muslims like me are willing him to succeed.When someone as devout as Mr. Ali thrives in the pressure cooker of professional sport, it lends hope for a better future to 2.8 million British Muslims. Mr. Ali was born in the city of Birmingham, in 1987 to British-Pakistani parents.His grandfather Shafayat Ali was part of a wave of South Asian migrants who moved to Birmingham and cities in the north of England like Bradford and Manchester to work in the manufacturing sector. His grandmother was an Englishwoman named Betty Cox who met Shafayat Ali at a factory in Birmingham in the late 1940s. His family tree, Mr. Ali says, â€œis a bridge between England and Pakistan.â€Mr. Ali made his debut for the England Test team in 2014. He established himself as a cricketing force by winning a dramatic victory for England in a match against South Africa in July 2017. Mr. Ali took three wickets in three balls — the first England spinner to take a hat trick in 79 years.After his match-winning performance, the players gathered on the grass for the traditional group photograph and Champagne-spraying celebrations. Mr. Ali, who doesn't touch alcohol, stood apart. Alastair Cook, the great batsman and former captain of the team, noticed his isolation. â€œMake sure Moeen gets in the picture first and then we can spray afterward,â€ Mr. Cook insisted. And Mr. Ali was welcomed into the frame, he recalled in his recently published memoir, â€œMoeen.â€Not everyone in the game had been so considerate. When Mr. Ali was first selected for the national team, the veteran sports columnist Michael Henderson took issue with his long beard, remarking that he was â€œopting to stand outâ€ and queried why he said he felt like he was representing Muslims when he played.Mr. Henderson was reframing an old debate about national identity set off by the Conservative politician Norman Tebbit, who in 1990 said that British South Asians and Afro-Caribbeans should support the England cricket team — not India, Pakistan or the West Indies. â€œAre you still harking back to where you came from?â€ Mr. Tebbit asked dismissively.Mr. Tebbit's intervention was especially fraught because cricket is played almost exclusively by countries that were once part of the British Empire. Cheering on the great West Indies or Pakistan teams of the 1980s was a way for ethnic-minority Britons to express their resentment of an England that they felt did not welcome them. It was also a way of retaining emotional ties to their parents' countries.Mr. Ali's dual inheritances do not fit the simplicity of the Tebbit identity test. Adil Rashid, another Pakistani-origin cricketer who recently became a regular on the England Test match squad, speaks in a broad Yorkshire accent, while Mr. Ali has a Midlands accent. Yet in the dressing room, they chat about tactics in the Kashmiri language of their ancestors.English cricket realized that it can only be strengthened by an open-minded attitude to minorities. Nasser Hussain, the son of an Indian father and English mother, captained the team from 1999 to 2003. Mr. Ali himself is not expected to keep quiet over issues he feels strongly about. When he was censured by the International Cricket Board for wearing â€œSave Gazaâ€ and â€œFree Palestineâ€ wristbands during a 2014 test cricket match, the England and Wales Cricket Board supported his right to free expression.Mr. Ali's easygoing demeanor has made him a favorite in the dressing room and with the fans. After a bad run earlier this year, he was dropped from the team. But he worked hard and fought back to earn a spot and won the title of Man of the Match, for his outstanding performance in a match against India in September.He was motivated to put in his best for the team by that moment in 2016 when Mr. Cook ensured that he was included in the celebrations and the group photograph. â€œI felt this was a team I could give anything for,â€ he remarked. The Conservative Party and the country at large could learn from Mr. Cook's and Mr. Ali's example. "
"In recent days, as India and Pakistan came almost to the brink of war, the members of the Boston Gymkhana Sports Club — a cricket club that, like many in the United States, has members from both countries — did not interrupt their usual social calendar.Some members were on edge about the escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations, which began two weeks ago when a suicide bombing in the disputed region of Kashmir killed more than 40 Indian soldiers. And many had sharply different perspectives on the conflict.Rajiv Shah, 46, who emigrated in 1999 from the Indian state of Gujarat, was approving when the Indian government conducted airstrikes in Pakistan, claiming to kill a large number of terrorists.Others felt that India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, was exploiting the situation, intentionally ramping up tensions in hopes of solidifying his support in the coming elections.At least a couple of members gave some credence to conspiracy theories that the Indian government itself might be behind the terrorist attack.And yet, there was a birthday to celebrate: The club's founder, Bikram Singh, was turning 53. The club members, accustomed to setting aside their differences and carrying on with their friendships at times of heightened hostility between the two countries, were planning a party.â€œNo matter what, we live and play or interact with people that we completely disagree with sometimes, but we still manage,â€ said Mr. Singh, whose family is from the northwestern Indian state of Punjab.The past week has seen some people in India and Pakistan openly root for war, while others have urged the country's leaders to find a way to end the crisis. (Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan — himself a former cricket star — made a move in that direction, and gained an international publicity coup, when he released an Indian pilot whom Pakistan had captured, reducing tensions somewhat, although shelling continued along the disputed border.)In the United States, sentiments were similarly mixed: Some Indian-Americans protested outside the Pakistani consulates in New York and Chicago, accusing the country of harboring terrorists, while others joined marches for peace.But among the members of the Boston Gymkhana Sports Club, there was no palpable unease as they gathered on Sunday evening at Mr. Singh's comfortable home in Norfolk, about 40 minutes southwest of Boston. Mr. Singh, who had just returned from a vacation to India — his trip home took some 51 hours, because his flight had to be diverted to avoid Pakistani airspace, he said — wore a saffron-colored vest and sipped whiskey. Vegetable fritters and other appetizers were laid out, and club members and their wives and a few teenage children greeted each other with hugs.The roughly 40 guests were a subset of the cricket club's membership, which Mr. Singh said is between 150 and 200, depending on the year. The majority are from India; Mr. Singh estimated that about 10 percent are from Pakistan.Over all, several members agreed, the club members do not discuss the decades-long conflict between India and Pakistan much.â€œSome of it is deferential, so you obviously try not to hurt the other person's feelings,â€ Nafis Ahmad, 51, who is from Karachi, explained the day before the party. He added: â€œOur club is kind of gentlemanly in a sense. We try not to delve into topics that are too controversial.â€This is striking given how much time the club members spend together. Games last some six hours, and afterward, the club members will often spend another six hours eating dinner and drinking together. In the winter, when they don't play cricket, they play poker in a large upstairs room in Mr. Singh's home, decorated with dozens of cricket trophies and nearly as many bottles of liquor. (The amount of socializing has led the club to adopt an unofficial motto: â€œWe also play cricket.â€)There have been times when geopolitics have briefly intruded on the club's bonhomie, and early on, one episode led to a member being ejected. That was in 1999, shortly after Mr. Singh had founded the club, and when it had only one or two Pakistani members.That spring and summer, India and Pakistan briefly went to war in Kashmir. Mr. Singh said he received a phone call one morning from an Indian-American club member demanding that the Pakistani members be kicked out.Mr. Singh said he was stunned. â€œI said, â€˜You know what? You're not going to play in our club anymore — that's not the kind of club we are.' â€On Sunday, at a reporter's request, a group of the party guests agreed to move into the poker room to discuss the most recent escalation. There was no one from Kashmir, the region at the center of the rivalry, whose residents are often left out of the debate about the two country's actions. It wasn't long before differences emerged.Omar Virk, 28, who grew up outside Lahore and came here three and a half years ago to study for his bachelor's degree at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said he believed that India's prime minister was purposefully stoking the conflict.â€œModi is trying to push into this one,â€ he said. â€œYou know how he won the last election, right? He was anti-Pakistan from the start.â€â€œI disagree with that,â€ said Moin Ghouse, 38, who is from the Indian city of Hyderabad.â€œI think Modi is politically savvy enough to understand the risks involved in going for an all-out war,â€ Mr. Ghouse added.Mr. Virk began talking about theories he said were being discussed on Indian television suggesting that Mr. Modi himself was behind the terrorist attack. â€œNobody can prove that,â€ he added, though he said he had been thinking the same thing.Others said the idea was absurd.Mr. Shah, the club member from Gujarat — Mr. Modi's home state, where he was chief minister in 2002 when deadly religious riots took place in which roughly a thousand people, mostly Muslims, were killed — said many Indians were thrilled that Mr. Modi had taken a stand and attacked Pakistan in response to the suicide bombing.As competing conversations broke out, Mr. Ahmad, the club member from Karachi, said he had been worried in recent days about the possibility of war, because he believed that India increasingly saw itself as a superpower.â€œI was a little unnerved that we may be — on the other side of the border, some of our brothers may be a little bit too much trigger-happy, and they would say, â€˜O.K., these guys have been doing these shenanigans for us for many, many years, let's show them.'â€One of Mr. Singh's close friends, Parak Ananta, began reminding the group that dinner was getting cold downstairs. Eventually, everyone went down to eat.Asked when club members last had a conversation like this, Mr. Singh said that it had been years ago, when he started a Facebook group for club members and others to discuss a series of India-Pakistan cricket games. Mr. Ananta had thought starting the group was a bad idea — that passions would run too high, and people would say things they would regret. Looking back, Mr. Ananta said that he felt he had been right; the conversation had damaged some friendships.â€œWe have to be real sometime,â€ Mr. Singh insisted. â€œWe can't just be in a cocoon all the time.â€Mr. Ananta disagreed. â€œEven between wife and husband there are certain things that are taboo,â€ he said."

"MUMBAI — Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli has hinted at making wholesale changes to his team after Tuesday's Indian Premier League (IPL) defeat to Rajasthan Royals left them the only winless side in the Twenty20 tournament.With both sides without a victory in their first three matches, it was the Royals who broke their duck with a seven-wicket win in Jaipur, spearheaded by Shreyas Gopal's 3-12 with his leg-spin and a 59 from Jos Buttler's bat.Kohli dropped his Rajasthan counterpart Ajinkya Rahane on one and his team dropped three more catches to aid their opponents' chase. Rahane went on to make 22 and combined with Buttler to give Rajasthan a brisk opening stand of 60.""In a tournament like the IPL, when the team doesn't have any momentum, things can get difficult,"" Kohli said after the game. ""The guys can get a little tight in the field. Bodies can get stiff. A bit of nervousness as well. ""Look we have to consider everything. The team hasn't got off to a great start. These things (dropped catches) look really bad when they happen in this sort of phase for a team.""Despite having Kohli and talismanic South African AB de Villiers in their ranks, Bangalore's batting has failed twice in four matches. They were all out for 70 in the IPL opener against Chennai and bundled out for 113 on Sunday against the Sunrisers, losing by a huge margin of 118 runs. They fared better against Rajasthan, scoring 158-4, but it still proved inadequate.""This tournament is not that long,"" Kohli said. ""You have to be on the eight ball. You have to think on your feet. You have to think of the best possible combination going forward. ""We will definitely sit down and consider talking about what we can do. What can we do to get the balance right. Hopefully get some fresh guys in and they can make some cracking match-winning performances for us and get the team going.""Kohli, who also skippers India in all three formats, has his work cut out for him if he is to lead Bangalore to a first IPL title after losing their first four games. ""We have 10 games to go. If we start turning things around pretty soon, then we can get on a roll as well. We have to keep believing as a side,"" he said.

"(Reuters) - As the heavyweights of international cricket set their sights on lifting the World Cup at Lord's in the English summer, Zimbabwe are confronted with the reality that for the first time in four decades they won't feature in the showpiece event.Instead of plotting upsets on cricket's biggest stage, they will be playing for pride at home in a low-key series starting April 10. They will be playing the United Arab Emirates â€“ the same team that deprived them of a World Cup berth by way of an unexpected three run victory in last year's qualifying tournament.Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) have increasingly struggled to schedule high quality fixtures as their financial position worsens.Touring depends on the agreeability of foreign boards â€“ a tour of India slated for this month was quietly shelved earlier in the year â€“ while hosting top-ranked teams is expensive.In a statement, ZC said that a recently proposed one-day international tour by Afghanistan wasn't viable, despite the boards agreeing to share expenses, because of ""the prohibitive costs of broadcasting the matches live on television"".The situation has left Zimbabwe, who last played at international level four months ago during a tour of Bangladesh, sliding further away from the mainstream and into cricket's second tier.After the UAE series, their next assignment will be a limited-overs tour of the Netherlands in June.DOMESTIC CRICKETThe desperate economic state of the country, where inflation has now reached a decade-high 59.39 percent on the back of foreign currency shortages, has impacted cricket operations at all levels.Zimbabwe's provincial first-class tournament, the Logan Cup, is contested by four franchise teams and provides a vital proving ground for players with national team ambitions â€“ when it's not being disrupted.""It's really important playing club and in particular franchise cricket as that's the build up to the international stage for us"", wicketkeeper Regis Chakabva, 31, told Reuters.""As players we always want to play more games but unfortunately this season has been really short for us.""The 2018-19 season featured just 12 matches. One match was postponed for two months, while two matches were abandoned after a 150 percent increase in fuel prices spurred civil unrest in the capital city, Harare.""Nothing beats game time and hopefully the administration resolves that next season"", the test centurion concluded.Before the season commenced, ZC abolished the Rising Stars team â€“ an academy initiative designed to give young players extra exposure. With fewer teams, Zimbabwe's small talent pool is less thinly spread. However, the number of matches each team played reduced from eight to six.Ryan Burl, who featured regularly for the Rising Stars after making his one-day international debut in 2017, says that prior to the Logan Cup he had never played a game of cricket longer than two days.""It was completely new to me, and I loved it from my first game"", the 24-year-old told Reuters.""When I left high school, I used to be quite an aggressive batter who played shots from ball one. But this long format found a whole new side to me which I never knew existed â€“ being patient and understanding the game better.""CLUB CRICKETThe country's economic woes hit cricket hardest at grassroots level.Harare's premier club competition, the Vigne Cup, featured four divisions at the turn of the century. Now it can only sustain two.As long-established clubs have slipped out of existence, the league has experienced a rise in the number of nomadic teams. Of the eight clubs in the first division, only two maintain their own venues. This has resulted in a phenomenon of having more teams than grounds to play on, which causes challenges for fixture fulfillment.""Here in Zimbabwe most clubs do not have grounds"", said Daniel Jakiel, 28, a fast bowler from the itinerant Rainbow Cricket Club.Teams like Rainbow rely on schools or the remaining established clubs, Takashinga and Old Hararians, making their facilities available.""Some of the clubs, they came from their own areas so they have their grounds. But some of the clubs, like us, we are based in Harare town so we don't have a ground yet.""Jakiel, who works as a legal clerk, acknowledges the sacrifice that club cricketers must make in a country with more than 80 percent unemployment.""It's difficult sometimes, but I have to try to manage my time and balance my practise and work"", he said.""Some of the players, they might have problems (with) transport and kit as well. Here it's difficult to buy kit when you are not working. So those are some of the challenges they face, most players.""Despite the hardships that players at all levels face, their unwavering love of cricket serves as a beacon of hope for the future of the game in Zimbabwe.

"WELLINGTON — New Zealand Cricket have cancelled their under-19 team's scheduled tour of Bangladesh in the wake of last month's mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch.The decision had been reached with agreement of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, NZC Chairman Greg Barclay said in a statement on Monday.Barclay added that both NZC and the BCB had agreed that proceeding with the April tour would be ""insensitive and inappropriate"" so soon after the shooting that left 50 people dead.Several of the victims of the March 15 attack were originally from Bangladesh.The south Asian nation's senior men's cricket team also narrowly avoided being caught up in the shooting as a number of their players headed to one of the mosques for Friday prayers before the third test against New Zealand.The third test, which had been scheduled to start at nearby Hagley Oval the following day, was cancelled and the Bangladesh team left the country.""We have conveyed our deep sense of regret over the circumstances leading to this mutual decision, and the BCB have been both understanding and generous in response,"" Barclay said.""NZC have nothing but respect for the BCB and believe this development has only served to bring our countries closer together, and to strengthen our bond through cricket.""

"(Reuters) - Afghanistan replaced long-serving one-day international captain Asghar Afghan with Gulbadin Naib on Friday, less than two months before this year's 50-over World Cup in England and Wales.Afghan, 31, took over the team's captaincy in 2015 after Mohammad Nabi had stepped down following the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.Under his leadership, the war-torn South Asian country gained full membership status from the governing body International Cricket Council and also qualified for the 2019 World Cup.Afghanistan's chief selector Dawalt Ahmadzai backed Naib to continue Afghan's legacy and said he was the right choice to lead the team at the World Cup.""Asghar Afghan who captained team Afghanistan for a period of around four years achieved a lot and made the country proud,"" Ahmadzai said in a statement on the Afghan Cricket Board's (ACB) website https://www.cricket.af/acb-news-info/960.""I hope Gulbadin Naib will be able to continue his legacy at the helm of the team's affairs.""However, the news did not go down well with Afghan's predecessor Nabi, who took to Twitter to question the timing of the change.""Being a senior member of the side and having seen the rise of Afghanistan cricket, I don't think it's the right time to change the captain before the WC,"" Nabi said.""The team has gelled really well under Asghar and I personally feel he is the right man to lead us.""The 28-year-old Naib, who bowls seam and bats in the middle order, has played 52 ODIs for Afghanistan since making his debut in 2011.In wholesale changes to the leadership structure, all-rounder Rahmat Shah was appointed test captain replacing Afghan while leg-spinner Rashid Khan was put in charge of the Twenty20 team.Rashid, who was also named vice-captain for the 50-over format, was even more vocal in his criticism of the move and called the decision to oust Afghan ""irresponsible"".""With all the respect to the selection committee, I strongly disagree with the decision,"" Rashid said on Twitter. ""As we have the cricket World Cup in front of us...

"(Reuters) - Former Australian bowler and influential coach Bruce Yardley died on Wednesday at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer.Playing at a time when the test landscape was dominated by fast-bowlers, Yardley started out as a medium-pacer himself before switching to off-spin midway through his career and earned his test debut for Australia at the age of 30.Using a distinctive long run-up better associated with pace bowling and employing his middle finger rather than his index finger to get the ball to turn, Yardley went on to take 126 wickets for Australia in 33 test matches.He also picked up 344 wickets in a first class career that spanned 24 years.""Bruce was a significant figure in Australian cricket, contributing in many ways on and off the field,"" Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said in a statement.""As a player, it took him more than 10 years of persistence playing first class and Premier cricket to find the art of off-spin, earning him a test debut at the age of 30.""Off the field, Bruce had an infectious personality and was regarded as one of the best spin-bowing coaches in the world, coaching Sri Lanka and mentoring the greatest test wicket-taker of all time, Muttiah Muralitharan.""Yardley coached the Sri Lankan team in the late 1990s and defended Muralitharan when the Sri Lankan, who has a record 800 test wickets, was investigated for having an illegal action in 2004.""Very sad to hear about the passing of Bruce Yardley,"" former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said on Twitter.

"MELBOURNE — Steve Smith and David Warner may wake with some relief on Thursday as they greet the final day of their ball-tampering bans but the anniversary of their humiliation will otherwise be a sombre milestone for Australia's cricket fans.Much has changed since Cricket Australia slapped former captain Smith and his deputy Warner with 12-month suspensions for the Cape Town scandal, while giving Cameron Bancroft a lighter nine-month sentence as the rookie opener caught up in a plot driven by others.Captains, coaches and a string of senior cricket executives have left or been sent packing, their replacements pledging to win back fans with fair play as much as series wins and silverware.Bancroft, the man who hastily trousered a piece of sandpaper in the Newlands field to try to hide his team's shame, has been named captain of English county side Durham, three months after fingering Warner as the ball-tampering mastermind in a TV interview in December.The more circumspect Warner has largely kept his counsel while returning to one of cricket's biggest stages at the Indian Premier League, smashing 85 in a 53-ball blitz in his first outing for Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday.Smith also returned to the IPL spotlight in defeat for the Rajasthan Royals, joining Warner on a mission to reclaim a spot in the one-day international team he once captained in the leadup to the showpiece World Cup in England.Efforts to smooth the pair's rehabilitation have been in train for months, and culminated in a reunion with Aaron Finch's squad in the United Arab Emirates a week-and-a-half ago.""There were a lot of big hugs and cuddles,"" Warner said in a curated video published by Cricket Australia. ""It's like we didn't really leave, the boys were very accepting of us coming in and with open arms.""Pundits have questioned whether all is really forgiven in a playing group who were left to rebuild Australia's shattered brand and absorb a series of humbling defeats without two of their best batsmen.Yet none of the players have expressed reservations and many have argued Smith and Warner have ""done their time"".""It'd be silly not to use them,"" Finch said of the pair who boast over 200 matches and 22 centuries between them in one-day internationals.Smith and Warner's former team mates may have already moved on but fans the world over have not forgotten Cape Town.Sections of the Jaipur crowd jeered Smith when he played for Rajasthan on Monday, and he and Warner can expect heat from English crowds should they play at the World Cup.The hyper-aggressive teams they once led now have a very different timbre.The ugly verbal attacks and off-field confrontation that blighted the South Africa test series have disappeared, with Paine-led Australia hosting test series against India and Sri Lanka in good spirit over the home summer.Governing body Cricket Australia (CA) was also shaken by Cape Town, with a slew of executives leaving or shown the door after a scathing cultural review.New CA boss Kevin Roberts has treaded carefully since taking over from long-serving CEO James Sutherland in October, while trying to shift Australia's focus forward rather than backward.""It was a year on Sunday since the shattering events of Cape Town. The public outcry was really confronting, but it also reinforced how much the game means to so many people,"" Roberts said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday.""In relation to Australia's men's and women's teams, our goal will always be to win, but we now have a non-negotiable expectation to compete with respect and strive to win with honour.""With the one-day World Cup starting end May and the Ashes in August, winning may be Australia's best hope of banishing the ghosts of Newlands, with or without the help of Smith and Warner.

"(Reuters) - England's Jos Buttler has vowed to make sure he is never dismissed by a ""Mankad"" run out again after losing his wicket that way for the second time in his career during an Indian Premier League (IPL) game last week.The Rajasthan Royals batsman was run out on 69 while backing up at the non-striker's end as Kings XI Punjab's Ravichandran Ashwin chose to whip off the bails instead of completing his delivery as Buttler stepped out of the crease.The 28-year-old was dismissed the same way when England played Sri Lanka in 2014, although in that case spinner Sachithra Senanayake had warned Buttler twice for backing up too far.""I must be the only person to get out twice in that way. I'll make sure it never happens again,"" Buttler told the Daily Mirror.""I didn't like what happened and I didn't agree with it, but what can you do?""The dismissal, named after India bowler Vinoo Mankad who ran out Australia's Bill Brown in similar fashion in 1947, is permitted under cricket's laws but viewed by many as going against the spirit of the game.The Marylebone Cricket Club, the authority on the laws of cricket, said the dismissal was not ""within the spirit of the game"" after reviewing footage of the incident.""I was really disappointed with it, I didn't like the style of it,"" Buttler added. ""I just thought it was a bad precedent at the start of the tournament.""What was more disappointing is that suddenly over the next two games I found myself being really conscious of it and it's quite distracting.""I think if you look at the footage, probably the wrong decision was made because at the time he was expected to release the ball I was in my crease.""Buttler, who has made two fifties in the IPL this season, is back in action when the Royals take on Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday.

"MELBOURNE — Injury troubles have kept James Pattinson out of the Australian test side for three years but the fast bowler issued a timely reminder to selectors ahead of the Ashes as he guided Victoria to their fourth Sheffield Shield title in five years on Sunday.Having grabbed three wickets in the first innings against Queensland, the Melbourne man tore through the top order in a devastating spell, his match haul of 7-71 leaving him with 26 wickets at an average of 18.92 for the competition.With first-choice quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood battling injuries, 28-year-old Pattinson will look to continue his revival when he heads to England to play for Nottinghamshire in the county championship.Once seen as a potential 100-test player, Pattinson returned to first class cricket for the first time in 15 months in November having undergone major back surgery.The paceman played the last of his 17 tests away to New Zealand in February 2016 but has remained patient and determined through a number of injury setbacks.""It's been a journey to get to this position over the last few years and at times I thought I would never be back,"" said Pattinson, who has suffered a litany of back problems and soft tissue injuries through his stop-start career.""I never doubted my ability when I could get back and bowl.""All the hard work, all the doubts that creep in to your mind, these are times that make it worth it.""Selector Trevor Hohns was at Melbourne's Junction Oval to watch the Shield final and would have likely been impressed by the performance of the once-menacing Pattinson, who has 70 test wickets at an average of 26.15.""We'd love to see him (with Victoria) for every game but I think he deserves to be with the big boys as opposed to playing with us,"" said Victoria captain Travis Dean.Test cricket would be a big step up from the loads bowled in Shield cricket, and Pattinson will have to get through the county season unscathed to be considered for the Ashes starting in August.""They have never really had an issue with the way I bowl, it's just about staying on the park,"" Pattinson said of the national selectors.""I need to get through a few more games ... The test will come once I start bowling more. I have spoken to the selectors in recent times about the Ashes and that's my goal."" (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford)"
"MELBOURNE — Australia bowling coach Troy Cooley has no plans to carry on the role full-time after this year's Ashes series and expects to head back to his usual job at the national cricket academy after plotting England's downfall.Cooley, who helped England win back the urn in the memorable 2005 series, left his post as head bowling coach at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane to join the Australian camp for the recent one-day series against Pakistan and India.Although announced as bowling coach for the Ashes last week, Cooley confirmed he would be in the role for a good time, not a long time.""Ashes, it gets me out of bed in the morning,"" the 53-year-old said in Dubai, where Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash of Pakistan on Sunday.""It's one of the best jobs going around.""You could not pass up an opportunity like this.""But I would probably be more inclined to continue the (NCC) head coaching role.""Cooley replaced David Saker, Australia's last full-time bowling coach, for the India and Pakistan ODI series, but governing body Cricket Australia have yet to decide on a long-term appointment.As one of the principal architects of England's droughtbreaking 2-1 series win in 2005, Cooley's involvement is a boost for an Australian team hoping to claim the urn on English soil for the first time since 2001.He said reverse swing might not have as much of an impact on the series as it had in 2005 because of stadium upgrades.""It really depends on Mother Nature,"" Cooley said.""We'll exploit that if we get an opportunity to, depending on the conditions.""But a lot of English grounds now have got irrigation and been redone, so you don't have those real dry outfields like in '05.""Even with first choice quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood currently injured, Australia are unlikely to be short of quality pacemen.Cooley said Australia's whole attack would need to be versatile to have success in England when the series gets underway in August.""The fast bowlers and the spinners have got to work as a team and I know 'JL' (head coach Justin Langer) is really keen to make sure that pack mentality is tight and they're covering all bases,"" he said.""So if we rock up and get a green seamer or a dry one we've got enough skillset and enough coverage to be able to take 20 wickets.""

"(Reuters) - Australia's top four batsmen all posted half-centuries as they beat Pakistan by 20 runs to complete a 5-0 one-day series whitewash in Dubai on Sunday.Sent out to bat, Australia finished with a commanding total of 327-7 on a flat Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch.Opener Usman Khawaja was all set for his third hundred this month but fell for 98 to fast bowler Usman Shinwari.Glenn Maxwell, meanwhile, celebrated his 100th one-day international with an impressive 33-ball 70, Shaun Marsh scored 68-ball 61 and captain Aaron Finch made 69-ball 53 to put Australia in control at halfway stage.It was Maxwell's third consecutive 50-plus score, giving him a timely boost in intense competition for the middle-order spots for the World Cup starting on May 30 in England and Wales.Khawaja and Finch laid the foundations with a solid 134-run opening stand but it was Maxwell's 10 fours and three sixes that helped Australia to 107 runs in the last 10 overs.Pakistan lost opener Abid Ali, who scored a century on debut in the last match, for a golden duck in the first over but Shan Masood and Haris Sohail got the run chase on track with a steady partnership of 108 for the second wicket.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa celebrated his 27th birthday by trapping Masood (50) leg-before to give Australia a crucial breakthrough, before Maxwell's off-spin removed Mohammad Rizwan for 12.Sohail smashed his second century of the series but holed out to paceman Kane Richardson for 130 when the run-rate pressure forced him to go for broke in the 41st over.Captain Imad Wasim scored an unbeaten 50 to reduce the deficit but the task proved too big for Pakistan who finished 307-7 after 50 overs.""It's very satisfying,"" said Australia coach Justin Langer.""We came here in September and Pakistan showed us how to play cricket (with 3-0 Twenty20 series win). We worked really hard in the summer to turn it around, and 5-0 is a great result.""Everyone in world cricket is working towards the World Cup, and it's always nice to go into the tournament with confidence.

"MUMBAI — David Warner celebrated the end of his year-long ban from international cricket with a match-winning innings of 69 on Friday, helping his Indian Premier League franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad overhaul a steep target against the Rajasthan Royals.Former Australia captain Steve Smith and his deputy Warner were slapped with 12-month suspensions from international cricket last year for their involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in the Cape Town test against South Africa.Two months out from the World Cup in England, Warner showed he had lost none of his marauding form at the top of the order by smashing 85 in 53 balls in Hyderabad's opening IPL match against Kolkata Knight Riders last Sunday.He continued in the same vein against Rajasthan, the day after his international ban ended, scoring 69 off 37 deliveries as his team chased down their opponents 198-2, built on Sanju Samson's unbeaten knock of 102.Hyderabad needed a fast start to their innings and Warner, who missed the 2018 IPL because of the ban, obliged with a half-century off 26 deliveries.""We got off to a good start and kept (going) on with that adrenaline,"" Warner said after the match. ""As a batsman when your adrenaline is running you are in a mood.""Warner's form is timely as he attempts to win a place in Aaron Finch's World Cup squad, four years after being Australia's second-highest run scorer behind former captain Smith during the team's run to the title on home soil.Finch said on Thursday selectors would find it hard to fit everyone in to the 15-man squad, with his current one-day side resurgent as they dominate Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.However, Glenn Maxwell, who struck 98 as Australia completed a six-run win over Pakistan in Dubai on Friday, said he looked forward to Warner and Smith joining the ODI squad.""He's on fire over there and it's good to see, looking forward to them joining up with us,"" said Maxwell after Australia took a 4-0 lead in the five-match series.""They're certainly going to get plenty of cricket over there in the IPL.""Left-hander Warner hit nine fours, three of them in England all-rounder Ben Stokes' first over, and two sixes in his knock and by the time he fell to Stokes, his team had already rocketed to 110 in less than 10 overs. ""When a player like David Warner bats like that, there's very less margin as a bowler,"" Rajasthan captain Ajinkya Rahane said.""I don't think the bowlers did anything wrong, their batsmen did very well. They didn't lose any momentum throughout when they were batting.""Smith did not have an opportunity to bat as his side promoted Stokes ahead of him at number four.

""This is first time going into a World Cup England have such a settled squad. Everything looks great from the outside, they have every option covered.""England failed to cope with raised expectations at the 2017 Champions Trophy when they lost to eventual winners Pakistan in the semi-finals.Cook is positive such blips can only make a team mentally stronger.Since the start of last year, England have come out on top in bilateral ODI series against World Cup holders Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India.""They had that blip in the (2017) Champions Trophy, where they lost in the semi-final to Pakistan when they were favourites, but you need those lows to be able to grow as a side,"" he added.""They are favourites. This is a great opportunity for Eoin (Morgan) and the guys to play some fantastic cricket.

"NEW DELHI — Former captain Steve Smith laid to rest any concerns about his fitness and form ahead of the naming of Australia's World Cup squad with his first half century of this year's Indian Premier League on Sunday.The 29-year-old Smith, who underwent elbow surgery earlier this year, top-scored with 73 not out for Rajasthan Royals in their relatively meagre total of 139 for three in Jaipur.Smith's innings lasted just 59 balls but he was relatively circumspect at the start against some tight bowling from spinners Piyush Chawla and Sunil Narine. West Indies all-rounder Narine (47) then combined with Australia's Chris Lynn (50) in a 91-run opening partnership in 8.1 overs to set up an eight-wicket victory with 37 balls to spare. Despite the loss, Smith's innings would have pleased Australia's selectors as they mull over their squad for the defence of the one-day World Cup in England and Wales.Instead of a traditional all-out attacking innings normal in the Twenty20 format, Smith worked the ball into gaps and had scored just 39 runs from his first 40 balls before he accelerated in the final overs.The innings drew some praise from West Indies batting great Brian Lara during the commentary of the match.""He is not a big-hitter of the ball,"" Lara said. ""He's not an Andre Russell or a Ben Stokes. He gets the gaps. I respect him.""Former England captain Michael Vaughan also tweeted that a six by Smith off Narine would put to bed any concerns over the elbow.Smith's 12-month international ban for ball tampering only ended 10 days ago and he has started slowly with scores of 20, 28 and 38 in his three matches before Sunday's innings.He had been playing mostly Twenty20 tournaments around the world during the ban. He also played club cricket in Sydney before having the surgery.Both Smith and former Australia vice-captain David Warner missed last year's IPL following the imposition of the bans by Cricket Australia for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked their national team.Australia are expected to name their team for the defence of their World Cup title over the next week, with the 15-man squads needing to be finalised by April 23.India captain Virat Kohli's miserable IPL season continued on Sunday when his Royal Challengers Bangalore lost to the Delhi Capitals by four wickets, their sixth defeat in six matches this season.

"CAPE TOWN — South Africa coach Ottis Gibson knows the players he wants to travel to England for the Cricket World Cup, but injuries and loss of form have complicated his 15-man selection.South Africa, who are due to name their squad on April 18, have not lost a 50-over series in the last 12 months, winning home and away against Sri Lanka, in Australia, and at home to Pakistan and Zimbabwe.Captain Faf du Plessis has previously described what they see as their blueprint for success -- six specialist batsmen, an all-rounder at number seven, three fast bowlers and a spinner.The bowling lineup picks itself with Imran Tahir providing his controlled leg-spin, and a seam attack of Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, and one of veteran Dale Steyn or newcomer Anrich Nortje.Ngidi (side strain) and Nortje (shoulder) are currently out with injuries though, missing the Indian Premier League, and both have a history of breaking down in the recent past.""I've had 15 (players in mind) for a while now, but we've got to sit with fingers crossed,"" Gibson recently told reporters.""We've asked the guys who have gone off (to the IPL) to make sure that they still remember what the biggest picture is with regards to the Proteas setup. ""We have a camp on May 12, and we want to make sure that there are no niggling injuries. We don't want to be taking injuries into a World Cup, so hopefully that will take care of itself.""Opening batsman Hashim Amla has been a stalwart at the top of the order for the last decade, but his form in all formats has been called into question in the past year.In ODI cricket he has managed a single century in his previous 16 innings, dating back to the start of 2018, at an average of 35.26. Counting in his favour though is an impressive average of 63.44 in England.Those who have been given a run of games to contest his opening spot, Reeza Hendricks and Aiden Markram, have not grasped their opportunities despite hugely impressive domestic form. There are also questions over the number three position, with the same duo also in contention for that along with the inexperienced, but in-form, Rassie van der Dussen.Dussen made his debut less than three months ago but could be asked to play a pivotal role in one of the key batting positions in the lineup.JP Duminy, who provides a second spin option as well as being a frontline batsman, is undergoing strength training on a troublesome shoulder.

"MUMBAI — The Indian Premier League clash between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians turned out to be an engrossing contest on Thursday but it was marred by an umpiring error on the last delivery that left Virat Kohli fuming.Bangalore, led by the talismanic India skipper, needed a six off the last delivery to tie the match against Mumbai but batsman Shivam Dube could only hit Lasith Malinga's full-length delivery to long-on to lose by six runs.Replays showed the Sri Lanka fast bowler had clearly overstepped the crease for a no-ball, meaning a free hit for Bangalore.""We are playing at IPL level, not club cricket,"" a livid Kohli said at the post-match presentation. ""That's just a ridiculous call off the last ball. The umpires should have their eyes open, it was a no-ball by an inch. ""It's a completely different game altogether (with the extra delivery). So if it's a game of margins, I don't know what's happening. They should have been more sharp and more careful out there.""The no-ball would have resulted in an extra run for Bangalore and brought former South Africa batsman AB de Villiers on strike. De Villers was in scintillating form and unbeaten on 70 off 41 balls with half a dozen sixes and four fours.Thursday's loss was the second in as many matches for the Kohli-led side while Mumbai picked up their first victory.Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma, who is Kohli's deputy in India's limited-overs sides, was also unimpressed with the umpiring gaffe.""These kinds of mistakes are not good for the game of cricket,"" Sharma said. ""The players can't do much about it... but I hope they can rectify their mistakes like we do.""It's pretty simple, those decisions can cost you games. We prepare too much to win this tournament, to win games, and those kind of mistakes are not acceptable.""The controversy comes days after Ravichandran Ashwin's 'Mankad' dismissal of Jos Buttler in a match between Rajasthan and Punjab caused uproar.The tournament, however, is in rude health in terms of viewership, with the 12th edition set to surpass all previous records.

"MUMBAI — West Indies are replete with match-winners but consistency will be key to their success in English conditions at this year's World Cup, batting great Brian Lara has said.Teeming with tearaway fast bowlers and aggressive batsmen, West Indies were once considered invincible and won the opening two editions of the World Cup in 1975 and 1979.Their glory days, however, are long over and the twice winners had to go through a qualifying tournament to book their spot in the 10-team tournament in England and Wales.The last bilateral series win for West Indies, who are ranked ninth in one-day internationals, came in 2014 but they showed signs of improvement against England.Jason Holder's men drew a five-match ODI series against top-ranked England 2-2 at home recently, in a timely boost before the May 30-July 14 showpiece event.The likes of opening batsman Chris Gayle, all-rounder Andre Russell and spinner Sunil Narine are also much in demand in Twenty20 leagues across the globe.""Look at the Indian Premier League, look at the leagues around the world, we have got players that are the most wanted in the world,"" Lara, 49, told reporters in Mumbai at a promotional event last week.""We have got match-winners, but we are going to need a little more than match-winners in English conditions to win the World Cup. We need a team that can create consistency.""If we can get to the knock-out stages, we can knock out any team. We have seen that in the past. But consistency is going to take us right through to the finals.""Former West Indies captain Lara, considered one of the very best the Caribbean islands have ever produced, retired after the 2007 World Cup at home with over 10,000 runs in ODIs. He also scored close to 12,000 runs in tests.Lara credited franchise leagues like the IPL for creating interest among kids in the West Indies and giving young players a platform to showcase their talent before they graduate to international cricket.West Indies suffered 2-0 losses both in India and Bangladesh late last year but staged a spectacular turnaround in a 2-1 series win against England earlier this year.The test success augurs well for the side, who are now graduating to a level where they can be competitive against top sides at least at home, said Lara.""We had a tremendous series against England. We are laying the foundation, the confidence is there,"" Lara added. ""India may have to worry when they come there in July to play against the West Indies because they have a team now that understand the conditions, spirits are high, let's see what we can do against India.""But, four months ago in October-November we were terrible. So, I'm happy that we have made that little progress in our cricket."" (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"
"MUMBAI — India captain Virat Kohli does not want performance at the ongoing Indian Premier League to determine team composition for this year's World Cup but selectors have little choice after a series of candidates failed to nail down the number four slot.Twice 50-over champions India have an otherwise settled batting line-up with a formidable top order consisting of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli himself.The selectors, however, continue to fret over who should walk out to bat after the fall of the second wicket during the May 30-July 14 showpiece tournament in England and Wales.Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Lokesh Rahul, Dinesh Karthik and Ambati Rayudu have all been trialled for the number four spot and found wanting.With the ongoing IPL the only form of cricket left before Kohli's team embarks on their World Cup campaign, the selectors maybe forced to consider the form of the players in the T20 tournament before picking the squad ahead of the April 23 deadline.""They have maintained that they won't look at IPL but it's going to be very hard,"" former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar told Reuters in a recent interview. ""There are some borderline cases, like if they are looking at Dinesh Karthik, Ambati Rayudu and Vijay Shankar or a Manish Pandey or an Ajinkya Rahane. So all these people are there and thereabout.""And if somebody has a great IPL season, it will be hard to ignore him, but they (selectors) should not actually get too carried away with what happens in the IPL.""Rayudu, 33, emerged as the most likely choice to fill the void but scores of 13, 18 and two in the first three matches of the recent home series against world champions Australia hurt his cause.Pressure is only mounting on the selectors with Rayudu, who plays for IPL champions Chennai Super Kings, scoring 28, five, one and zero in the first four matches of the tournament.Manjrekar felt India were back to square one with no more ODIs scheduled before the World Cup in England and Wales, where the team will be looking to add to their 1983 and 2011 triumphs.India's limited-overs vice-captain, Rohit, believes inputs from Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri should determine the selection of the final 15.""With their inputs, the selectors will keep an eye on what is happening with those guys during the IPL,"" Rohit, who leads the Mumbai Indians side in the IPL, told reporters at the launch of cricket.com website on Thursday. ""Although I feel IPL shouldn't be the criterion for team selection. We have played enough international matches to see where each individual stands.""You can't select a 50-overs format team based on a 20-overs franchise competition. IPL is a different ball game, it's franchise cricket.""Yes form matters a lot. But in this last four years we have played enough ODI matches, we have played enough T20 internationals.

"WELLINGTON — Less than 18 months ago, New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham had become so disaffected with cricket he would open the curtains on match day and hope it was raining.A timely chat with Heath Mills, the head of the New Zealand players' union, however, ended his thoughts about retirement and ultimately propelled him back into the national side and then on Wednesday into the country's World Cup squad.""Opening the shades and hoping it was raining is not the ideal way to begin a day of cricket,"" Neesham told reporters on Thursday, the day after he was named in the squad for the May 30-July 14 tournament in England. ""I think I needed to just have a full overhaul in the way I was approaching the game.""I actually called Heath Mills 18 months ago and told him I was going to retire. He convinced me to take a little break.""Luckily I took his advice ... and obviously since then it's been on the up and up.""With his ability to bat in the top order and bowl fast-medium pace, Neesham was once considered to be the answer to New Zealand's search for an all-rounder when he made the side in late 2012.The early stages of his career were hampered by injury, however, and in 2017 a decline with the ball saw him dropped from the national side. The following year he was removed from the central contracts list, with the message from selector Gavin Larsen that he needed to ""demand our attention again"".The power-hitting left-hander tried to respond by pushing himself to score more runs, but only piled more pressure on himself. ""I wanted to dominate and score hundreds every game and once that starts going in a downward spiral and you're not going well, you put more pressure on yourself,"" he said.""When I was the most driven, I played my worst. Trying too hard doesn't seem to help as a cricketer. ""Once I got over those feelings and began to enjoy myself again then that's when things started to get better.""Part of that process involved leaving Otago, where he had spent seven years, and move to Wellington where coach Bruce Edgar, captain Michael Bracewell and former New Zealand pace bowler Hamish Bennett all helped him regain his confidence.Since being recalled to the national side in January, the 28-year-old has played eight one-day internationals in his comeback and scored 204 runs at an average of 68, while taking 10 wickets at 22.90, enough to convince selectors he should be on the plane for England.""It was a long road back, but once I got back to scoring runs and taking wickets I knew I wasn't too far away if I put a good couple of months together,"" he added.""But to get the call, it's pretty surreal.""

"WELLINGTON — Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell was the surprise selection in New Zealand's 15-man squad for cricket's one-day World Cup later this year, despite never having played the format at international level.The 28-year-old Blundell has played just two tests, making a century on debut, and three Twenty20 internationals for New Zealand, but will serve as a backup to Tom Latham for the May 30-July 14 tournament in England and Wales.""The key for us was finding the right balance for the squad and making sure we had our bases covered for what is going to be a very competitive World Cup,"" coach Gary Stead said.""As a one-day unit we've been pretty consistent over the past few years and possess a very experienced group of core players, proven at the top level.""Blundell's last appearance for New Zealand was in a Twenty20 international against Australia in Sydney in early 2018. He did not play a single game for Wellington in New Zealand's domestic one-day competition this season.His surprise elevation into the squad is at the expense of Tim Seifert, who had been the preferred wicketkeeper in Twenty20 internationals this summer and made his one-day international debut in January against Sri Lanka.The aggressive Seifert, who can bat up and down the order, showed his potential with quickfire scores of 84 and 43 while opening against India in Twenty20 internationals in February, but broke his finger towards the end of the season.While he would have recovered for the World Cup, questions had been asked about his work with the gloves and Stead had said he would prefer to select a specialist to back up Latham, who only assumed the role in the one-day squad two years ago.Henry Nicholls had been previously mooted as a potential emergency wicketkeeper if Latham got injured, but is now expected to open the batting with Martin Guptill after Colin Munro fell out of favour.Munro still made the final 15-man squad with his ability to also bowl medium pace but is more likely to be batting cover.Ish Sodhi also won a tight selection battle with Todd Astle as the second spinner, with all-rounder Mitchell Santner the first-choice slow bowler.The choice of Sodhi over Astle was considered a far from straightforward selection battle, with both legspinners given opportunities to prove themselves in white-ball cricket over New Zealand's summer.Astle is the stronger batsman but Sodhi is considered the more attacking bowler and took 24 wickets at 21.17 in his final three first-class games in March.James Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme were named as the all-rounders, while the four frontline pace bowlers Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry were never in doubt.Squad: Kane Williamson (captain), Tom Blundell, Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Colin Munro, James Neesham, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor.

"(Reuters) - Sri Lanka's test captain Dimuth Karunaratne has apologised for his actions in a drink-driving accident that injured one person in Colombo and led to the cricketer's arrest on Sunday.The injured driver was later discharged and Karunaratne was released on bail, with Sri Lanka Cricket stating they would conduct their own inquiry into the incident.""I firstly need to apologise to the owner of the other vehicle who had a few very minor injuries and was absolutely decent in his manner to very amicably sort out the matter directly with me,"" Karunaratne said in a statement on Monday.""I... would like to inform all of you that he has been discharged from hospital where he was under precautionary observation and is now resting at home.""This morning I produced myself in court and did follow the due legal process of Sri Lanka and did abide by all formalities therein required. I shall continue to assist/follow with what ever legal obligations are necessary from my end.""I'm very much aware that perhaps my actions were utterly unbecoming of a Sri Lankan national cricketer and I do apologise to all of you for this incident.""Karunaratne was Sri Lanka's captain when they became the first Asian team to win a test series in South Africa last month.

"(Reuters) - Jason Behrendorff marked his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut with two wickets on Wednesday but the Australian fast bowler knows he needs to deliver consistently to stake a claim for a Cricket World Cup spot.Mumbai Indians' Behrendorff removed Chennai Super Kings opener Ambati Rayudu and Suresh Raina with the new ball to help his side cruise to a 37-run victory.With fellow left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc expected to return to full-fitness for the World Cup, and Australia's wealth of options in the fast bowling department, Behrendorff's path to the tournament in England and Wales is far from straightforward.""My (World Cup) spot is not certainly cemented down, that's for sure,"" Behrendorff told reporters. ""Any performance here can really help me out.""My main strength is swinging the new ball up front and taking some wickets. It was good that I was able to do that tonight and keep that in front of selectors' minds... that I am still bowling well.""Behrendorff, who has 14 wickets in a short international career of 13 limited-overs matches, took a career-best 3-63 as Australia completed a 5-0 one-day series whitewash of Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.

"(Reuters) - England Women smashed over 200 runs for only the second time in a Twenty20 international as they beat Sri Lanka to complete a 3-0 series whitewash in Colombo on Thursday.Danielle Wyatt made 33-ball 51 and fellow opener Amy Jones scored 57, while Natalie Sciver and Tammy Beaumont stitched an unbroken 88-run partnership for the third wicket in the tourists' 204-2.It was England's second-highest total in the shortest format of the game behind only the world record 250-3 scored against South Africa Women last June in Taunton.Only three Sri Lankans reached double figures as they laboured to 108-6 in 20 overs, handing England a 96-run victory.The win was England's 10th in a row as they complete a successful tour of India and Sri Lanka.England were 2-0 down in the one-day series in India but won the dead rubber and went on to clinch the T20 series 3-0.Heather Knight's side continued their run of clinical performances to beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in the one-dayers that preceded the T20 clean sweep.""We talked about imposing ourselves on Sri Lanka and be quite ruthless,"" England coach Mark Robinson told the England and Wales Cricket Board website.""You've got to keep you standards as the games go on and these girls have been fantastic.""England will next host West Indies in June before taking on rivals Australia in the Women's Ashes series.

"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.There's a lot going on in Washington and the world this week, but there's also still a lot of buzz around the Green New Deal, a proposal put forth by Democrats that would reshape the American energy sector to tackle climate change and create jobs.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has said he'll bring the proposal to a vote in the coming months, a move that could force Democratic senators who are running for president to choose sides.Young people who follow the Sunrise Movement, an environmental group, have protested at government offices in recent days to demand that lawmakers vote in favor of the proposal. About 40 young people, some holding a sign saying â€œMitch, look us in the eyes,â€ were arrested Monday while holding a sit-in at Mr. McConnell's Washington office. They and other critics have denounced the vote as a ploy to divide Democrats and throw cold water on the notion of an ambitious climate plan.But activists aren't focusing solely on Republicans. Last week a group of schoolchildren confronted Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, over her resistance to the Green New Deal. Ms. Feinstein — who has a 100 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks lawmakers' environmental records — told the students the Green New Deal had little chance of passing a Republican-led Senate. Video of the encounter spread quickly on social media.For a deep dive into both the political perils of the Green New Deal and the technological hurdles of decarbonizing the United States economy, check out this piece that Trip Gabriel and I did last week. And if you're confused about what the Green New Deal is, I try to offer answers to some basic questions here.In other news, the White House announced last week that it had ended talks with California on whether the state could retain its right to set stricter automobile emissions standards than the federal government.The breakdown of negotiations, Hiroko Tabuchi and I reported, signals that the Trump administration is moving toward freezing an Obama-era rule that would have doubled fuel economy standards by 2025.And in the world of science, be sure not to miss this piece by Kendra Pierre-Louis on how extreme weather can start to feel â€¦ well, not all that extreme. Happy reading!For those of us hooked on the Netflix show â€œTidying Up with Marie Kondo,â€ this has been a season of decluttering. (If you haven't caught the bug yet, consider taking The Times's Tidy Home Challenge).But when you clear the closets of the stuff that no longer sparks joy, or simply doesn't fit, you are confronted with a pile of possessions in need of a new home. It may be tempting to take the junk to the dump, leave it on the curb or hand off a mass of unsorted goods to a charity that may not want or need them.Do the planet a favor instead. Many items can be sold, donated or recycled properly, giving them another life that will be better for the environment.Consider textiles, which accounted for 6.1 percent of municipal waste generated in the United States in 2015, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2015, Americans recycled 2.5 million tons of textiles, but sent 10.5 million tons to landfills.â€œMost people think, â€˜O.K., my clothing is stained, it's garbage,' â€ said Zach Cohen, owner of the Manhattan and Brooklyn franchises of Junkluggers, a hauling company. But there are textile companies that will take clothing, rugs and â€œanything that is made out of fabric and reuse it and recycle it,â€ he said.Your tattered towels and worn-out socks, for example, can get new life as upholstery filler or insulation.To help get your stuff to the right place, call the charity of your choice and find out what items it accepts. Some accept goods in poor condition for recycling, while others only want what's suitable for resale.You can also try specialized organizations, like Books Through Bars, a Philadelphia group that gives paperbacks to people in prison.You could donate used bras to the Bra Recyclers, which has a drop-off locator on its website. Even an old mattress need not end up in a landfill. Bye Bye Mattress, for example, recycles mattresses in some states.Have a pair of shoes you've hardly worn? Donate them to an organization like Soles4Souls. And Habitat for Humanity collects old furniture, appliances and even building materials.Other lightly used possessions may still have value, if you have the patience to sell them online.Contact your local sanitation department to find out how your city would like you to dispose of hazardous materials like latex paint, batteries and fluorescent light bulbs. Many communities have drop-off days.Even those items most likely destined for the curb, like broken appliances, may have life yet as scrap metal. The more stuff you can keep out of the landfill, the better.I've baked a lot of bread over the years, from basic Irma Rombauer white loaves to Tassajara sponge whole-wheat sourdoughs. But until a few weeks ago I had never baked cricket bread.As in, bread with ground-up crickets.Eating insects is common in many parts of the planet (the United Nations estimates that roughly one-third of the world's population consumes them, and they are offered as street food in Mexico, Thailand and other countries), but it hasn't fully caught on in the United States. Chefs are experimenting, and companies like Hotlix and EntoVida are making snacks and other products from grasshoppers, worms and other insects. (Can I interest you in a bag of mixed bugs?)There are several qualities that may make insects attractive to consumers. They pack a lot of protein and other nutrients per ounce, more than beef and some other protein sources. And they get good marks from a sustainability and climate perspective — they convert feed to protein very efficiently, use little water and produce only tiny amounts of greenhouse gases. (Unlike cattle, insects emit little to no methane.)But for many people there's an ick factor to eating them whole. To overcome that, some companies are trying other means to get crickets into our diet.That's the case with Seek Food, a small New York City company. Seek sells cricket granola and other snacks, but it also sells flour mixes, including the one I used, â€œall-purpose,â€ which combines standard wheat flour with ground crickets. â€œIt's an entry-level approach to eating crickets,â€ said Robyn Shapiro, the company's founder and chief executive.Ms. Shapiro declined to say exactly how much cricket flour her mix contains, but said it was less than 25 percent. The resulting flour has 40 percent more protein than wheat flour alone.In case you're wondering, Seek's crickets (the house cricket, or Acheta domesticus) are raised by a Texas company in stainless steel tubs. They don't need much light or water, but the warmer the environment, the faster they grow. The bugs are fed an all-grain diet but they are not that picky — they can subsist on scraps or other food waste. â€œCrickets are omnivores,â€ Ms. Shapiro said.After about six weeks, the insects are frozen until they are dead. Then they're dried and milled.The flour comes in a 12-ounce bag with a recipe on the back — a standard one that calls for yeast, sugar, water, salt and oil to make a basic loaf. The flour was darker than wheat flour, and had an odor that reminded me of malted milk powder. It mixed with the other ingredients easily, and the dough was light and easy to knead.The recipe called for eight to 10 minutes of kneading, and I could understand why. Crickets don't have any gluten, so it's important to fully develop the gluten in the wheat flour to get the dough stretchy enough for proper rising.The bread that resulted was fairly dark as well, but had a decent texture. I brought it to the office so my Climate colleagues could try it with butter and jam. It was actually pretty tasty. I'd almost call it normal. Almost.We'd love your feedback on this newsletter.

"A. The approximately 25,000 to 30,000 different species of orchid evolved along with their many pollinators — from bees, wasps and flies, to moths, butterflies, a cricket and even the occasional bird. Many of the plant's special shapes accommodate just one pollinator or a closely related group of pollinators. The flower may mimic the female of a pollinating insect, for example.Orchids make up about 10 percent of all extant flower types, but their genome suggests that they all descended from a common ancestor. These descendants developed a special deck of genetic cards that can be reshuffled to produce many variations of their characteristic flower plan. The plan involves bilateral symmetry, rather than radial symmetry; protective sepals alternating with petals; and usually a special lower petal, called a lip, that can serve as a landing pad for pollinators.Scientists say that this strategy is well suited to efficient pollen transfer, and can be adapted through evolution to attract different pollinators.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"
"Good morning. I started writing this newsletter in the weird liminal space between Australia and the United States, caught in the 24-hour miasma that haunts the travel home. I was living in the moment, but what moment it was, what day, what hour, was a mystery. Occasionally there was food, and I ate it; water, and I drank it. Sleep came and then vanished. It was a Sofia Coppola film stuck in turnaround. The script needed work.I thought about cooking a lot, how I couldn't wait to get back to the kitchen and boogie: a Reuben to eat with a cold beer; some fire-tingly Chinese lamb burgers to share with the family while the dog lolls beneath our feet; a green okonomiyaki to split with my wife; some sheet-pan chicken fajitas (above) to feed the kids and their friends.So there's that. But now that I'm back home, I'd like to make a freestyle chicken Parm as well, eat it with a glass of stringent red, try to explain this story I saw in Sydney about the pressure some are bringing on the International Cricket Council to adopt one brand of cricket ball for Test matches between countries. There are lots of new words and phrases to consider there. Leg spinner!I'd like to make bananas Foster bread pudding, if only because it asserts an excellence in American dessert and I haven't had it in ages. Also: Melissa Clark's recipe for an omelet mousseline, into which I'd like to fold some sea urchin just as if my name were Riad Nasr or Lee Hanson. What a meal that would be! Please try it in my name.Samin Nosrat's Roman egg drop soup? Francis Lam's caramelized scallions, to stir into noodles? Julia Moskin's chicken francese? Yotam Ottolenghi's one-pan pasta with harissa Bolognese? All those, too.There are many thousands more recipes to cook this week waiting for you on NYT Cooking.

"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Amid the unpredictable swirl of this year's tennis results, with 33 different champions in 33 tournaments, Ashleigh Barty provides a change of pace.The crafty 5-foot-5 Australian mixes backhand slices and drop shots with a deceptively strong serve and a knack for attacking, which is how she won the Miami Open.Barty had a career-high 15 aces and became the newest 2019 titlist on the ATP and WTA circuits by beating Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (1), 6-3 Saturday.That means there still has not been a repeat champion this year among the men or women.""Amazing, isn't it?"" Barty said. ""On the women's side, I think the level has evened out a lot, and the depth has grown over the last few years. Everyone in the draw has a legitimate chance of winning the tournament, and you try to make the most of it.""In Miami, Barty did. The former professional cricket player won her fourth tennis title and the biggest of her career to improve to 18-3 this year. At age 22, she'll rise next week to a career-high ranking of No. 9.Barty became the fifth different Miami Open women's champion in the past five years, and she's the 14th different WTA titlist in 2019.Roger Federer could become tennis' first repeat champion this year when he plays John Isner in the men's final Sunday. Federer won Dubai early this month.Barty's large repertoire of shots is both entertaining and effective, and she kept a weary Pliskova off balance while finding the open court for 41 winners.""I've always tried to bring as much variety to the court as possible,"" Barty said. ""It's about trying to neutralize what your opponent is doing. There was a phase in women's tennis of big power and first strikers, but physicality in tennis has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize the big first ball and work their way into the point.""Barty can strike quickly, too. Her surprising serve was superior in the final even though Pliskova is 8 inches taller at 6-foot-1.The Aussie won a 14-stroke rally with a nifty backhand drop shot to go up 2-1 in the tiebreaker, and she was ahead the rest of the way. She outlasted Pliskova in a 20-point game to break at the start of the second set, smacked three consecutive aces for a 3-1 lead, and won eight of the final nine points.Pliskova, seeded fifth, blamed her fade on fatigue. Because of rain delays, her semifinal win over No. 2-seeded Simona Halep lasted until early Friday morning, and she looked flat-footed in the final.""Run, run,"" Pliskova's coach, Conchita Martinez, implored during a changeover.""I was tired, super tired,"" Pliskova said. ""If I felt a little bit more fresh, it could maybe be different.""Barty made sure Pliskova never got her second wind, striking from all over the court. Among the Aussie's most acrobatic shots was a leaping overhead winner struck while backpedaling in pursuit of a lob. The crowd loved it, and so did she.""It's pretty cool to have played such a good match today in a big situation,"" she said.Barty won the Wimbledon girls' title in 2011 at age 15, but gave up tennis to play professional cricket in Brisbane before returning to the tour in 2016.This year she lost in the final at Sydney, a moment she listed as the most painful in her career. Less than three weeks later she reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the Australian Open.""That's why I love the sport,"" Barty said. ""You have these amazing moments, and you have these heartbreaking moments. But the journey in the middle is pretty bloody good.""______"
"Every month, Netflix Australia adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for March, broken down by release date.[Not the month you're looking for? Find the newest Netflix Australia guide here.]â€˜Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians' Starts streaming: March 1Following up on the success of the American football-themed â€œLast Chance U,â€ Netflix looks to India for its next multipart sports documentary. â€œCricket Feverâ€ follows a perennially successful cricket club, the Mumbai Indians, during a season when players struggled to measure up to their usual standards. Cricket fans ought to appreciate an intimate look behind the scenes, but even viewers who don't know the game well will have the chance to get caught up in the personal experiences of these athletes as they strive to remain excellent.—â€˜Losers'Starts streaming: March 1Sports' biggest failures are often held up as cautionary tales, or treated as minor characters in someone else's triumph. The docu-series â€œLosersâ€ looks back at moments when athletes flopped spectacularly, and asks how — or if — they've recovered. Some of these subjects are fairly well known, like the golfer Jean van de Velde's meltdown at the 1999 Open Championship in Scotland, or the figure skater Surya Bonaly defiantly finishing her Olympic career with an illegal move. But even the less familiar stories are fascinating, focusing not just on the worst moments of these people's lives, but on what happened next.—â€˜After Life'Starts streaming: March 8The â€œExtrasâ€ and â€œThe Officeâ€ comedian Ricky Gervais leans heavily on his offscreen reputation as a fearless and at times careless truth-teller in his new series, â€œAfter Life,â€ in which he stars as a man who reacts to his wife's death by becoming angry and unfiltered. Gervais wrote and directed the entire six-episode first season, which like his earlier TV work tries to balance brutal black comedy with earnest sentiment. But this particular show — even more than its predecessors — seems intended to deliver a heartfelt message, woven throughout its scenes of insults and profane outbursts.—â€˜Terrace House: Opening New Doors' Part 6Starts streaming: March 12The latest iteration of the Japanese reality series â€œTerrace Houseâ€ comes to an end with nine final episodes, all following a group of men and women who've agreed to live together, and to go on dates with each other, with cameras following their every move — and with a panel of commentators sharing jokes and best wishes. Unlike some reality concepts that push participants toward artificial conflict, or encourage them to lower their inhibitions, â€œTerrace Houseâ€ has won a faithful audience around the world for its refreshing mundanity. This show delivers what the reality genre has often promised: a chance to peek into ordinary people's lives and judge how they interact.—â€˜Love, Death & Robots'Starts streaming: March 15A different kind of anthology series, â€œLove, Death & Robotsâ€ compiles 18 animated short films, illustrated in wildly varying styles, but all aimed at mature audiences. The producers Tim Miller (best-known for directing â€œDeadpoolâ€) and David Fincher (the director of â€œFight Clubâ€) are shepherding a show that, like the groundbreaking â€œadult fantasyâ€ comics magazine â€œHeavy Metal,â€ will present tried-and-true horror and science-fiction concepts, with cranked-up violence, sex and surrealism.—[Want more Australia coverage? Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter here.]â€˜Queer Eye' Season 3Starts streaming: March 15The phenomenal popularity of Netflix's Marie Kondo series â€œTidying Upâ€ might be partly attributable to the earlier success of the service's â€œQueer Eye for the Straight Guyâ€ reboot, which has won audiences worldwide thanks to the cheery pleasures of an inside-and-out makeover show — where experts don't just clean out clients' closets, they also polish up their self-esteem. For the third season of â€œQueer Eye,â€ the â€œFab Fiveâ€ lifestyle experts leave the Atlanta, Georgia area behind and head into the heartland, setting up camp in Kansas City, Missouri. Their mission remains the same: to spread a little fabulousness across America, and to help people understand what really matters.—â€˜Turn Up Charlie'Starts streaming: March 15Idris Elba steps away from his usual action movie roles to take on the part of an aging DJ, who makes ends meet by providing child-care to one of his rich and famous friends. Elba (who's done quite a bit of disc-jockeying himself) also created â€œTurn Up Charlie.â€ Though he's alternated between the big and small screens throughout his career, this is the first time the star of â€œLutherâ€ and â€œThe Wireâ€ has been the lead in a half-hour, single-camera comedy series.—Also of Interestâ€œNorthern Rescueâ€ (March 1), â€œThe Orderâ€ (March 7), â€œFormula 1: Drive to Surviveâ€ (March 8), â€œImmortalsâ€ (March 8), â€œShadowâ€ (March 8), â€œIf I Hadn't Met Youâ€ (March 15), â€œGreen Doorâ€ (March 16), â€œPeaky Blindersâ€ Season 4 (March 21), â€œCarlo & Malikâ€ (March 22), â€œDelhi Crimeâ€ (March 22), â€œHistoria de un Crimen: Colosioâ€ (March 22), â€œMost Beautiful Thingâ€ (March 22), â€œSelling Sunsetâ€ (March 22), â€œOsmosisâ€ (March 29), â€œSanta Clarita Dietâ€ Season 3 (March 29), â€œTraitorsâ€ (March 29), â€œEl sabor de las margaritasâ€ (March 31) and â€œTrailer Park Boys: The Animated Seriesâ€ (March 31)—â€˜The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind'Starts streaming: March 1As a teenager, William Kamkwamba researched how to build a power-generating windmill, and used spare parts from around his family's rural Malawi home to construct a device strong enough to keep several small appliances running. These DIY turbines became an international news story, inspiring a memoir, â€œThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,â€ which has now been adapted into a movie by the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (who also plays Kamkwamba's initially skeptical father). This is Ejiofor's first feature film as a writer and director, and it's a heartwarming one, meant to inspire younger viewers, as well as to inform them about how a good education can help lift people out of poverty.—â€˜Hereditary'Starts streaming: March 5One of the more disturbing horror films of recent years, the writer-director Ari Aster's supernatural thriller â€œHereditaryâ€ stars Toni Collette as Annie Graham, a rich and successful sculptor whose combative family gradually deteriorates, going from deep dysfunction to open torment by demonic forces. A series of tragedies exposes the Graham family's dark legacy, as what starts out as a few freaky occurrences around their house blossoms into a full-on haunting. Collette gives an outstanding performance, as a woman who worries that she and her loved ones are inescapably cursed.—â€˜Juanita'Starts streaming: March 8The amazing Alfre Woodard stars in this adaptation of Sheila Williams's novel â€œDancing on the Edge of the Roof,â€ playing an exhausted working-class woman who gets tired of supporting her grown kids and decides she needs some adventure. She takes a bus to rural Montana, where she finds romance and becomes a more independent, confident version of herself. The veteran TV actor and director Clark Johnson directs â€œJuanita,â€ which plays like a combination of â€œAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymoreâ€ and â€œHow Stella Got Her Groove Back.â€—â€˜Triple Frontier'Starts streaming: March 13Although â€œTriple Frontierâ€ hasn't gotten as much advance hype as Netflix's â€œRomaâ€ or â€œThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,â€ on-the-ball film buffs have been eagerly awaiting the latest film from the â€œAll Is Lostâ€ and â€œA Most Violent Yearâ€ director J.C. Chandor. (Chandor also co-wrote the script with â€œThe Hurt Lockerâ€ screenwriter Mark Boal.) An A-list cast includes Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac and Charlie Hunnam, in a story about veterans who become soldiers of fortune, setting out to rob a drug kingpin. If it's anything like Chandor and Boal's previous work, â€œTriple Frontierâ€ should be a well-researched and finely detailed action-adventure, populated by complicated characters.—â€˜The Highwaymen'Starts streaming: March 29Flipping the script on the classic â€œBonnie and Clyde,â€ the police procedural â€œThe Highwaymanâ€ stars Kevin Costner as Frank Hamer, a real-life Texas Ranger who helped lead the hunt for the bank-robbing killers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in the 1930s. Woody Harrelson plays a former partner of Hamer who joins the crusade. The film was directed by John Lee Hancock, who previously made the crowd-pleasers â€œThe Rookieâ€ and â€œThe Blind Side.â€ He'll be blending true-crime grit with the entertainingly casual interplay of the two leads.—â€˜Jackie'Starts streaming: March 20Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar for playing the former American first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, in director Pablo Larrain and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim's impressionistic portrait of the events surrounding John F. Kennedy's funeral. â€œJackieâ€ emphasizes how the widow used her power to force President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration to respect and honor her husband's legacy.

"(Reuters) - Ashleigh Barty defeated Karolina Pliskova 7-6(1) 6-3 on Saturday to win her maiden Miami Open title and become the first Australian woman since 2013 to reach the top 10 in the world rankings. After dominating the first set tiebreak, Barty broke the big-serving Pliskova in a 12-minute game to open the second set. From there on the fatigued Czech, whose semi-final win over Simona Halep finished after 1 am local time earlier on Saturday due to rain delays, put up little resistance.Barty pumped her fists when Pliskova sent a forehand long on match point to hand the 22-year-old the biggest win of her career, which includes a $1.3 million pay check. Barty said the key to the match was extending rallies on the warm day in Southern Florida. ""It was important for me to try to make it physical,"" Barty, the first Australian to win the Miami Open singles title, said in an on-court interview. ""Kaja has the ability to really hit you off the court and take it away from you so I knew I had to have my running shoes on today to try and make as many balls as possible."" Barty fired 15 aces, with Pliskova barely making an effort to return some of them. ""I tried to make the most of it,"" she said of playing an exhausted opponent. ""You don't get these opportunities every single day and it was important for me to continue and try to do the right things and enjoy the moment as well.""Pliskova, who will rise to world number four on Monday, praised her conqueror. ""I'll make it quick because I'm very tired and it was a long two weeks,"" the 27-year-old said.""Congrats to Ashleigh. She played incredible all week, all the matches were close and especially today I thought she came up with some good tennis.""The win capped a memorable week for the 2011 junior Wimbledon champion, who took a break from tennis in 2014 to play professional cricket for the Brisbane Heat. Barty, the 2018 U.S. Open women's doubles champion, is the first Australian women since Samantha Stosur to crack the WTA's singles top 10.  (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"BANGALORE — West Indies finisher Andre Russell continued his destructive Indian Premier League form with an unbeaten 48 off 13 deliveries to lead the Kolkata Knight Riders to a five-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday. Twice a world champion in the Twenty20 format, Russell hit seven sixes from nine balls in one purple patch as he drove his side to the win with five balls to spare, keeping Virat Kohli's Challengers winless in five matches in the process. Kohli (84) and South African AB de Villiers (63) had combined for 108 of the home side's 205 for three but hopes of a first victory were dashed when their death bowlers were unable to contain Russell.The 30-year-old Jamaican all-rounder, who has now hit a remarkable 207 runs off 77 balls with 22 sixes in four matches, came out to bat with his side needing 68 runs from 26 balls and proceeded to flay the bowling around the Chinnaswamy. ""I was watching on the tellie upstairs so I kind of knew what the wicket was doing,"" said Man of the Match Russell.""Sixty off 20 odd balls is not going to happen every day so we had to make sure we put our bodies on the line and I didn't quit. I trust my strength and I trust my power and I have a good bat speed so I trust that as well."" The home side were not helped by pacemen Mohammed Siraj being suspended midway through the 18th over for bowling a second beamer and Kohli said they deserved their place at bottom of the IPL standings. ""If we bowl like that, (and) don't show composure in pressure moments, we deserve to be where we are in the table,"" the India captain said.""There's no rocket science behind it. We haven't played the kind of cricket we should be playing at the level of the IPL and if you bowl like that, with not enough bravery in the crunch moments, then it's always going to be difficult when you have power-hitters like Russell in the opposition.""Russell, who struggled with knee problems at the back end of last year, will be hoping his sensational Twenty20 form will carry over to the 50-overs World Cup in England and Wales, which starts at the end of next month.

"MELBOURNE — Australian Rules players will tear through a banner of hateful tweets before a top flight match on Friday as part of a campaign against online bullying.The indigenous game has been rocked by a string of social media controversies in recent weeks, with Aboriginal players suffering racist taunts and a prominent female footballer complaining of ""sexual abuse"" online.To raise awareness of the problem, the Melbourne Demons will hoist a banner emblazoned with negative tweets about players and teams at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before their Australian Football League match against Essendon Bombers.Players running through huge banners made by 'cheer squads' from crepe paper and sticky tape has been an Australian Rules tradition for over 70 years, although most showcase motivational messages or key milestones for players. The Demons players running through the banner on Friday would ""highlight how online harassment is a major issue not just for AFL players but for the one in five young Australians who are victims of cyber-bullying"", the team said.The Demons teamed up with ""Reach"", a youth-focused charity set up by the late former Melbourne player and president Jim Stynes, on the initiative.In a promotional video on the Demons' website (melbournefc.com.au), Melbourne's Aboriginal defender Neville Jetta holds up a placard with a tweet describing him as a ""scum bag"".Jetta said he had been deeply affected by racist online abuse, particularly early in his career.""In my early days I probably wasn't strong enough to call it out and they were the ones that I just deleted,"" the 29-year-old told an AFL chat show on local broadcaster Fox Sports.""It's not just racism, it's actually bullying, bullying people, and AFL players have that stance where we're able to speak out to the community and people actually listen to us.""Last week, Melbourne-based AFL club Richmond Tigers handed a two-year ban to a supporter who made racially abusive comments about West Coast Eagles forward Liam Ryan.Ryan, a 22-year-old Aboriginal, was called a ""monkey"" by multiple social media users on a local broadcaster's Instagram account.The sanction came days after AFL Women's player Tayla Harris complained of ""sexual abuse"" after a photograph of her kicking a goal triggered a raft of offensive comments on a broadcaster's social media account.

"Peggy Sue Gerron Rackham, who became part of Buddy Holly's circle of friends as a teenager and long reveled in having her name used as the title of one of his biggest hits, died on Monday in Lubbock, Tex. She was 78.Her son-in-law, Tom Stathos, confirmed the death but said he did not know the cause.As Ms. Rackham told the story, she was a sophomore at Lubbock High School in 1956 when she first encountered Mr. Holly, who had graduated a year earlier. She was walking to the school's band room — she played alto saxophone — and he was rushing to the auditorium to attend an assembly.He crashed into her, sending her to the floor, her books scattering and her poodle skirt rising over her knees.â€œI'm terribly sorry, but I don't have time to pick you up,â€ he said, as she recalled the moment in her autobiography, â€œWhatever Happened to Peggy Sue?â€ (2008). â€œBut you sure are pretty.â€He headed off. But she would get to know him better when she realized soon after that her boyfriend, Jerry Allison, was the drummer in Mr. Holly's band, which would become known as the Crickets.â€œAs a threesome, Jerry, Buddy and I spent most of our time together just hanging around at my house, listening to records or to Jerry arguing politics with my dad,â€ she wrote. She and Jerry went horseback riding, bowling and to the movies with Buddy and his girlfriend, Echo McGuire.Peggy Sue became â€œPeggy Sueâ€ a year later. The Crickets were in the producer Norman Petty's studio in Clovis, N.M., preparing to record â€œCindy Lou,â€ a song the group had been performing. (Its title was reportedly a combination of Mr. Holly's niece's first name and his sister's middle name.)But Mr. Allison was hoping to solidify his on-and-off relationship with Peggy Sue and asked Mr. Holly to change the song's name.â€œI think Buddy liked it because he knew me,â€ she told the website MusicDish e-Journal in 2004. And, she added, Mr. Allison â€œalways said, â€˜Peggy Sue rhymes with everything.' â€â€œPeggy Sueâ€ — â€œpretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sueâ€ — was released in 1957, shortly after Mr. Holly's â€œThat'll Be the Dayâ€ reached No. 1. And it was almost as successful, rising to No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Mr. Holly shared writing credit for â€œPeggy Sueâ€ with Mr. Allison and Mr. Petty (although the original label credited only Mr. Allison and Mr. Petty).Mr. Holly died in February 1959 in a plane crash in Iowa, along with his fellow singers Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper (J. P. Richardson). Ms. Rackham said she toured with the Crickets for a while after Mr. Holly's death, counting tickets at the gate among other jobs.She eloped with Mr. Allison in 1958; their marriage ended in the 1960s.Peggy Sue Gerron was born on June 15, 1940, in Olton, Tex. Her mother, Lillie (Rieger) Gerron, was a homemaker, and her father, John, was a civil engineer. Over time, she worked as a dental assistant and owned a plumbing business with her second husband, Lynn Rackham.Ms. Rackham's memoir, written with Glenda Cameron, was published shortly after â€œPeggy Sueâ€ turned 50. To recall her time around Mr. Holly and the Crickets, she said, she used about 150 contemporaneous diary entries.â€œI wanted to give him his voice,â€ she told The Guardian in 2008. â€œIt's my book, my memoirs. We were very, very good friends.â€Mr. Holly's widow, Maria Elena Holly, threatened to sue Ms. Rackham over what she said were false claims in the book.â€œHe never, never considered Peggy Sue a friend,â€ she told The Associated Press.Ultimately, Ms. Holly declined to sue because she thought the publicity would have helped Ms. Rackham sell books, her lawyer, Richard Wallace, said in an email.Ms. Rackham sustained her connection to â€œPeggy Sueâ€ in other ways over the years. She judged a Buddy Holly look-alike contest, helped promote the musical â€œBuddy: The Buddy Holly Storyâ€ in Australia and appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television program with the women behind other rock 'n' roll songs, like â€œAngie,â€ â€œBarbara Annâ€ and â€œDonna.â€She is survived by her daughter, Amanda Stathos; her son, Von Rackham; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her marriage to Mr. Rackham ended in divorce.A song as popular as â€œPeggy Sueâ€ ensured Ms. Rackham a dollop of everlasting fame.â€œIt's very hard to stand still,â€ she told the BBC in 2009, â€œwhen you're listening to â€˜Peggy Sue.' â€"
"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]As Petland Discounts opened stores across metropolitan New York, the pet store chain was propelled in no small part by a catchy commercial jingle that is now embedded in the region's collective consciousness.â€œPetland Discounts,â€ a nondescript chorus crooned over joyous synthesizer music. â€œFor the best care a pet can get.â€Later this year, that may no longer be the case.Last month, just days after the death of its longtime owner, Petland Discounts announced that it may have to close dozens of its stores and lay off workers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, according to notices filed with each state's Department of Labor.The company, which for decades has supplied pet owners with everything needed to keep their animal companions well fed, clean and happy, said in the documents that it would have to lay off more than 300 employees across more than 70 locations.Amy Eisenberg, Petland Discounts' director of public relations and special events, told The Brooklyn Daily Eagle that the company's closing was not certain. She said Petland Discounts filed the notices in case it needed to close amid the uncertainty caused by the death of its president and founder, Neil Padron.â€œNeil is the sole proprietor, and the family is still trying to figure everything out,â€ Ms. Eisenberg, who is Mr. Padron's daughter, said. Ms. Eisenberg declined to comment for this article.But Mayor Dwayne Warren of Orange, N.J., said in a statement on Wednesday that a national representative of Petland Discounts told him it would â€œpermanently close all company operations,â€ including the chain's outpost in his city, because of Mr. Padron's death.Staff and customers at Petland Discounts stores in Brooklyn on Friday acted as though the closings were all but certain. The fish tanks' bubbles were still roiling and the cockatiels kept chirping, but the people were glum.Tatiana Vazquez, the Park Slope store's manager, said she had known about her store's impending closure for about a week.She said Petland Discounts was struggling to compete with online retailers. Fish food priced $13 at her store, she said, could sell for $5 at the pet store site Chewy.com.Luis Garcia, 48, who has worked at the store in Sunset Park for the past three years, said that initially he was told that the chain could stay open if the owner's heirs found a buyer. He has since learned that the company will help him find another job, which he saw as a sign that the closure is final.Mr. Garcia added that he considers his workplace â€œa public zoo.â€Mr. Padron, who died Jan. 14 from bladder cancer, started his pet retail business in Queens in 1965. His first store was a tropical fish emporium that sold aquatic creatures, as well as the aquariums and supplies needed to maintain them.As Petland Discounts grew, it expanded its offerings. The chain stocked cat food and dog toys, but also hawked live birds and their cages, reptiles and terrariums, and small animals like hamsters and the wheels that kept them busy.Beyond supplying pets and pet products, Petland offered something for the animal-averse as well: its commercials. Punctuated by an innocuous yet mellifluous jingle, the advertisements left an indelible impression on countless New Yorkers who watched local television in the 1980s and 1990s.Adam Moss, 27, who grew up in Highland Park, N.J., remembered seeing the company's commercials â€œeverywhere and every day.â€ When he heard the company might close, he went back to listen to old commercials he had saved and others he found on YouTube.â€œI lived in the area so long they've become iconic to me,â€ Mr. Moss said. â€œIt was so disappointing. I cried for a while after relistening to some of them.â€Mr. Padron showed up often in the commercials. With his strong New York accent and bushy mustache, he stood out on local channels as he walked through the aisles of Petland Discounts stores, promising anything a pet lover could need at a reasonable cost.At the company's peak, Petland Discounts ran 118 locations across three states. As of this week, it operated 78, Ms. Eisenberg told Newsday.Petland Discounts said in the notices it filed that it would close all of its New Jersey and Connecticut stores by March 19 and its New York locations one month later.Steven Hernandez, 17, said the closure of the store in Sunset Park would complicate his procurement of live crickets for his two pet bearded dragons.If he shops online, he will be forced to buy in bulk, he said, and his apartment cannot accommodate so many crickets.â€œThis will make it a lot harder,â€ Mr. Hernandez said. â€œA lot.â€"

"LONDON — Reza Rashidian could give Dos Equis' famous and fictional â€œmost interesting man in the worldâ€ a run for his money.Mr. Rashidian has been a racecar driver, big game hunter, movie producer, real estate magnate, bon vivant, aspiring poet and artist, and noted collector — of cars, 19th-century animal sculptures, and watches.It took him more than 20 years of dedicated hunting to amass what he called â€œthe ultimateâ€ dive watch collection, featuring what several industry experts have called one of the rarest watches in existence: Rolex's Deepsea Special Number One. (The collection recently was detailed in the book â€œA Journey Into the Deepâ€ by John Goldberger and Daniel Bourn.)As Mr. Rashidian is considered a friend of Phillips auction house, and its London office on Berkeley Square was a convenient place to take a look at some of his scores of watches, we met on a recent springlike afternoon. And Mr. Rashidian explained why, after years of collecting all manner of watches, he decided to focus on Rolex stainless steel dive watches. â€œThese watches went to the greatest depths on earth,â€ he said, with divers risking their lives and equipment. The watches â€œare firmly a part of the human condition.â€The collector witnessed another side of the human condition firsthand as a young boy growing up in Tehran. In 1978 his father, who was in banking and real estate, sensed unrest and moved the family to a home they had in London, â€œjust for the summer,â€ Mr. Rashidian said. But the Shah of Iran was deposed in January 1979 and the family — its banks confiscated and some of its friends killed — never left England. Mr. Rashidian, now 52, lived in London most of his life before moving to Switzerland three years ago, trading the city for the mountains.Nature was an important part of the collector's early years, too. When he was 5 he started hunting with his uncle. â€œIt wasn't about killing,â€ he said, but being outdoors and â€œexperiencing nature in the rain, the snow, in all its guises.â€ His shoots might have taken him to Ethiopia or Tajikistan for weeks at a time, sleeping in tents or shacks. â€œYou have to love the outdoors,â€ he said.Hunting led him to create the cultishly popular Pro Hunter watch in 2006 after Rolex refused to customize one of its watches with a black case and glass (to eliminate reflection), fixed lugs and a NATO strap (to replace a bracelet that, Mr. Rashidian said, â€œyou can't crawl with, it digs in.â€) So he developed his own timepiece.Soon others wanted one, and owners now include President Bill Clinton; Antoine Arnault of LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton; FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault of Kering; Prince Pavlos of Greece; and Mr. Rashidian's friends Tim Jeffries, owner of Hamiltons gallery in London, and the actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers.Mr. Rashidian now is no longer involved in the business. And he no longer hunts. Not for big game, anyway, but he said he used some of the same strategies when collecting. A hunt starts with research, which â€œinterests me more than the ownership,â€ he said, a testament to his years studying history at London and Oxford universities. Another of the joys: â€œWhen you collect you find people with similar enthusiasm, and you share it,â€ at dinners and events where he meets other watch fans.His love of watches began early: His father, who died when Mr. Rashidian was 13, gave him his first watch. Mr. Rashidian opened a case and displayed a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust, with a strap now too small to circle his wrist. â€œThis put the thought in my head. This is where it started,â€ he said.Next, his mother gave him a gold Rolex Day-Date Oysterquartz for his 18th birthday, and soon after Mr. Rashidian made his own first purchase, a Rolex stainless steel GMT Master. (He raised the sleeve of his Hackett suit jacket to show that he still wears it.)In his 20s, when he started collecting watches, he bought some contemporary models like Patek Philippes, Audemars Piguets and Breguets. And Rolexes, which he said he preferred to wear because they stood up to constant use and were â€œmore approachable, and stainless steel is much more approachable.â€ He still has some of these early purchases in his collection.The more he learned about watches — especially about their histories, he said — the more he gravitated toward vintage ones. And few watches can rival the story of the Rolex Deep Sea Special Number One: In 1953, the watch, which has a signature bubble-shaped crystal, was strapped to the outside of the Trieste bathyscaph before the research vessel went two miles deep in the waters off Italy's Ponza Island, withstanding pressure of 8,820 pounds per square inch.The bathyscaph and the watch later went down even farther, to nearly 2.3 miles deep. As a result, Rolex marketing began making the brand's claim to dive watch supremacy and, by extension, sports watch dominance.Mr. Rashidian had brought the Deepsea Special Number One with him, and carefully removed the timepiece from its special case to display its unusual 35-millimeter thickness and distinctive domed crystal. He placed it on the table with the other watches he had brought. â€œThere,â€ he said in a â€œta-daâ€ moment, â€œis the most famous Rolex dive watch in the world sitting next to the dinky one I got as a boy.â€Mr. Rashidian recently sold two of his 36 dive watches featured in the book at a Phillips auction in Geneva: a Rolex Single Red Sea-Dweller, which once belonged to the celebrated diver Robert Palmer Bradley, and a Rolex Sea-Dweller made for the Sultan of Oman, with his name, Qaboos, in Arabic on the dial.He put those two up for sale because, after having amassed and documented what he considers the ultimate dive watch collection, he now is contemplating starting on something new and is deep into research.He won't say what his next focus will be, (â€œdon't reveal your handâ€ is one of his strategies) but it will be something special, as he said collectors should â€œbuy something unique or rare that has intrinsic or personal value.â€â€œI need to find new areas that excite me,â€ he said, and admitted that patience is not his strong suit, and apparently never has been.When he was a student at the British public school Haileybury, he was captain of the rugby team and looked down his nose at cricket. â€œI didn't have the patience to play that game. It seems like nothing happens for a very long time, and then suddenly people start to clap. It's not in my personality. I'm less cricket, more rugby.â€ And ready to score his next great collection."
"LOS ANGELES — â€œWe got a plane!â€Sitcom showrunners have no shortage of logistical worries, but air traffic isn't generally among them. That is, unless you happen to be shooting your sitcom in a backyard beside the Burbank airport.And so it was that Josh Malmuth, the creator of the new sitcom â€œAbby's,â€ stared at the sky one night last fall as his production ground to a halt, girding himself for another shoot to be interrupted every 15 minutes or so by an assistant producer with word of a plane, or a helicopter, or perhaps a drone.â€œAnd so it begins,â€ he muttered.Such are the wages of innovation. â€œAbby's,â€ which debuts March 28 on NBC, is a 10-episode multicamera sitcom that is shot almost entirely outside, a simple-sounding tweak that nevertheless turns one of the hoariest of television conventions into something that, as far as anyone can tell, has never really been done before.Natalie Morales (â€œParks and Recreation,â€ â€œWhite Collarâ€) stars as Abby, an ex-Marine who turns her backyard into a neighborhood watering hole, where an array of quirky regulars, including Neil Flynn (â€œThe Middleâ€), Nelson Franklin (â€œVeepâ€) and Jessica Chaffin (â€œSearch Partyâ€), pass their evenings and tee up one another's punch lines.It's the same basic setup that has undergirded any number of workplace shows and other comedies based on improvised families. This includes perhaps the greatest of all sitcoms, â€œCheers,â€ which also happens to be the series against which all other bar comedies will be measured.â€œThe â€˜Cheers' comparisons have been what everybody talks about, and listen, we'll take it,â€ Morales said. â€œThat being said, there have been a lot of medical shows, a lot of law shows, and people hang out in bars a lot. So we were like, â€˜I think it's fine to do another bar show.'â€The concept was inspired by Bacchanal, a New Orleans wine bar that consists largely of a graceful courtyard (and which figured in a rainy subplot in â€œTremeâ€). Malmuth, a San Diego native, moved the concept to his hometown and convinced Michael Schur, one of the most prolific sitcom makers in show business these days, to help him develop it.At first glance, Schur would seem to be an unlikely choice for a multicamera sitcom, the classic form — generally consisting of actors performing on a contained set before multiple cameras and a studio audience — that defined TV comedy for decades, from â€œI Love Lucyâ€ to â€œAll In the Familyâ€ to â€œThe Cosby Showâ€ to â€œSeinfeldâ€ and â€œFriends.â€Schur's tightly serialized, philosophically inquisitive â€œThe Good Placeâ€ is widely acclaimed for its narrative ambition, and the earlier filmic, single-camera shows he worked on, like â€œThe Officeâ€ and â€œParks and Recreation,â€ were instrumental in creating the perception that the multicamera format, with its stagy setups and broadly telegraphed jokes, was a relic of a simpler TV era. Even CBS's soon-to-depart â€œBig Bang Theory,â€ TV's top-rated show for much of the past decade and the longest-running multicamera sitcom in history, went single-cam for its spinoff, â€œYoung Sheldon.â€But Schur was intrigued by the idea, so he and Malmuth hopped in a golf cart and drove around the Universal lot in search of an ideal spot. They found it on the former Wisteria Lane, where the stars of â€œDesperate Housewivesâ€ once backstabbed (and front-stabbed, and actually stabbed) their way to ratings gold.After NBC gave the go-ahead, an outdoor studio was built behind the house that once belonged to Edie (the desperate housewife played by Nicollette Sheridan). The goal was to split the difference between a conventional set — with water- and windproof lighting rigs and a smooth, level concrete slab for easy camera movement — and a backyard, with strung lights, fire pits and largely unobstructed natural elements.â€œThere's an episode when you see Jessica's hair blowing a little more than it probably would, but that's part of being outside,â€ said Franco Bario, the co-executive producer who oversaw construction of the set. â€œThe more it looks like a stage, the less important it is that we're out here.â€The set includes bleachers for the just over 100 people who provide what amounts to an outdoor laugh track — each episode opens by noting, in a nod to sitcom intros of yore, that â€œâ€˜Abby's' was filmed before a live outdoor audience.â€ To reinforce the notion, the cameras will occasionally pull back before and after commercial breaks to show the crowd and set.â€œYou see the audience; you see that we're, like, literally on the side of a cliff in Universal Studios; you see the Los Angeles city lights; and then you see us on this weird little outdoor set, acting,â€ Morales said later. â€œIt's going to feel familiar, but it's also going to feel very novel.â€Schur said, â€œWe worried a little about breaking the fourth wall, but the very premise of a multicam is constantly breaking the fourth wall — you're hearing humans laughing.â€Though they have plenty of well-regarded sitcoms between them — Malmuth was a writer and producer for â€œNew Girlâ€ and â€œSuperstoreâ€ — the theatrical setting harkens back to earlier in their careers, when Malmuth wrote for the stage and Schur for â€œSaturday Night Live.â€But they weren't necessarily looking to reinvent an old format, they said in a joint interview shortly before the shoot, in another house up Wisteria Lane.â€œThe objective wasn't, let's set out to rejuvenate the medium,â€ Schur said. â€œThe objective was let's execute this idea as well as we can, and then this is how we're backing into that.â€â€œWe don't want to do it on a stage with AstroTurf, so what can we do?â€ Malmuth said.That said, there is a replica of the bar set on a nearby soundstage to use for rehearsals and as a weather contingency plan. (â€œAbby'sâ€ made it through its first season without a rainout.)But other things, like the menagerie of critters in the surrounding hills, you just have to deal with.The night I was there, a raccoon got into the craft services tent — â€œThat's a first,â€ Malmuth said when I told him — and skunks have been known to wander onto the set. Crickets are also an issue, though sound editors have to add them as often as subtract, for continuity's sake. During one break in the filming, a baby gopher scampered down the driveway and blindly caromed off several people's shoes before weaving its way back into the bushes.â€œOccasionally packs of wild coyotes come out of the hills and just maul an actor,â€ Schur said. (He was joking.)The odd mauling aside, a general feeling of festivity prevails on the set, with the crowd, crickets and flickering fires coalescing into something more akin to a summer-camp talent show than a network sitcom.During yet another chopper break, music thumped as a jovial M.C. whipped up the audience, who munched boxed dinners and huddled in blankets in the crisp (for Los Angeles) November night.â€œApparently these planes and helicopters don't care that we're trying to make a TV show!â€ the M.C. said, and then pointed out Schur, eating onion rings by one of the cameras, who waved at the crowd. Leonard Ouzts, who plays one of the regulars, mingled with extras as production assistants lugged an enormous tuna onto the set for a scene involving an elaborate fish tale.â€œThere are a bunch of jokes about how we're going to have to shoo cats away and it's going to start to stink, and those might just be prophetic,â€ Schur said. â€œIf coyotes are ever actually going to come out of the hills, it's going to happen tonight. So buckle up.â€"
"SYDNEY, Australia — India's president, Ram Nath Kovind, on Friday began wrapping up his visit to Australia after several days of meetings as the two countries move to tighten their economic and political bonds at a time of worsening tensions between China and the United States.The visit came four months after the quiet release of a 500-page report by Australia's former top diplomat, Peter Varghese, on the need to enhance the country's economic and security ties with India over the coming years.Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, endorsed that report on Thursday, calling it â€œa road map for our economic future with India.â€ He and other officials said the Australian government had agreed to work on strengthening ties between the two countries' education, resources, agribusiness and tourism sectors.â€œThe relationship is on an upward trajectory and this visit is likely to give it positive momentum,â€ said Ajay Gondane, India's high commissioner to Australia.Although the leaders' conversation focused on economic partnerships, their meeting and the Varghese report have pointed to growing concerns in both countries about China's aggressive rise, experts said, and the efforts needed to counter it.â€œThe report did not specifically say that India and Australia need to work together to balance China — it was much more sophisticated and nuanced,â€ said Amitabh Mattoo, a professor at the University of Melbourne and the founding director of the university's Australia India Institute. â€œBut anyone who reads between the lines would recognize that it's China, China and China.â€Mr. Morrison emphasized shared values between Australia and India, drawing an implicit contrast with China's authoritarian approach.â€œOur cultures might be different, but we believe in similar things — we believe in the supremacy of the ballot box in our national life; in the rule of law,â€ Mr. Morrison said at the India Business Summit in Sydney on Thursday. â€œAnd we believe in the rights of nations to live free and not under the controlling hand of others.â€President Kovind echoed that point, speaking of â€œthe peace and prosperity of a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific Region,â€ as well as â€œa shared passion for cricket.â€After unveiling a statue of Mohandas K. Gandhi and addressing members of the Indian diaspora in Sydney, Mr. Kovind spoke to students at the University of Melbourne before heading to a cricket game between India and Australia.The visit came as the two countries have become increasingly interwoven through trade and immigration.Two-way trade between Australia and India hit $27.5 billion last year; 700,000 people of Indian descent call Australia home, making it the fastest growing immigrant community in Australia; and more than 87,000 Indian students are enrolled at Australian educational institutions, Mr. Morrison said in his speech Thursday. He added that â€œwe welcome more skilled migrants from India than any other nation.â€India has also been a major investor in Australia's mining industry. Mr. Morrison said that coal was Australia's largest export to India, worth more than $9 billion in 2017.But one of those investments has drawn intense scrutiny: the effort by the Indian company Adani to open one of the world's largest coal mines, which opponents say would harm the Great Barrier Reef because of potential damage from coal shipments. The plan still awaits final approval.But this week, the focus has been on strengthening economic ties and broadening the two countries' strategic alignment.The talks came a year and a half after Malcolm Turnbull, Mr. Morrison's predecessor, met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on a visit to India. At the time, Mr. Turnbull put a proposed free-trade agreement between the countries on the back burner. Now there is a greater sense of urgency to build ties in order to counter China, Professor Mattoo said.â€œThe economic relationship will happen in any case,â€ he said. â€œIt is the strategic alignment that is important to ensure that the relationship really takes off.â€"
"The Canadian government said on Wednesday that it would withdraw up to half of its diplomatic staff in Havana, as it disclosed that another employee had fallen ill with the mysterious symptoms that have affected dozens of Americans and Canadians stationed in Cuba.Since early 2017, American and Canadian government employees in Cuba have suffered strange symptoms such as dizziness, insomnia, hearing loss and nausea when using a computer. Canada's government said that, in all, 14 Canadian employees, spouses and dependents have been affected.Global Affairs Canada, the nation's foreign ministry, said that after the last confirmed case of unusual symptoms, in November 2018, Canadian staff members in Havana undertook additional medical testing. Those tests confirmed â€œan additional employee has symptoms consistent with those of previously affected employees,â€ the ministry's statement said.Though the Canadian government had started â€œrevised security measures,â€ it said, â€œwe have decided to reduce by up to half the number of Canadian staff posted to Havana.â€The Canadian Embassy will continue to function with consular services and an ambassador, the ministry said, but some programs may be affected. It did not respond to questions about current or future staffing numbers.There was no evidence that Canadian travelers are at risk, the ministry said.So far, 26 Americans have been affected with similar maladies, according to the State Department, and doctors who examined some of the Americans said they had suffered inner-ear damage.But neither the United States nor Canada has determined a cause for the symptoms, leading to speculation that some kind of microwave weapon may have been deployed against the diplomats, who have described hearing a strange, high-pitched sound, often accompanied by a sensation of intense pressure.Two scientists have also suggested that a species of loud, droning cricket may have been responsible for the noise, although its sounds are rapid-fire pulses while the diplomats described an erratic sound.The United States has also withdrawn personnel from its embassy in Havana, reducing its operations to a bare-bones staff of about two dozen. And in October 2017 the Trump administration expelled over a dozen Cuban diplomats over the illnesses, after issuing a warning to Americans not to travel to the island.Cuba has denied any responsibility for the illnesses, and condemned the expulsions of diplomats as a â€œhasty, inappropriate and unthinkingâ€ decision that was motivated by politics.While the Trump administration said those expulsions did not signal a change in policy toward Cuba, it has taken a more hostile stance to Havana than the Obama administration, which began normalizing relations with the old Cold War foe."
"Adolescence is hard enough, but how are you supposed to handle trauma in the family when your parents are overwhelmed, absent, overbearing or just plain oblivious? Anger and grief have a way of hijacking your mind and heart, so when you can't get through to parents, you do what the tweens in these middle-grade novels do: Find a distinctive way of dealing with it, and learn that grown-up thing of putting on a good face even if you're crumbling inside.In Lindsey Stoddard's RIGHT AS RAIN (Harper, 304 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), the traumatic event is the sudden death of Rain's teenage brother, Guthrie. At their relentlessly optimistic mother's behest, they move from Vermont to New York City, while their father slips into depression. They arrive in Washington Heights dazed, a non-Spanish-speaking white family in a Latino neighborhood, and over the next two weeks — the time of the novel — a lot happens: Rain enrolls in a new middle school, joins the track team, qualifies for the city championship, enlists her stuporous father in building a community garden, and hopes that her parents will be the â€œone in fourâ€ couples that survives the death of a child.Stoddard has a knack for writing strong, feisty protagonists, like the heroine in her first book, â€œJust Like Jackie.â€ Although Rain is wounded by her brother's death and anxious about her parents' arguments, she is a self-assured problem solver. She has a thing for numbers: She counts — bricks, miles, minutes, anything — to â€œempty her brainâ€ and finds solace in running. Stoddard's exploration of grief's grip on a family rings true and tender; she does a remarkable job of conveying the emotional haze Rain's outward confidence hides. Lovely, dreamy chapters (each entitled â€œThat Nightâ€) flicker through the novel, chronicling Guthrie's final hours and revealing the guilt Rain feels over his death. There, we see Rain at her vulnerable best: saving herself, if not her parents' marriage.Carter Jones's parents' marriage will not survive the death of a child — that we know early on. In Gary D. Schmidt's PAY ATTENTION, CARTER JONES (Clarion, 224 pp., $16.99; ages 10 to 12), 12-year-old Carter's heartbroken family is propped up by an endearing visitor: an English butler who worked with their grandfather. The dapper, cultivated Mr. Bowles-Fitzpatrick attends to Carter, his three younger sisters and a vomiting dachshund, while their mother sorts out the death of 6-year-old Currier and the absence of her soldier husband.Carter is a good, compassionate kid, but he's torn up inside and steamed by his father's lack of communication. Schmidt seamlessly fuses humor and tragedy here, as he did in his Newbery Honor book â€œThe Wednesday Wars.â€ The butler can be a â€œpain in the gluteâ€ and a â€œblabber,â€ Carter tells us, while Mr. Bowles-Fitzpatrick gently chides that you should never â€œbegin your sentence with a subordinating conjunction,â€ like â€œbecause.â€ The repartee takes the edge off the loneliness Carter feels: â€œWhen you carry stuff like this around, you never know what kind of day it's going to be.â€It's striking that Schmidt chose cricket to put a spin on the boy-as-athlete motif. During a crucial match Carter's grief spills over. He has flashbacks of his most recent encounter with his father, on a camping trip after Currier died. The place had poisonous snakes, crocodiles and screeching birds, and Carter confronted his father for being absent when Currier was ill. Now, as the lengthy cricket match proceeds, he hears people in the crowd telling him to â€œpay attention,â€ which is precisely what his father was unable to do. One suspects that Carter, as he grows, will be more attentive to those emotions. He already is.There's no overt trauma in Aida Salazar's debut novel, THE MOON WITHIN (Scholastic, 240 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), but the circumstances leading up to a Mexican-Puerto Rican black girl's initiation into womanhood include anger and an overbearing mother. Celi is seething at her Mima for insisting on a â€œmoon ceremony,â€ an indigenous coming-of-age ritual to celebrate a first period. Lately, Celi's â€œflorâ€ (as her mother calls it) tingles when she's around IvÃ¡n, whom she knows from a cultural center in Oakland. So when Mima overshares by telling IvÃ¡n what a moon ceremony is, Celi stands by feeling â€œlike someone is stepping / on my chest / my breath stolen away.â€ Meanwhile, Celi's best friend, Magda, is entering puberty a different way, taking the name Marco and identifying as male. The gender transition seems smooth enough — until IvÃ¡n insults Marco and Celi laughs. Ashamed at putting her crush before her best friend, she stows it in her â€œheart locketâ€ — the imaginary place she puts her deepest feelings.Salazar tells the story in free verse, which works well to convey Celi's emotions, giving them a powerful, beautiful charge (â€œMima leaves me to cry / sitting in a soup / of hummingbird herbs and rageâ€), and less well for dialogue (â€œWhat you doing next week, Celi? / IvÃ¡n asks suddenly. / You wanna go to the skate park?â€). Although the novel has been compared to Judy Blume's â€œAre You There, God? It's Me, Margaret,â€ an instant classic in 1970 for its frank expression of how girls feel about their changing bodies, Salazar's book, half a century on, is less saucy: Where Blume's girls exuberantly chanted â€œWe must! We must! We must increase our bust!,â€ Celi wilts with embarrassment when Mima calls her father to celebrate that â€œour girl is growing breasts!â€Salazar's take on menstruation is contemporary and important, however: It presents families of mixed-race heritage embracing ancestral traditions (Celi eventually does), accepting gender fluidity and acting generally body-positive. Marco, raised Magdalena, has a ceremony as well: one to celebrate his â€œOmeteotl energy / a person who inhabits two beings / the female and the male at once.â€ For all that, Marco is still biologically female. Had he also gotten his first period, Salazar might have truly explored uncharted emotional terrain.Sam Abernathy first appeared as a high school freshman in â€œStand-Off,â€ the second novel in Andrew Smith's Y.A. series â€œWinger.â€ So THE SIZE OF THE TRUTH (Simon & Schuster, 272 pp., $17.99; ages 8 to 12) is a prequel of sorts. As a 4-year-old in Blue Creek, Tex., Sam spent three days trapped at the bottom of a well, and the murky memory now shows up in his claustrophobia and his fear of the â€œmurdererâ€ James Jenkins, an eighth-grade boy he thinks pushed him into the well all those years ago. Now 11, Sam skips from sixth to eighth grade, where he struggles with being smaller than his classmates. He harbors a secret desire to be a chef, while his father wants him to go to M.I.T. and become a scientist.Smith's narration alternates between sections called â€œEighth Gradeâ€ and hallucinatory sections rendering Sam's three days in the well, spent with a snarky armadillo (this is Texas) named Bartleby. Bartleby is a Yoda figure (â€œDon't go living your life only trying to avoid holesâ€), and there's a fantastical cantina-style scene, too: a choir of bats singing gospel music, a coyote waitress, Spanish-speaking otters and the coffin of a bank robber from 1888. The zany, philosophical conversation between Sam and Bartleby is sophisticated for a tween (yes, the armadillo utters his namesake's famous line), but it's thoroughly enjoyable: I happily would have read a book just about the two of them.Smith's delightful evocation of the weird and his ongoing exploration of masculinity show up in this novel, too. Sam's father, a kilt-wearing proprietor of a miniature golf course, takes him on survivalist camping trips. James Jenkins turns out to have a surprising passion other than football. He and Sam both have to face their fathers, and stand up for their less traditional choices.The truth, here as in all these engaging middle-grade novels, turns out to be large and complicated, made more so by growing up with loss and the heightened reality it brings. With ample reasons to succumb to grief or unhappiness, these undaunted tweens prefer not to."
"On Feb. 14, a 19-year-old drove a vehicle filled with explosives into a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces in Indian-administered Kashmir and killed 49 soldiers. Jaish-e-Muhammad, or the Army of Muhammad, a Pakistan-based terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.Over the past five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has governed India and been part of the local government in Kashmir as well, thus controlling India's policy approaches to the disputed, conflict-torn region. Mr. Modi embraced a militaristic approach and shunned a political process involving dialogue with the separatists in Kashmir. Consequently, the number of civilian and security personnel killed in the region have increased, and a growing number of young Kashmiris, like Adil Dar, the 19-year-old suicide bomber, joined militant groups.These are inconvenient facts for Mr. Modi, who has continually attacked India's opposition parties for being soft on terror and compromising national security. As the deaths of the soldiers come three months before a general election, an honest evaluation of Mr. Modi's failed policy should have led to him to being held accountable.Such questions, naturally, receded into the background in the immediate aftermath of the Kashmir bombing, in a national outpouring of grief. Before those pertinent questions would return to the national conversation, Mr. Modi spun the bad news to his advantage by turning the grief into an emotive and prolonged commemoration of the deaths of the soldiers.As Indian television networks followed the coffins of the slain troops draped in the Indian flag on their final journey home, Mr. Modi's party directed its senior leaders to attend the cremations, which were telecast live. The funerals became occasions for patriotic avowals, some genuine, some orchestrated, as politicians sought to ensure they were part of the frame.Mr. Modi ratcheted up the rhetoric against Pakistan and suggested that India would retaliate militarily. â€œSecurity forces have been given complete freedom, the blood of the people is boiling,â€ he said. On social media and television networks, retired military generals, such as G.D. Bakshi, echoed Mr. Modi's words and described the bombing in Kashmir as an act of war. â€œThey started it but we will finish it,â€ he said.The venerable Cricket Club of India, a colonial institution founded in 1933, decided to do its part by draping a portrait of Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan, which had been put up to honor his cricketing feats in the last century. The mourning took on a more sinister note as gangs of young men started parading the streets of many Indian cities, including New Delhi, shouting slogans directed at Pakistan and â€œanti-nationalsâ€ — the preferred term of the Hindu nationalists for perceived foes and undesirables ranging from liberals to Muslims.Several Hindu nationalist affiliates of Mr. Modi's party led a campaign that targeted students from Kashmir studying in educational institutions across India. They managed to extract promises from a few colleges that they would not admit Kashmiri students. The tone and tenor of the marches and the threats to Kashmiri students were not lost even on Mr. Modi's own allies. In an editorial in its party newspaper, Shiv Sena, the Mumbai-based Hindu nationalist party, cautioned the prime minister that â€œthere were political allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could wage a small-scale war to win elections â€¦. The rulers should not behave in a manner that these allegations gain credence.â€Mr. Modi's political use of the deaths of â€œmartyrsâ€ is not new to India, but we haven't seen it at such a scale since India and Pakistan fought a limited war over Kashmir in 1999. In the past two decades, Indian security forces have periodically been targets of violent insurgent attacks, some causing even larger numbers of casualties, but the grief has run its normal course.Mr. Modi and his party seem to be working on a template of exploiting calamitous deaths that they have used before. In February 2002, soon after he took over as chief minister of the western Indian state of Gujarat, a train carrying Hindu religious volunteers was allegedly set on fire in the town of Godhra by a group of Muslims. Fifty-nine people died. Mr. Modi ensured the bodies of the dead were taken to the Ahmedabad, the largest city in the state, and paraded through the city. Violence broke out soon after. Hindu mobs fueled by incendiary rhetoric from leaders of organizations affiliated with the Bharatiya Janata Party, targeted homes and businesses owned by Muslims. Over a thousand people were killed, over 700 of them Muslims.In his campaign for the state elections held a few months after the violence, Mr. Modi barely disguised his hatred and contempt for the Muslim minority, describing them as a demographic threat to India and seeking to connect them with Pakistan. The insurgency in Kashmir, which is the only Muslim majority state in the country, is often invoked in the same fashion by Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist party.Mr. Modi is at his political best with an electoral campaign run on sectarian and polarizing themes. Before the attack in Kashmir, he was facing an opposition campaign dominated by questions about unemployment being the highest in 45 years and distress in Indian villages. His party had already lost state elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, partly as a result of an acute farm crisis in India.This was the campaign that the Congress Party and other opposition parties were looking to fight; this is the campaign that Mr. Modi is seeking to avoid with the emotive call of martyrdom. Ironically, a vast majority of the soldiers who died were drawn from India's lower and middle castes with largely rural backgrounds, a far cry from the upper-caste, urban Hindu voters who are Mr. Modi's most ardent and hawkish supporters.What has largely gone unspoken in the aftermath of the Kashmir attack is that the C.R.P.F., the paramilitary force these young men joined, is heavily understaffed and underequipped, a stark contrast to Mr. Modi's bluster on national security.In 1999, I was working as a reporter in the northern state of Punjab. I covered the cremations of soldiers who had died in Kargil in the war between India and Pakistan. Each body draped in the Indian flag was accompanied by a soldier from the fallen man's unit. Those men were angry with the government and willing to speak on record with their names and ranks about being been sent to battle in the icy Himalayan mountains without proper equipment to shield them from the cold and the snow. When I wrote their stories, my editors refused to publish them and argued that it was not the time to report such things because they were damaging to the â€œnational interest.â€In the rhetoric of martyrdom that prevails in Mr. Modi's India, editors across the country are making similar calls and leaving out inconvenient facts and questions. It may or may not be in the national interest, but it certainly is in Mr. Modi's interest."
"LONDON — When Alfred Smith and Bob Weighton were born, Edward VII was king of Britain. They have lived through two world wars, more than 20 prime ministers and the entire rule of Britain's longest-reigning monarch. They also saw Britain join the predecessor of the European Union — a bloc it was supposed to leave on Friday, the day both men turned 111.As it became clear that the withdrawal known as Brexit wouldn't happen on his birthday after all, Mr. Weighton, who lives in southern England, echoed a growing frustration with the current political deadlock, calling it â€œa total mess.â€â€œMy own feeling is that if there were defects — and there were quite obviously defects — we can negotiate on the inside rather than walking off the field with the cricket ball and saying â€˜I'm not playing,'â€ Mr. Weighton told the BBC.But the most common question he has been asked does not concern politics. He said most people wanted to know the secret to his longevity — something to which he could not respond.â€œI have no answer, except to avoid dying,â€ he said.The oldest person on record living in Britain is a woman: Grace Jones turned 112 in September. But men are increasingly living past the age of 90, and more than 14,000 centenarians were living in Britain in 2017, the most recent year such statistics are available, according to the Office for National Statistics.Government population estimates see the number of centenarians passing 65,000 by 2031.Most British citizens receive a personal greeting from Queen Elizabeth II on their 100th and 105th birthdays, and one for each year past the age of 110. Mr. Weighton told the BBC that he would ask the monarch to stop sending him cards in order to save public funds.Mr. Weighton and Mr. Smith, who lives in Scotland, were both born on March 29, 1908. In recent years, their photographs have appeared in the news side by side, sitting in armchairs 500 miles apart. Though they have never met in person, the two men have exchanged birthday cards.â€œI feel he's a twin brother, although technically he's not,â€ Mr. Smith said of Mr. Weighton in an interview last year with the Scottish network STV.Both men have led an adventurous life spanning continents and different jobs. In the 1930s, Mr. Weighton taught at a missionary school in Taiwan, and moved to the United States by way of Canada.He and his wife, Agnes, were in the United States during the attack on Pearl Harbor that drew the country into World War II. He has a son who married a Swede and a daughter who married a German.â€œI flatly refuse to regard my grandchildren as foreigners,â€ he told The Guardian last year. â€œI'm an internationalist, but I've not lost my pride in being a Yorkshireman or British.â€Mr. Smith immigrated to Canada in 1927 and worked on a farm there. But he returned to Scotland after five years to drive trucks for his brother. He was a farmer until his retirement at the age of 70.â€œI like to think I've lived a decent life,â€ he told The Scotsman newspaper this past week. â€œI do ask myself — why me? Why have I lived so long when others haven't?â€ he asked. His wife died more than 15 years ago at 97, and one of his sons died in 2016.As to longevity, Mr. Smith had no definitive answer, either.â€œPorridge is helpful,â€ he said, â€œand having a job you enjoy.â€"
"Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for March, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.â€˜Eighth Grade'Starts streaming: March 1The ordeals of adolescent girlhood have been chronicled many times on screen, but not since Todd Solondz's â€œWelcome to the Dollhouseâ€ have they been as acutely registered as they are in Bo Burnham's directorial debut. â€œEighth Gradeâ€ doesn't share the sourness of Solondz's film, however, empathizing strongly with Kayla (Elsie Fisher) as she posts would-be viral videos, throws herself into awkward social situations and rolls her eyes at her overly attentive single father (Josh Hamilton), who doesn't know how to help her. Burnham is particularly smart about integrating social media and messaging into Kayla's story, and showing the ways they reinforce her isolation and desire to connect.â€˜La La Land'Starts streaming: March 1In the aftermath of its false Best Picture win against â€œMoonlight,â€ it's been easy to forget how much momentum and good will Damien Chazelle's throwback musical carried into Oscar night and how big a shock it was that it lost. But one of the benefits of â€œLa La Landâ€ not winning Best Picture is that it's no longer freighted by the â€œimportanceâ€ that goes along with the title. Chazelle's musical pastiche about the Hollywood romance between an actress (Emma Stone) and a jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) was always meant to be a light evocation of Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers vehicles, coupled with the bittersweet quality of â€œThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg,â€ and it's now free to be enjoyed on those terms.â€˜The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind'Starts streaming: March 1The superb character actor Chiwetel Ejiofor makes his directorial debut with this adaptation of the best-selling memoir about a Malawian teenager who takes it upon himself to save his impoverished village. Maxwell Simba stars as William Kamkwamba, a boy who loses his education when his family can no longer afford to send him to school, but who become an autodidact to bring electricity and water to his drought-ravaged area. Using scrap materials and science textbooks, he attempts to construct his own wind turbine. Ejiofor gives himself a key supporting role as Kamkwamba's father, who greets his son's initiative with a mix of pride and practical concern.â€˜Juanita'Starts streaming: March 8Alfre Woodard has been acting in movies and on television for 40 years, and she's as vibrant and appealing as ever in â€œJuanita,â€ a late-in-life road movie/romance that has been constructed around the title character's range and adventurousness. Adapted from Sheila Williams's novel â€œDancing on the Edge of the Roof,â€ the film stars Woodard as a middle-aged woman who follows a one-way Greyhound bus ticket from the Columbus, Ohio, projects to Montana, where she turns around a struggling diner and finds refuge (and love). But on a journey intended to liberate her, she worries about being tied down someplace else.â€˜Triple Frontier'Starts streaming: March 13Netflix's most prominent — and promising — film release in March brings together J.C. Chandor, the superb director of â€œAll Is Lostâ€ and â€œA Most Violent Year,â€ and Mark Boal, the screenwriter of â€œThe Hurt Lockerâ€ and â€œZero Dark Thirty,â€ for the story of an audacious heist that's somewhere between greed and justice. Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal and Garrett Hedlund star as former Special Forces operatives who attempt to steal millions in cash from a South American drug cartel. The good news for them? The authorities won't care about a cartel getting robbed. The bad news? The cartel definitely will.â€˜The Death of Stalin'Starts streaming: March 22With â€œThe Thick of It,â€ â€œIn the Loopâ€ and â€œVeep,â€ Armando Iannucci firmly established himself as the most scabrous political satirist of the 21st century, but he goes back to the middle of the 20th for â€œThe Death of Stalin,â€ which digs into the chaos and folly that follow the death of a tyrannical dictator. The operatives surrounding Joseph Stalin in 1953 turn out to be just the sort of inept, backbiting sycophants that populate Iannucci's other comedies. What's different about â€œThe Death of Stalin,â€ beyond its sumptuous period trappings, is how well it captures the fear and paranoia that seized the Soviet Union during Stalin's rule and threw the country into a period of uncertainty after his death.â€˜The Dirt'Starts streaming: March 22Even by the hard-partying, substance-abusing, hotel-trashing standards of '80s hair-metal outfits, the members of MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e were notoriously rambunctious, turning world tours into grotesque bacchanals that occasionally veered into the dangerous and self-destructive. Their collaborative autobiography, â€œThe Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,â€ is a bracing read that chases stories of shocking indulgence with sobering notes about addiction and a deadly car crash. The Netflix adaptation was directed by Jeff Tremaine, the man responsible for the â€œJackassâ€ movies, which seems like the perfect match for this material. â€œBohemian Rhapsodyâ€ this is not.â€˜Kubo and the Two Strings'Starts streaming: March 23The Portland-based production house Laika has produced some of the most distinctive and sophisticated animated features of the last decade, using a 3-D stop-motion process to add tactility to odd little films like â€œCoraline,â€ â€œParaNormanâ€ and â€œThe Boxtrolls.â€ Laika's â€œKubo and the Two Stringsâ€ enters the world of ancient Japan, where a boy wielding a lute-like instrument called a samisen tells stories out of dancing origami papers, but whose own life is destined to become the stuff of legend. His quest to stop the evil Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is notably abstract for a mainstream family film, but it's mitigated by kid-friendly team-ups like a talking monkey (Charlize Theron) and a human-insect hybrid (Matthew McConaughey).â€˜The Highwaymen'Starts streaming: March 29Over 30 years ago, Kevin Costner popped on a period fedora and tracked down the country's most infamous criminals in â€œThe Untouchables.â€ He's doing it again in â€œThe Highwaymen,â€ this time as a quick-triggered Texas Ranger who comes out of retirement to catch Bonnie and Clyde. He and an ex-partner, played by Woody Harrelson, are given maximum latitude as special investigators to end a robbery and killing spree that has left 13 cops dead, along with many others. Telling the Bonnie and Clyde story from a lawman's perspective sounds a little square, given the groundbreaking swagger of the 1967 classic starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, but there's something to be said for playing a good story straight.â€˜Snowpiercer'Starts streaming: March 31The brilliant Korean genre director Bong Joon Ho (â€œThe Host,â€ â€œMotherâ€) made his English-language debut with this futuristic â€œShip of Fools,â€ in which the planet has been rendered uninhabitable and what remains of humankind is packed onto a train to nowhere. But the rules of society still apply: The have-nots are relegated to the dingy back cars of the train while the wealthy elite occupy spaces near the front, triggering a class war that threatens to send them off the tracks. Bong's diverse cast of American, British and Korean actors gives â€œSnowpiercerâ€ the right international flavor, but it's Tilda Swinton who dominates as a Margaret Thatcher type who's a merciless enforcer of the status quo.[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox?

Now Netflix's latest sports-doc series, â€œCricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,â€ goes behind the scenes of a more successful franchise, the Mumbai Indians, as it tries to follow a championship year in the Indian Premier League. That's hardly the adversity faced by Sunderland, but in the cricket-crazed city of Mumbai, the pressure to repeat is enormous.â€˜Formula 1: Drive to Survive'Starts streaming: March 8The life and death of the Formula One racer Ayrton Senna was the subject of a uniquely compelling documentary, â€œSenna,â€ told entirely through archival footage of interviews, family videos and hair-raising moments from the racetrack. Now a producer from that film, James Gay-Rees, has returned to the same world with â€œFormula 1: Drive to Survive,â€ a 10-episode series about the athletes competing for the 2018 F.I.A. Formula One Championship, which starts in Melbourne, Australia, and ends in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Maneuvering lightweight vehicles at 200 m.p.h., the drivers risk their necks every time they turn the ignition, but they are able to check their daredevil impulses through intense focus, discipline and training.â€˜Arrested Development: Season 5B'Starts streaming: March 15Even before discussion of Jeffrey Tambor's alleged abusiveness on set derailed promotional efforts for the first half of its fifth season, â€œArrested Developmentâ€ has struggled to find the same absurdist groove of its original Fox run in its Netflix revival, despite enjoying fewer creative restrictions. Yet there's always the lingering hope that Mitchell Hurwitz's comic serial about the life and crimes of the Bluth family could turn things around. â€œSeason 5Bâ€ pivots around courtroom drama, as Buster (Tony Hale) stands trial for the murder of Lucille 2 (Liza Minnelli).â€˜Turn Up Charlie'Starts streaming: March 15Idris Elba isn't an actor known for his comic chops, but for a seven-episode run on the fifth season of â€œThe Office,â€ his seriousness and chiseled good looks were turned against him, exposing a well-disguised ineptitude. Created by Elba and Gary Reich, the British comedy series â€œTurn Up Charlieâ€ works a similar dynamic, casting Elba as a hapless DJ and bachelor whose weaknesses are further revealed when he has to play daddy to his famous friend's troublemaking daughter (Frankie Hervey). Elba does some DJ-ing on the side in real life, too, so at least that part of the show will stand to be authentic.â€˜Delhi Crime'Starts streaming: March 22In 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was gang raped and fatally beaten by six men on a private bus in South Delhi, a crime so horrific that thousands of protesters demanded (and received) legislative action to protect women against rape culture in India. The attack has been dramatized before, poorly, in Deepa Mehta's 2016 docudrama â€œAnatomy of Violence,â€ but the seven-part series â€œDelhi Crime,â€ by the Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta, was received more warmly out of Sundance. Mehta's series deals with the police effort to investigate the crime, focusing on a female officer (Shefali Shah) with a personal interest in bringing the perpetrators to justice.Also of interest: â€œA Monster Callsâ€ (March 1), â€œDog Daysâ€ (March 1), â€œSpace Jamâ€ (March 1), â€œThe Dark Knight Risesâ€ (March 1), â€œPatriot Act With Hasan Minhaj: Volume 2â€ (March 3), â€œChristopher Robinâ€ (March 5), â€œForgetting Sarah Marshallâ€ (March 6), â€œLucyâ€ (March 6), â€œAfter Lifeâ€ (March 8), â€œGirlâ€ (March 15), â€œLove, Death & Robotsâ€ (March 15), â€œSelling Sunsetâ€ (March 22), â€œThe Legend of Cocaine Islandâ€ (March 29)"
"Long before an ordinary chicken egg became an Instagram star, Jun Endo, a Ph.D. student at Kyoto University, sat gazing intently at another egg. This egg was much smaller, roughly the size of a sesame seed, and contained a stink bug.The mystery was this: When the egg finally hatched, it would do so virtually in unison with all the other stink bug eggs clumped around it. How? What signaled an egg on one side of the brood to hatch so soon after an egg on the other side?Synchronized hatching may be common in the animal world; scientist can't say for sure, as the phenomenon is not well studied. Sometimes bird eggs in the same clutch hatch individually, in a series that can unfold over more than a day. The broods of some stink bug species hatch over several hours. Mr. Endo's brood belonged to the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, which is known for wreaking havoc on farms and in suburban homes across the United States. Through a series of experiments, he attempted to identify the cue that got the eggs hatching. â€œAt first I had to consider every possibility — a sound, volatile chemical, vibration and pressure,â€ he said in an email. It was only when he played a vibration at a specific frequency, and the eggs promptly hatched, that he knew he was on the right track. Additional experiments confirmed that the vibration — brief, barely audible and recorded from a hatching stink-bug egg — signaled other eggs to follow suit. The discovery, described in a paper in Current Biology earlier this month, resonated not only with the stink-bug researchers of the world, but also with life-science researchers focused on biotremology, the science of vibrations.â€œNot many people know about it, but they should,â€ said Peggy Hill, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Tulsa, and author of a book called â€œVibrational Communication in Animals.â€ In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to the role that vibrations play in the lives of elephants, kangaroos, crickets and many other animals.â€œWhat makes it cool is that it's something we can't hear in the air,â€ Dr. Hill said. â€œBut it's an essential communication cue or signal.â€Hatching in unison is an advantage for the marmorated stink bug, said Hideharu Numata, a biologist at Kyoto University and an author of the new study. The hatched larvae won't eat other larvae, but they will eat the unhatched, so slowpokes risk being devoured by their new siblings. Last one out is an eaten egg.Dr. Numata has studied stink bugs for 30 years, and in that time has come to tolerate the stink. â€œI don't like this smell particularly, but I feel it's not so bad,â€ he said in an email. â€œStink bugs sometimes smell like some fruits.â€"
"HADDAM, Conn. — In row upon row, 436 tiny larvae are presumably fast asleep now, a few months after they were tucked inches deep into trenches dug along the sandy banks of the Connecticut River. The nestled larvae represent the last chance for one of New England's most endangered species, the Puritan tiger beetle — an insect tiny enough to fit on the pad of a thumb. The species only exists in small numbers in just two spots here, and another in the Chesapeake Bay area.  â€œThis is it for New England,â€ said Laura Saucier, a wildlife biologist for the state of Connecticut. â€œIf we lose our population in Connecticut, it's gone. The stakes are pretty high.â€Granted, the Puritan tiger beetle project — one of the largest insect reintroductions in the country — lacks the emotional appeal of protecting pandas or polar bears. â€œIt's not fuzzy and has a face only a mother could love, but they're just so interesting,â€ Dr. Saucier said. â€œThey're the top predators in this food web and the food web is down here,â€ she said, pointing to the sand, â€œso we don't know a lot about them.â€But for an ecosystem that runs from the Canadian border to the Long Island Sound, maintaining ecological balance is crucial, said Rodger Gwiazdowski, the entomologist who is leading the project and who has been dreaming for nearly two decades about restoring the Puritan tiger beetle.The beetles aren't an obvious missing link in an ecological chain; no other creature is known to have died or flourished as their numbers diminished, as far as Dr. Gwiazdowski knows. But â€œthey're part of a healthy river,â€ he said. â€œWhen we see a stretch of healthy river, we see beetles.â€ So, restoring them should help support the health of New England's longest river, whose watershed is home to more than 2 million people. â€œIt's powerfully naÃ¯ve to think it means nothingâ€ to allow the Puritan tiger beetles to disappear, he said.Which is why Dr. Gwiazdowski found himself motoring down the Connecticut River in October, remembering all he'd done to ensure that these immature beetles arrived safely at their destinations. If the boat should sink, he had a plan to float three tubs of beetle larvae to shore. Still, preparations and plans can go awry. One beach that he had staked out turned wetter than the week before, not ideal for larvae that can't swim. So rather than installing the larvae into several nearby plots, Dr. Gwiazdowski and crew were forced to release more than 200 of the larvae into one 12-meter stretch of relatively dry sand. There, the larvae created some sort of vertical bubble inside their burrows, protecting them from rising river levels.For the winter, the beetles are in a state of torpor — essentially hibernating — all season long. The more mature ones will emerge as adults some time early next summer, if all goes well. They can last the winter without food, but even the larvae are predators. They'll hide in their burrows, waiting for prey to walk by that they can pull down into their tunnel and consume. Their eyesight is among the most acute of any known insect and they display a very fast muscular response time, Dr. Gwiazdowski said. â€œComing and going, they're vicious predators.â€They look a lot like other tiger beetles, but have long strides, are slightly longer and sleeker, and their wing covers are a little shinier and more bronze. â€œEven in the sand, I can tell species apart by how they move,â€ he said. It's unclear when the Puritan tiger beetle began disappearing. It was first named in 1871, but wasn't nearly wiped out until the late 1980s, perhaps as the result of development along the river.Dr. Gwiazdowski doesn't want to pinpoint the locations where the beetles still live or where he's released the larvae. Insect collectors have been known to kill beetle populations, so he avoids specifics.For the release, he picked locations along the Connecticut that already had other species of tiger beetles — ones that are less selective and hardier than Puritans. He hopes their success means the Puritans will survive, too. But even if the Puritans all die, he said, from a scientific perspective the experiment will have been a success.â€œI can try and fail and that's O.K.,â€ Dr. Gwiazdowski said. â€œThe scientist in me doesn't care, as long as we know why.â€Last summer, Dr. Gwiazdowski and his team minded 30 or so pairs of adult Puritan tiger beetles they had caught in the spring, feeding them crickets and carefully harvesting their eggs every day, including weekends. Adults are easy to catch but hard to relocate, Dr. Gwiazdowski said. With previous releases of adults, the insects were never seen again, so scientists don't think the populations survived. The plan this time was to release larvae at different stages of development, hoping some would make it.Raised appropriately in captivity, each female can produce 100 or more offspring. But no one knew the optimal way to raise a Puritan tiger beetle — what kind of climate, prey or sand type.So the beetle team has been figuring it out by trial and error. Each breeding pair was kept in its own shoe-box sized plastic tub with a sand-filled Petri dish where researchers hoped the beetles would lay their eggs. Every weekday, a staff member sifted through the sandbox looking for eggs to remove, adding live crickets for food and replacing water in gel-form so the beetles could drink. The researchers couldn't put freshwater in the tubs, because the crickets — which apparently aren't very smart — would drown in it. Egg-laying provided another obstacle. Because beetles exist naturally on the flat surface of a beach, they weren't familiar with jumping or climbing into their makeshift sandboxes. Filling the tubs with too much sand would make the eggs difficult for researchers to find. Ramps of one type or another were too soft or too hard. Finally, the team obtained fresh clay from a quarry in Vermont. â€œThe day we put the clay ramps in, the fecundity exploded,â€ Dr. Gwiazdowski said.Restoring the Puritan tiger beetle's population had been a fantasy of his since he was an undergraduate student. But it wasn't until Dr. Gwiazdowski received a pilot grant in 2015 and another in 2017 from the Fish and Wildlife Service that he could start the reintroduction project. The challenge then became â€œhow to rear at scale,â€ he said. â€œNo one's done this before.â€He spent most of that money on salaries and on his Sunderland lab, housed in a former salmon hatchery, where multi-million-dollar, decades-long efforts to reintroduce East Coast salmon had failed. In giant tanks that once housed fish, he installed tubs of Puritan tiger beetles and enough insects to keep them well fed.All 463 larvae were raised in this room, whose climate was meant to constantly resemble a humid summer's day at the water's edge. A fan blew constantly across a humidifier, creating a fog-machine-like effect that kept the room at 60 to 80 percent humidity — enough to stop the sand from drying out, but not so much that the walls would mold.It takes two to three years for an egg to mature into an adult Puritan tiger beetle capable of reproduction. In the lab, scientists can speed up that process and keep adults alive longer.In nature, each female insect will reproduce herself — leaving on average one mature offspring behind, said Joe Elkinton, a professor of environmental conservation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who has collaborated with Dr. Gwiazdowski and helped with the release. But in captivity, insects can multiply themselves 100-fold in one generation, suggesting how many are lost to predators, starvation and other challenges. It also means that reared properly in a lab, it's feasible to mature enough larvae to make a difference at the population level, Dr. Elkinton said.Males are usually a little bit smaller than females. Researchers put a red dot on the males so they could be easily spotted and grabbed. From midsummer until the larvae collection was complete, the males were moved every day into a tub with a different female to promote breeding. Some females laid no eggs at all; one laid 126.â€œWhen you put life in a box, it gets very complicated very fast,â€ Dr. Gwiazdowski noted.Releasing the 463 larvae on the river banks was â€œlike kicking the kids out at 18,â€ Dr. Saucier joked. Dr. Gwiazdowski remained optimistic: â€œIt's easy to say goodbye. I'm really happy for them.â€[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]"
"The brain-eating monsters are real enough — they lurk in freshwater ponds in much of the United States. Now scientists may have discovered a new way to kill them. Minuscule silver particles coated with anti-seizure drugs one day may be adapted to halt Naegleria fowleri, an exceptionally lethal microbe that invades through the sinuses and feeds on human brain tissue.The research, published in the journal Chemical Neuroscience, showed that repurposing seizure medicines and binding them to silver might kill the amoebae while sparing human cells. Scientists hope the findings will lay an early foundation for a quick cure.â€œHere is a nasty, often devastating infection that we don't have great treatments for,â€ said Dr. Edward T. Ryan, the director of the global infectious diseases division of Massachusetts General Hospital, who was not involved in the research. â€œThis work is clearly in the early stages, but it's an interesting take.â€Infections with brain-eating amoebae are rare but almost always deadly. Since 1962, only four of 143 known victims in the United States have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half of all cases have occurred in Texas and Florida, where the microscopic organisms thrive in warm pond water.â€œThe classic case is a 10-year-old boy who goes swimming in the South in the summer and starts to get a headache a few days later,â€ Dr. Ryan said. The amoebae's feeding causes meningoencephalitis — or swelling of the brain and nearby tissues — and is often misdiagnosed.â€œWhen it comes to treatment, doctors often end up throwing in the kitchen sink,â€ he added.Patients typically are given antimicrobial drugs in extremely high doses in order to break through the body's protective blood-brain barrier. Many suffer severe side effects.â€œThe biggest challenge is finding a drug that can actually reach the right region of the brain,â€ said Dr. Ayaz Anwar, a researcher at Sunway University in Malaysia, who led the new study. â€œWe need a drug that can trick the body into letting it through — and we know that anti-seizure drugs can overcome that barrier.â€Dr. Anwar and his team first treated the microbes with diazepam, phenobarbitone and phenytoin, three anti-seizure drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The amoebae proved sensitive. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The investigators then bound the medications to microscopic carriers: silver particles only 50 to 100 nanometers in diameter, or less than one-thousandth the width of a strand of hair.In laboratory testing, each of the three drug-silver combinations decreased the number of amoebae cells over time. Diazepam in particular was at least twice as effective when combined with silver.â€œIt was an exciting realization, that's for sure,â€ he said.Dr. Anwar said he planned to test the approach in animal models using crickets, cockroaches and mice.â€œIt's an important first step in coming up with possible treatments for a very difficult-to-treat condition,â€ said Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. â€œBut this is still in a petri dish — it's a long way off from being implemented.â€"
"MUMBAI — For the uninitiated, kabaddi, the ancient Indian game that is taking the world's second-most populous country by storm, looks far too simple to be a professional sport.A hybrid of rugby, touch football and the playground game known in England as British Bulldog and in the United States as Red Rover (â€œRed rover, red rover, let Tommy come over...â€), kabaddi (pronounced kuh-bud-DEE) uses no balls, pucks, nets, goal posts, hoops, holes, rackets, clubs, sticks or bats. It is so unknown in the West that on August 8, 2017, ESPNU, the American digital cable and satellite sports television channel owned by ESPN Inc., showcased what it termed â€œthe finest in seldom seen sports,â€ including the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup Final. An exhibition match was played at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, but it did not catch on internationally.But those who take the time to examine India's rare homegrown game that is gaining appeal abroad begin to recognize a highly strategic endeavor that demands speed, strength, timing, an understanding of geometric angles and the kind of fancy footwork that would have impressed Muhammad Ali and Fred Astaire.Indians like that it's the only competition in the wide world of sports to require the player on offense to chant a word — â€œkabaddi,â€ derived from â€œkai-pidi,â€ meaning â€œto hold handsâ€ in the Tamil language — in one uninterrupted breath for the 30 seconds of his run at the defense. The sport takes its playbook from the Mahabharata, the 9th Century B.C.E. Hindu epic poem, where it's mentioned as a military formation called the Chakravyuha. It has been enjoyed for hundreds of years as a rural game played on India's dirt and mud fields.Now, with the establishment in 2014 of the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) and television coverage, as the league's sixth season is set to begin on Sunday, the sport has captured Indians' hearts, souls and TV remotes. Its popularity as a spectator sport is now second only to the British import cricket, which Indians still worship with near religious fervor. Last year some 313 million TV viewers watched league matches, according to Indian TV viewership surveys.Given kabaddi's recent gains, it should continue to penetrate the Indian market and may eventually even garner attention in the West.â€œKabaddi is a compelling gladiator-like sport — one man heroically pit against seven — with such old associations in India that I was immediately taken in,â€ said Ronnie Screwvala, the Indian multimedia entrepreneur who was the first person to acquire a team, U Mumba, when the league launched in 2014. â€œIndians have needed something they can claim as only theirs.â€The rules of the game and scoring are not intuitive to a Western sports fan watching it for the first several times.The basics are these: two teams of seven players each line up on either side of a 13-by-10 meter (42.6-by-32.8 feet) hard rubber mat, separated by a midline. There is something called a balk line behind that and a bonus line behind the balk line.To earn a point, one team sends out a solo â€œraider,â€ who must cross the centerline, tag an opposing player on the defense within 30 seconds, then cross back over the centerline to his side before being tackled. Players tackle each other with no holds barred, almost literally. Beyond that, scoring gets complicated for a kabaddi neophyte. Then the other team sends out a player, and on and on it goes for two fast-paced 20-minute halves.The game got a dressing up since its rural mud field days when Star TV India, an Asian television service owned by 21st Century Fox, teamed up with the league, which is owned by Mashal Sports, a Bangalore-based sports management company. Last year Star sold a 5-year sponsorship to Vivo, a Chinese technology company, for $47 million, that was the league's first corporate tie-in.The challenge for Star TV â€œwas unique in the history of televised sports,â€ said Uday Shankar, chief executive of the Indian channel. â€œFor a spectator sport in its embryonic stages, we've had to invent vocabulary for commentators, find directors who've had parallel experience, mostly from rugby, tweak some rules to make it TV-friendly, and even figure out what stats fans would want to track.â€Star also made the game more visually appealing for TV with flashing neon signage and smoke machines in arenas. Costumed crowd-rousing mascots bounce around before games and during breaks in the action. At least a dozen cameras catch it all.Mr. Screwvala gave his players a fashion makeover, â€œto make them look more appealing.â€ They got stylish haircuts and Oakley goggles to wear when not competing.Cumulative viewership for PKL matches rose from 217 million for Season 4 to 313 million for Season 5, according to Partho Dasgupta, chief executive of India's Broadcast Audience Research Council.PKL's Season 5 finale was the best rated non-cricket event on TV, with 26.2 million kabaddi viewers versus 55.6 million cricket fans, Mr. Dasgupta said.Mr. Shankar conceded it will take several more years before kabaddi begins to be profitable as a programming entity.In May, though, as owners bid on players for Season 6, Mr. Screwvala was ahead of the curve again, shelling out $138,690 for 26-year-old Fazel Atrachali, the Iranian defender who led the gold-winning Iranian team that beat India at the Asian Games in August. It's the highest amount ever paid for a non-Indian player. This may not seem like a lot compared to what cricketers and other major professional athletes earn in most countries, but it's a windfall considering the average annual per capita income in India is about $1,700.U Mumba also acquired Iran's Asian Games gold-winning coach, Amir Gholamreza Mazandarani, the first-ever foreign coach in the PKL.Of the 239 players selected to play for PKL's 12 teams, each team consisting of 18 to 24 players, 26 players come from some 14 Asian countries other than India, including South Korea, Iran, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Kenya, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Japan, Oman, Nepal, Thailand, Mauritius and Malaysia.â€œThis much foreign involvement in an India-born sport bodes very well for the sport here at home,â€ said Mr. Screwvala. â€œIn business, open competition always makes the good even better.â€An avid fan, he is often in the front row at U Mumba contests, with his wife Zarina and daughter Trishya Screwvala, all three jumping from their seats, cheering loudly at each score or tackle.Will the globalization of kabaddi catch on in the Americas and Europe?â€œWe can hope so, but it doesn't matter,â€ Mr. Screwvala said. â€œWe're just happy to see a homegrown product traveling to other shores, and spreading here.â€"
"NEVER HOME ALONE From Microbes to Millipedes, Camel Crickets, and Honeybees, the Natural History of Where We Live By Rob Dunn Illustrated. 323 pp. Basic Books. $30.A young man I know used to say that humans have no need to bathe, since our hair and bodies are designed to self-cleanse. I would fight him on it, being of the opinion that washing up occasionally was good for us — and for the people with whom we lived. But now, after reading the entomologist Rob Dunn's description of the myriad microbial life-forms that take up residence in a typical American showerhead, I'm starting to think maybe that young man was onto something.With an army of collaborators, Dunn, a professor of applied ecology at North Carolina State University, took samples of the gunk inside hundreds of showerheads, and found a profusion of microbial fauna. Tap water itself, he writes in the chatty, informative â€œNever Home Alone,â€ teems with amoebas, bacteria, nematodes and crustaceans. As the water passes through the showerhead, these microbes lay down a kind of scaffolding known as biofilm to protect themselves from getting washed away with every ablution. They make the biofilm â€œout of their own excretions,â€ Dunn writes bluntly. â€œIn essence, by working together, the bacteria poop a little indestructible condominium in your pipes.â€It gets worse. Filtered through that poop-biofilm, the water that washes over you, as you supposedly scrub yourself clean, might contain not only all those harmless amoebas and nematodes but a few bacteria that can be dangerous — in particular some species of Mycobacterium, cousins of the Mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis. And the pathogens are there because we provided the perfect breeding ground for them, when we tried to purify our tap water in the first place. Municipal water treatment plants use chlorine and other chemicals that kill off the bacterium's natural predators, allowing Mycobacterium to thrive. Tap water that comes from a well, in contrast, has never gone through a treatment plant and has a rich microbial life. It might look more dangerous, but it's actually safer, Dunn explains. All those organisms in well water are themselves harmless, and they tend to fight off the potentially dangerous ones like Mycobacterium — that's how biodiversity works.News from the showerhead biome is just one part of this fact-filled, occasionally disgusting, slightly alarming book. Dunn has been involved in an obsessive quest to document the tiny inhabitants of indoor environments, a project that involves teams of professional and amateur bug-watchers to take samples not only from showerheads but from door frames, refrigerators, hot water heaters, cellars, toilets, pillowcases, all sorts of surfaces from the places we call home. These workers swab and seal, swab and seal, and send their thousands of samples to Dunn's lab in Raleigh, or to his other lab at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, for an ongoing microbial census.â€œWe expected to find a few hundred species,â€ Dunn writes of his first foray into indoor microbe-hunting, which involved 1,000 homes from around the world. Instead, he and his colleagues found a â€œfloating, leaping, crawling circus of thousands of species,â€ perhaps as many as 200,000, many of them previously unknown to science.These denizens of interior spaces are our most frequent companions. In the industrialized world, we spend upward of 90 percent of our time indoors. Luckily, most of our co-habitators are either benign or actually beneficial in some way, like the house spiders that keep down indoor populations of flies or mosquitoes that can carry disease. But because we've become so hyper about making our surroundings as pristine as possible — sealing off our homes from the outdoors and using pesticides and antimicrobials with a vengeance — we've tipped the scales away from those harmless or helpful bugs, in favor of some of the bad guys.According to Dunn, indoor microbes are among the fastest-evolving species on the planet; they have an uncanny ability to live in ecological niches you could hardly imagine existing, like the dead skin cells we slough off every day (which is all that's needed to survive for a class of bacteria known as detritivores). They manage to evade our assaults, and evolve their way out of just about every biocide we throw at them. We're left to contend with the consequences of our own warfare, such as pesticide-resistant German cockroaches and bedbugs, and antibiotic-resistant MRSA bacteria. We have turned a relatively harmless indoor biome into something that can make us sick.That's the take-home message of â€œNever Home Alone,"" that the richer the biodiversity in our indoor environment, the better. â€œThe biodiversity of plants and soil can help our immune systems function properly,â€ Dunn writes. â€œThe biodiversity in our water systems can help keep pathogens in the water in check. â€¦ The biodiversity of spiders, parasitoid wasps and centipedes can help control pests. The biodiversity in our houses provides the opportunity, too, for the discovery of enzymes, genes and species useful to all of us, whether to make new kinds of beers or to transform waste into energy.â€I'm not quite as enamored of our microbial roommates as the author is. (I'm sorry, Professor Dunn, but I'm just being honest here: Those photos of the camel cricket and the American grass spider clinging to basement pipes and door thresholds — well, yuck.) It probably takes the soul of an entomologist, or maybe of a 9-year-old child, to love these bugs as much as Dunn does. Still, it's hard not to be occasionally charmed by his prose, as when he catalogs the arthropods with whom we share our homes: â€œbiting midges, mosquitoes, lesser house flies, phantom midges, freeloader flies and shore flies. This is not to mention fungus gnats, moth flies and flesh flies. Or crane flies, winter crane flies and minute black scavenger flies.â€ And it's hard not to share, at least a little, his awe at their diversity, even in a single household. â€œIf you see two flies in your home,â€ he writes, â€œthe odds are that they are two different species. Heck, if you see 10 flies in your house, they are likely to be five different species.â€And don't even get him started on the aphids. He's amazed by them, as he is by â€œthe wasps that lay their eggs in the bodies of aphids as well as the wasps that lay their eggs in the bodies of the wasps that lay their eggs in the bodies of aphids.â€There's a real sense of â€œgee-whizâ€ in this book, but it's mostly in service of Dunn's overarching goal: to preach the preservation of biodiversity, not only in the lush forests and streams that fit our traditional image of nature's abundance, but in the most humble places, too, where the vast majority of us will have most of our cross-species encounters — our basements, mattresses, refrigerator drawers and showerheads.About those showerheads: Dunn isn't suggesting that we give up showers. But he does say we might want to change the showerhead a little more often — and consider switching from metal to plastic, where biofilm is less likely to accumulate. Nonetheless, his bottom line for showerheads is like his bottom line for other aspects of the roiling microbial mix we live in: Don't be afraid of letting life inside. â€œThe water that is healthiest for bathing is that which comes from aquifers rich with underground biodiversity including crustaceans,â€ he writes. â€œThe crustaceans in these aquifers are an indication not of the dirtiness of the water but of its health.â€"
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan said on Tuesday that it would take new steps to seize and freeze the assets of people and militant groups who are on the United Nations' list of designated terrorists, after months of international criticism.The announcement came as India and Pakistan were still on edge after a suicide bombing in Kashmir last month led to a military clash between the two. And last month, a financial watchdog group, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, said Pakistan was still not taking enough concrete steps to curb financing and money laundering by terrorist groups.Pakistan risks being blacklisted by the task force, which would open the door to international sanctions that would be devastating to the country's already teetering economy.Pakistan's military has long been accused by its neighbors and Western countries of cultivating militant groups to use as proxies, including the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was widely accused of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed more than 160 people.The financial task force demanded more action in particular against Lashkar-e-Taiba and against Jaish-e-Muhammad, a militant group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers.â€œThere is a total consensus across all state institutions that these religious militias of all kinds represent a liability from the 1990s, a baggage of the past,â€ Moeed Pirzada, an analyst and television news host who has been briefed by civilian and military officials, said in an interview on Tuesday. â€œThey don't serve any purpose and need to be absorbed into mainstream society through alternate job creation.â€Mr. Pirzada said the main challenge was to make inroads against such groups by taking over the religious schools, hospitals and relief organizations that they operate as fronts. Prime Minister Imran Khan's government made some budgetary allowances for those actions in December, he said.[An American cricket club carries on despite India-Pakistan tensions.]On Tuesday, Pakistani officials promised to take stronger action in the coming weeks against militant groups that operate inside Pakistani territory.Pakistan has made those promises before, including when it was put on the financial task force's so-called gray list early last year, at the request of the Trump administration.But Pakistani officials say that there is greater urgency now, and that Mr. Khan's administration is worried about becoming an international pariah if it fails to act. On Monday evening, Mr. Khan gave a rare background briefing to news show hosts in which he reportedly emphasized that the time had come to do more to crack down on militant groups.Pakistani officials say they plan to freeze the assets of more groups, and to take control of religious seminaries that are affiliated with them. The officials said that more travel restrictions would also be imposed on militant leaders.In an initial sign of a crackdown, the Pakistani authorities have detained 44 people, including the brother and son of Masood Azhar, the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad. Shehryar Afridi, the state minister for interior, who announced the move during a news conference in Islamabad, did not specify any charges and said the detentions were meant for investigations.Mr. Afridi said the names of Mufti Abdur Raoof, the brother of Mr. Azhar, and Hammad Azhar, the son of Mr. Azhar, were included in a dossier that Indian authorities handed to Pakistan for investigations into the Feb. 14 Kashmir attack.Azam Suleman Khan, the interior secretary, said those detained would be freed if found innocent. â€œIn case we don't find any evidence against them, we will release them,â€ Mr. Khan said.As Pakistan continued to extend gestures that it wanted normalization of ties, its Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Sohail Mehmood, the country's ambassador to India, would return to New Delhi to resume his duties. The ambassador was recalled to Islamabad last month after tensions erupted over the Kashmir attack.Pakistan also said on Tuesday that a delegation would visit India on March 14 to discuss a draft agreement on a Sikh pilgrimage corridor between the estranged neighbors. The Pakistani visit will be followed by a reciprocal Indian visit, officials said."
"WELLINGTON — For 23 years the name Crusaders was a source of nothing but pride in Christchurch, the uncontroversial identity of a franchise that claims, with some justification, to be the most successful non-national professional rugby team in the world.The city was changed forever on March 15, however, when 50 people were killed and dozens more injured by a suspected white supremacist in shootings during Friday prayers at two Christchurch mosques.And after the wave of self-examination that swept across New Zealand in the wake of the attacks, it looks like there might now be nominative change afoot for the nine-times rugby champions of the southern hemisphere. The juxtaposition of a city embracing those impacted by the attacks with a nickname that recalls medieval wars between Christians and Muslims was quickly recognized on social media with some calling for the Crusaders to be renamed. The country's Sports Minister Grant Robertson said it was a ""responsible action"" to reconsider the name and the Crusaders, after initially saying it merely reflected ""the crusading spirit of this community"", agreed to at least discuss it.While the Crusaders told Reuters last week they were still considering a time frame and process, several fans at the team's match in Wellington last weekend were of the view that it was ""just a name"", albeit one they wanted to keep. ""I think that they have to have a chat to the Muslim community and ask 'are you okay with this?',"" Scott Wilson, a decorator from Christchurch, told Reuters. ""I don't think they should change (but) I think it might have been more prudent to think about the name before they adopted it.""While the name change has been debated widely in the rugby-mad country, Muslim groups have not engaged. The Federation of Islamic associations of New Zealand did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. SWORD-WIELDING KNIGHTThe Crusaders name was adopted by the Canterbury Rugby Union and five neighboring provinces when rugby went professional in 1996 and they were granted a franchise to compete in the competition that became Super Rugby.New Zealand Rugby made the final decision and chief executive Steve Tew -- who in 1996 held a similar post at the Crusaders -- said any changes would still need their approval. The team logo has always featured a sword-wielding knight, while pre-match entertainment at home games has traditionally involved horsemen dressed in chain mail riding around the pitch.This is not the first time the appropriateness of such imagery being used to promote sporting contests in increasingly multicultural western countries has been questioned.Several collegiate teams in the United States, including Alvernia University and Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania, have jettisoned Crusaders mascots and nicknames in recent years, as did England's Middlesex Cricket Club in 2008. Native Americans have also protested against team names and logos in professional American sport that appropriate, or worse mock, their culture.While baseball's Atlanta Braves and the National Football League's Washington Redskins have retained their names and imagery, there has been some change. Major League Baseball team the Cleveland Indians announced in January that the caricature of a Native American warrior known as ""Chief Wahoo"" would be removed from their uniforms from the 2019 season. ""OPEN-MINDED AND PROGRESSIVE"" Re-branding an organization as successful as the Crusaders should not be too challenging as long as it was recognized from the start that they could not please everyone, according to marketing academic and branding consultant Dr Michael Lee. ""If the team culture is healthy and they do a lot of good things for society and their community then you don't want to change that. All you do is change the name,"" Lee, an Associate Professor at the University of Auckland, told Reuters. ""You still have the same values -- you're a stand up citizen, do the right thing, help out when needed, all those sorts of values and the brand essence can stay the same, so in this situation it is really just changing the name.""The national conversation about underlying racism in New Zealand triggered by the mosque shootings could also help ease any name transition, he added. ""Within the current climate, I can see why this rebranding has a little bit more impetus to it than other brands,"" Lee said. ""There are going to be people who are really annoyed ... but New Zealand is very open minded and progressive. ""If a top team like the Crusaders did change their name then that would spark a discussion in the rest of the world as to whether they need to address other similar issues."" Michael Wagteveld, President of the Canterbury Rugby Supporters Club, told Reuters his body would support whatever decision the team made.There looks certain to be at least some change on Saturday when the Crusaders play their first home match since the shootings, with chief executive Colin Mansbridge suggesting the mounted knights would be given the evening off.""It's not unequivocal yet, but they're unlikely to be there and the game will reflect the occasion,"" he told local media last week.

"Seth MacFarlane's â€œStar Trekâ€ sendup returns to Fox. And an adaptation of an Aravind Adiga novel debuts on Netflix.THE ORVILLE 8 p.m. on Fox. When this series debuted last year, it marked a bit of a departure for Seth MacFarlane, the â€œFamily Guyâ€ funnyman. The high-energy, animated vulgarity of that show and MacFarlane's â€œAmerican Dadâ€ is dialed down here, replaced with drier humor and a heavy helping of â€œStar Trekâ€ — which is being parodied. MacFarlane plays the captain of a spaceship and crew in uniforms who shoot blasters that would blend right in at a Trekkie convention. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the show â€œemulates the original â€˜Trek' series to a degree somewhere between sincere homage and creepy necrophilia.â€ It returns for a second season after a yearlong hiatus.SPACE JAM (1996) 10 p.m. on VH1. This quintessential '90s kids movie places an animated Bugs Bunny alongside Michael Jordan. Danny DeVito voices the bad guy.SELECTION DAY on Netflix. In his 2016 novel, â€œSelection Day,â€ the writer Aravind Adiga (who won the Man Booker Prize in 2008 for â€œThe White Tigerâ€) explored the lives of a pair of brothers living in a Mumbai slum. They're raised under the domineering eye of their father, who is set on his sons becoming cricket stars; anything else is, to him, a distraction. Netflix has adapted the novel into an original series, which debuts Sunday.JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT: THE RADIANT CHILD (2010) on Amazon, iTunes and Mubi. A few years before his premature death of a heroin overdose in 1988, the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat was filmed by the director Tamra Davis in a rare interview, by Becky Johnson. That footage wasn't released at the time. Davis ended up using it as the centerpiece of this documentary profile of the artist, which also has interviews with some of Basquiat's peers, like the artist Julian Schnabel. In his review for The Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film â€œplaces Basquiat's art in a cultural context with an enthusiasm and zest that make the many pictures shown come blazingly alive.â€EATING ANIMALS (2018) on Hulu. Natalie Portman is now on movie theater screens in Brady Corbet's â€œVox Lux,â€ a film that addresses two complicated elements of modern American life: mass shootings and pop stars. In â€œEating Animals,â€ she takes on a third: factory farming. Following in the footsteps of â€œFood, Inc.â€ and Eric Schlosser's â€œFast Food Nation,â€ Christopher Dillon Quinn's documentary adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's 2009 book — with Portman as a narrator — forces audiences to think about where their food comes from. In his review for The Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film skewers factory farming â€œfrom philosophical, epidemiological and even economic perspectives.â€ He noted that â€œit seems impossible to come away from it without wanting to know more about where your meat comes from.â€ It hits Hulu right in time to inspire New Year's resolutions."
"(Reuters) - A brawl between World Wrestling Entertainment Inc's bears and bulls could reach a peak this year as the company renegotiates overseas contracts. While a large contingent of short sellers have been betting that the stock will fall, WWE's most ardent Wall Street fans say it will continue to rise even after outperforming the stock market last year and for much of 2019.Shares in WWE soared 144 percent in 2018 as U.S. TV license deals blew past analyst expectations with a 3.6-times hike in average annual value from its previous agreements. The stock has risen another 12.6 percent so far this year as investors are betting on license renewals being negotiated in countries including India and the United Kingdom, which WWE expects to announce by mid-year. Ten out of 13 analysts have buy ratings on the stock while three recommend holding the stock which last traded at $84.87. The mean share price target is $102.70 with the highest target at $157 and the lowest at $85, according to Refinitiv.While the stock has already risen a lot on expectations for new business, Gabelli Funds analyst Alexandra Cowie says it still has room to gain further. ""I wouldn't be selling before the contract news. Going in and coming out of announcements, it gets a double bump,"" said Cowie, whose firm owns more than 174,000 WWE shares. WWE is in an unusual entertainment category. Unlike traditional sports, its fights are scripted, but analysts measure its popularity against sports because it still involves athleticism and suspense.The creator of Smackdown and Raw TV shows boasted a U.S. cable television viewership second only to the National Football League in 2018, according to Nielsen data. And in India, WWE viewership was second only to cricket, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council.Guggenheim Securities analyst Curry Baker expects a UK renewal similar to WWE's current contract there. But he anticipates a fivefold boost to its average annual revenue in India to $124 million. ""The market is underappreciating the India opportunity,"" said Baker who has a $105 price target and a buy rating on WWE.MKM analyst Eric Handler, who raised his price target for the stock to $110 from $95 on Tuesday, says a possible U.S. deal for a third weekly hour of Smackdown could add $50 million to annual revenue. The company declined to comment on the prospect of an additional hour. WWE shares have fallen roughly 9 percent since last Thursday. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Vincent McMahon sold 3.2 million of his shares, or four percent of WWE's shares outstanding, to fund a separate entity. The stock last traded down 0.9 percent on Thursday in active trade though analysts said the news did not change their outlook It has also come under pressure as the broader market has been losing ground on worries about global economic growth. But analysts say WWE contracts - which are for around three to five years - provide some insulation against economic fluctuations. In the United States, live sports have been a key draw for cable TV subscribers, at a time when many consumers are cutting the chord to avoid high monthly fees. ""It feels like one of the lower-risk higher-return names in the media space,"" said Baker.Still, about 17 percent of WWE's float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners which estimates short seller mark-to-market losses of $359 million since the start of 2018. The bets against the stock can be partly attributed to hedging by investors in its convertible bonds due in 2023, according to BTIG analyst Brandon Ross. â€œThat's contributed to it,â€ he said.Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker is Wall Street's biggest fan, with a price target of $157. Wall Street expects 2020 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $460.59 million on $1.33 billion revenue, according to Refinitiv data. Ryvicker expects EBITDA of $510 million on revenue of $1.423 billion. With this in mind, Ryvicker says WWE looks cheap compared with other sports peers, including Knicks basketball team owner Madison Square Garden Co and a Liberty Media Corp subsidiary which owns Formula One rights and Liberty's subsidiary that owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team.WWE's enterprise value is roughly 14.8 times her 2020 EBITDA estimates compared with multiples of 32 for Madison Square Garden, 33.2 for Liberty's Atlanta Braves subsidiary and 12.6 for the Formula One subsidiary, the analyst wrote. WWE ""has no reason not to trade right in-line with its closest peers,"" Ryvicker said.

"(Reuters) - David Warner continued to blaze his way through the Indian Premier League with the bat but his misfield helped Kings XI Punjab to a dramatic victory over his Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday.The aggressive opener scored 70 not out from 62 balls for the Sunrisers, confirming his strong form ahead of his expected return to the Australia team for the 50-overs World Cup in England and Wales.It was his third half century in six matches and extended his hold at the top of the IPL run-scoring table with 349 runs at an average of 87.25.He has scored a century in addition to the three half centuries, indicating there is little rust in his game despite the one-year international ban for his part in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal.The suspension ended on March 29 and the 32-year-old is all but certain to be included in Australia's squad for the May 31-July 14 World Cup when it is announced this week.While Warner batted the entire 20 overs of Hyderabad's innings, tight bowling and muggy conditions in Mohali meant he was required to work hard as he guided his side 150 for four.India opener KL Rahul's 71 not out then led the Kings XI to a six-wicket victory with a ball to spare.Hyderabad did well to force the game into a final over by taking three quick wickets for eight runs in just 12 balls, leaving Punjab needing 11 runs from the last six.Rahul and England all-rounder Sam Curran scored nine from Mohammad Nabi's first four deliveries before Rahul hit the ball to Warner at long on.Warner fumbled it then slipped over on the dewy surface as he went to retrieve it, allowing Rahul and Curran to scamper through for the victory.Punjab are third in the IPL standings with four wins from six matches, trailing Kolkata and Chennai, who have both played only five games, on net run rate. Hyderabad are fourth with three wins and three losses. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Nick Mulvenney)"
"MUMBAI — The English weather will play a major role during the World Cup and teams from the Indian subcontinent stand to gain if hot and dry conditions prevail during the May 30-July 14 tournament, former captain Kevin Pietersen has said.England, which last hosted the quadrennial showpiece in 1999, has witnessed more batsmen-friendly conditions in recent past with scores of 300 regularly posted in one-day internationals held in the country.A hot English summer will translate into dry pitches on which the batsmen and spinners from the subcontinent teams are expected to thrive.""It is going to be weather dependent,"" Pietersen told reporters in Mumbai at a promotional event last week.""Last year was one of the most beautiful English summers since 1976. It was the hottest summer recorded in the UK with hardly any rain at all, conditions were extremely dry.""If the conditions are like they were last summer, then I think the subcontinent teams are going to have a massive role to play in the World Cup.""If they are not and it's horrible and green and seaming, then it's going to play in England's favour and the team that copes best in those circumstances.""While many see it as England's best chance to win their maiden 50-overs World Cup, India will also be among the favourites.Led by Virat Kohli, the two-time champions have more or less a settled batting line-up even though they continue to search for a reliable number four in the batting order.Opener Rohit Sharma agreed the English conditions could have a big say on their team selection.""I think we are pretty much settled. There are a few spots which everyone know about,"" Rohit, Kohli's deputy in limited-overs formats, said. ""It all depends on what the captain, coach and selectors think about the combination. Whether we need to go with the extra seamer, extra middle order batsman, extra opening batsman or an extra spinner. ""The conditions in England will matter the most. The last time when we were there the conditions were really dry. I don't know if it will be the same again. If it is like that then we need to get an extra spinner, as simple as that. If it's not then we should probably get an extra seamer.""All 10 participating teams will have to submit their 15-member squads by April 23, while injury replacements can be named until May 23.

"(Reuters) - Fast bowler Sam Curran picked up four wickets for 11 runs, including the season's first hat-trick, to propel Kings XI Punjab to a 14-run victory over Delhi Capitals on Monday.Chasing 167 for victory, the Capitals looked to be cruising at 144/3 in the 17th over with Rishabh Pant and Colin Ingram at the crease. But they lost seven wickets for eight runs as the Kings XI bowlers ripped through the batting line-up.Pant lost his wicket trying to smash the ball down the leg side when Mohamed Shami castled the 21-year-old for 39 before Ravichandran Ashwin sent Chris Morris back with a direct hit to run him out in the very next ball.Ingram did not last long either as he holed out to long off to give Curran his first wicket. The left-arm bowler then cleaned up the tail with a hat-trick spread across two overs.He first had Harshal Patel caught behind before getting Kagiso Rabada and Sandeep Lamichhane both bowled off the first two balls of the final over to send the Mohali crowd into raptures.Earlier, Kings XI were put into bat by the Capitals and scored 166/9 in their allotted 20 overs, with David Miller scoring 43 and Sarfaraz Khan chipping in with 39. Morris picked up three wickets while Rabada and Lamichhane got two each.Kings XI have moved up to second as a result with six points, behind leaders Chennai Super Kings on net run rate, while the Capitals remain in fifth place.

"(Reuters) - David Warner and Jonny Bairstow set a record for the highest opening stand in the Indian Premier League (IPL), with both players notching centuries for Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday.Warner and Bairstow put on 185 in just 16.2 overs in a 118-run victory over Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore, surpassing Gautam Gambhir and Chris Lynn's opening stand of 184 against Gujarat Lions in the 2017 season.Former Australia vice-captain Warner is fighting for a spot in their World Cup squad after completing a 12-month suspension for his involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town last year.The 32-year-old showed he has lost none of his power-hitting ability as he finished unbeaten on 100 from 55 balls, which included five fours and five sixes.Warner was playing the anchor role, while Bairstow stepped up the scoring rate to belt 114 from 56 deliveries, before falling to Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal.England opener Bairstow smashed 12 fours and seven sixes for his second-ever Twenty20 hundred, while Warner recorded his third consecutive 50-plus score to top the IPL scoring charts this season.""He's great fun, just going ahead with hitting the ball,"" Bairstow said of Warner after Hyderabad finished with 231-2.

"(Reuters) - Australia clinched a dramatic six-run victory over Pakistan on Friday, despite Pakistan debutant Abid Ali and in-form Mohammad Rizwan hitting centuries in the fourth one-day international in Dubai.Chasing 278 to win, Pakistan were in cruise control with Abid and Rizwan adding 144 runs to take the total to 218-3 before the middle order imploded in familiar fashion.Ali, whose 112 off 119 balls was Pakistan's record ODI score on debut at the age of 31, holed out to leg-spinner Adam Zampa.Umar Akmal and debutant Saad Ali fell for seven each to paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile, who finished with 3-53, while Marcus Stoinis removed Rizwan (104) and Usman Shinwari (six) in the final over to seal Australia's seventh consecutive ODI win.It was only the fourth time in history that a side has lost an ODI chase with two centurions. ""I thought our composure with the ball was really good,"" said Australia captain Aaron Finch. ""We knew how slow the wicket was, we knew if we could get some new batters in it would be tough. Credit to our boys, though Abid and Rizwan getting hundreds were great knocks."" Earlier, Glenn Maxwell fell short of a fighting hundred by two runs but guided Australia to a competitive 277-7 on a slow track, repairing the innings alongside wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey (55).The 30-year-old Maxwell was closing in on his first ODI century in four years but was run out while selflessly chasing a second run in the final over of the innings.Sent out to bat first, Australia began steadily as in-form openers Finch and Usman Khawaja stitched together a 56-run partnership in 12 overs.Finch was first to depart when he was trapped leg-before by fast bowler Mohammad Hasnain before Shaun Marsh and Peter Handscomb fell to Imad Wasim's left-arm spin.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah removed Stoinis and Khawaja, who finished with 62.That left Maxwell and Carey with a rebuilding job and they combined for a sixth-wicket stand of 134 runs, stepping up the scoring rate in the final 10 overs.Australia lead the five-match series 4-0 with the final match scheduled in Dubai on Sunday.

""Once I got through that, it got easier.""We've been really focussed about what we want to do here. We want to build on this momentum ... It's been a continual build for our team since last year, and we're starting to get it right."" Finch, whose role as a captain was questioned a month ago because of his form slump, has responded with 479 runs in his last six one-day innings.The 32-year-old was perfectly placed for a 14th hundred in the 50-overs format but holed out to leg-spinner Yasir Shah in the 42nd over.Maxwell and wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey (25 not out) added a quickfire 61 for the sixth wicket as Australia hit 90 in the last 10 overs.Chasing a target of 267, Pakistan were rattled by a testing new-ball spell from Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins, who removed opener Shan Masood, Haris Sohail and Mohammad Rizwan with just 16 runs on the board.Imam-ul-Haq and captain Shoaib Malik shared a 59-run partnership for the fourth wicket before the Australian spinners stepped up.Part-time off-spinner Maxwell trapped Imam lbw for 46 and Nathan Lyon removed Malik for 32, leaving Pakistan on the brink of a fourth straight defeat in the format.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa hurried through the tail with a career-best ODI spell of 4-43 to bowl out Pakistan for 186 in the 45th over.The win was Australia's sixth in a row after their 3-2 comeback victory in the series in India this month.

"MELBOURNE — Fitting the disgraced duo of Steve Smith and David Warner into Australia's World Cup squad will be ""bloody hard"" given the side's resurgence without them, according to captain Aaron Finch.Both Smith and Warner are eligible to return to the national side after their 12-month suspensions for ball-tampering ended on Thursday.Australia beat Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in their five-match ODI series, and have now won six matches in succession after coming back to defeat India 3-2 away.Finch said it would be tough for selectors to decide who to leave out of the 15-man squad for the May 30-July 14 World Cup in England.""It is bloody hard,"" he said.""Especially when the side is playing so well, it's going to be difficult. No matter who it is.""At the end of the day ... it's an incredibly tough decision. Whatever balance you go with in that 15-man squad, there's going to be some very unlucky blokes out there.""One could be Usman Khawaja, formerly a fringe member of the one-day side, who has flourished opening the batting with Finch since his recall in January, with 609 runs at an average of 55.36.The left-hander could make way for Warner, who has scored more than 4,300 one-day runs and 14 centuries, in an explosive opening combination with Finch.Smith, who has only just returned from elbow surgery, would complement a middle order of Shaun Marsh and Peter Handscomb, with all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell providing power-hitting through the lower-middle order.Having struggled for a period without Smith and Warner, Finch's side have shown the kind of form that propelled them to a fifth World Cup title four years ago on home soil.Finch said consistency of selection had aided their turnaround.""The fact that guys are getting more of an opportunity to keep developing their role, and developing the role they've been asked to play or the game demands, is gold,"" he said.""That probably goes under the radar a little bit when you're looking at teams that have been successful in the past.""I think leading up to the 2015 World Cup, we'd had the same 15 players for a good 18 months or so.

"LONDON — Theresa May is set to join the ranks of Conservative prime ministers whose time in office has been overwhelmed — and cut short — by the issue of Europe.Ever since Edward Heath took the U.K. into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the Conservative Party has been anguished by how close the country's ties should be with the continent.All of Heath's Conservative successors in 10 Downing Street — Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron — have been swamped by Europe. On Wednesday, May told lawmakers from her own party that she will step down once she has secured Britain's departure from the European Union. Though the actual Brexit date remains clouded in mystery, few expect May to last more than a few more months.""Throughout my adult lifetime, every Conservative prime minister has been brought down by Europe,"" Damian Green, a long-time close associate of May and a former member of her Cabinet, told BBC radio Thursday.""For a successful political party that represents a very significant part of this country .... that is extraordinary.""___EDWARD HEATH, Prime Minister 1970-1974On taking office, Heath made membership of the EEC a key objective. He was fortunate to have in Georges Pompidou a French president more amenable to the prospect of Britain joining the bloc than his predecessor Charles de Gaulle, who twice in the 1960s vetoed British membership.In October 1971, the House of Commons voted by a margin of 356 votes to 244 to join the EEC in 1973, with a sizeable chunk of Heath's own party voting against. Though Heath and the Conservatives were voted out of office a year later after an economic crisis, his passionate pro-European stance weighed against him when Thatcher challenged him for the party's leadership in 1975.___MARGARET THATCHER, Prime Minister 1979-1990Thatcher was a keen backer of the EEC at first — she even wore a sweater with the flags of the member countries during Britain's first referendum on membership of the bloc in 1975. But her 11 years in Downing Street were marked by growing opposition to Europe.Though her government backed the creation of the single European market in the mid-1980s, she became increasingly hostile to the move to further integrate European countries.The appointment of French socialist Jacques Delors to head the executive European Commission added fuel to her fire. Thatcher and a growing part of the Conservative Party were aghast at Delors' ambition for a single currency.In a 1988 speech, Thatcher rejected the prospect of a ""European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" Not everyone in her party was that hostile, and Thatcher's growing antipathy to Europe prompted the 1990 resignation of her deputy.In a cricket reference, Geoffrey Howe savaged Thatcher, arguing that she was sabotaging discussions with Europe: ""It's rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find the moment the first balls are bowled, their bats have been broken by the team captain.""Thatcher's time was up.___JOHN MAJOR, Prime Minister 1990-1997Her successor, John Major, sought to mend fences with Europe, even while keeping Britain out of the single currency. His government would soon after descend into civil war over the Maastricht Treaty, which bolstered integration on an array of issues, including foreign policy, and led to the creation of what is now known as the European Union.Many of the hard-line euroskeptic lawmakers who have bedeviled May's leadership came to the fore during Major's premiership. John Redwood, one of the more passionate Brexit-backers in Parliament, challenged Major for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1995. Though he lost overwhelmingly, it was clear that the party was riven by the issue of Europe, both in parliament and beyond.Hugely divided, the Conservatives, after 18 years in office, suffered one of their worst defeats in history in 1997 in an election that saw Tony Blair lead a decidedly pro-European Labour Party into power. His ambition was to put Britain at the ""heart of Europe"" and he even indicated a willingness for the country to join the euro, which launched in 1999.___DAVID CAMERON, Prime Minister 2010-2016During the Blair years, the Conservatives became more and more hostile to the EU. But Cameron promised that his party would no longer carry on ""banging on about Europe.""Despite his intention, Cameron couldn't avoid the issue of Europe when becoming prime minister in 2010, leading a coalition with the far-more pro-European Liberal Democrats. With the U.K. Independence Party making headway with its demand for a fresh vote on Britain's membership, and its assertion that Britain had ceded too much sovereignty to Brussels, Cameron felt compelled to promise a referendum to bind his party together.That referendum took place on June 23, 2016 and the British people voted by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the EU. Cameron resigned the day after and May won the ensuing succession battle on a promise to deliver Brexit.Nearly three years on, that's proven more difficult than she could possibly have imagined. And in perhaps her final roll of the dice, she has promised to step down if Parliament backs her twice-rejected Brexit deal.Whenever she leaves, her successor, whoever he or she is, will likely face the same problems.""Prediction: the same fate awaits her successor, whoever it is,"" Nick Boles, a Conservative lawmaker, tweeted soon after May's announcement.___Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit"
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan has introduced an ambitious poverty alleviation plan that he says would help the country's poorest gain better access to health care, education, and employment.Mr. Khan said his government would allocate 80 billion rupees — more than half a billion dollars — for an anti-poverty plan known as â€œEhsas,â€ or Empathy, and raise it to 120 billion rupees by 2021.â€œNo Pakistani government has spent so much money on alleviating poverty in the past,â€ Mr. Khan said Wednesday during a ceremony in Islamabad, the capital. â€œThe government has launched a war against poverty.â€Pakistan has an estimated population of 207.2 million people, almost a quarter of whom live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.Fighting poverty was a central issue of his campaign when he won the general elections in July. But implementing that promise — and particularly the Ehsas plan, which is at its heart the establishment of a welfare state — will be exceptionally difficult, given the country's economic crisis.Pakistan is facing a worsening balance-of-payments crisis and is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout package. Pakistan has also looked for financial support from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.The I.M.F. has said that Pakistan has low international reserves and a high fiscal and current account deficit. Talks between Pakistan and the I.M.F. have continued for months and are now at the final stages, officials said.Despite the challenges, Mr. Khan insisted that the welfare program should proceed. â€œI know the economic conditions are difficult,â€ Mr. Khan said.The program would include extensive aid so that the poor could afford health care, and would include easier loan terms for families seeking to build or buy homes. The plan also includes several economic empowerment measures for women, including savings accounts and mobile phones for an estimated 5.7 million poor women.Mr. Khan has proposed a constitutional amendment that would make basic necessities such as food, housing, education and health care a fundamental right. The amendment would require the approval of Parliament.Analysts were skeptical that much of the program could be enacted. But many praised Mr. Khan for at least focusing national attention on the country's poverty.â€œIn his first address to the nation, Mr. Khan surprised many critics when he spoke at length about nutrition, child protection, education and maternal and neonatal health,â€ said Mosharraf Zaidi, a public policy analyst. â€œIn launching the Ehsas anti-poverty plan, he has given concrete shape to his longstanding human development ambitions.â€â€œWith an unprecedented shortfall in tax collection and a major new incoming I.M.F. program, the freedom to spend public funds on the poor will likely be even more curtailed,â€ Mr. Zaidi added. â€œHow P.M. Khan manages to balance between his pro-poor instincts and the shrinking wallet available to him will be crucial to the initial success of Ehsas.â€Decades before entering to office, Mr. Khan, a former cricket star who made philanthropy a central part of his public appeal, led an effort to finance and build the country's first dedicated cancer hospital, which treats poor patients for free. In his speech on Wednesday, he pointed out that at the time of its inception, no one thought the hospital campaign could work.â€œIf I had gone by logic, I would never have been able to complete this project,â€ he said, referring to the cancer hospital.â€œWhen a nation decides to help its poor, God finds ways for it to succeed. The real thing is to have honest intentions,â€ Mr. Khan said. â€œIt is my belief that, God willing, one day you will see that we would be successful in eradicating poverty.â€â€œI also want to give a modern day example of China,â€ Mr. Khan added. â€œWho would have thought 30 years ago that a country could pull 700 million people out of poverty? It has never happened in the world's history.â€During a visit to China last year, Mr. Khan had said that he was keen to emulate the Chinese example of development and was learning from its experiences.In announcing his anti-poverty plan, Mr. Khan said that by December the government would complete a new nationwide poverty survey that would help identify the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. He has announced the formation of a new ministry that would bring different social welfare programs under one umbrella.For women, who face extensive religious, social and economic barriers to advancement in Pakistan, Mr. Khan also envisioned a campaign to provide goats and hens to rural women to help with both food security and personal income sources. The plan also provides financial support to those widows who have no sources of income.Mr. Khan also said 50 percent of women would receive scholarships and education vouchers.The government, he said, â€œwill ensure that the invisible but hard work of rural women is recognized, that they have equal wages, and that domestic work is covered under legislation.â€The plan also includes a partnership with aid groups to support street children, transgender people and daily-wage workers. And it would feature new availability for cash grants and pensions, and higher government spending on education and health care.â€œThere isn't a single formula to eradicate poverty,â€ Mr. Khan said. â€œMany steps have to be taken.â€"
"Like tick-tack-toe, five-day cricket matches and Italian soccer in the 1980s, chess has a lot of draws. But the two grandmasters currently battling for the world title in London, Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, may be taking it a little too far.Eight of the 12 games in their world championship match are over. And every one of them, including Monday's Game 8, has ended in a draw.For the past week and a half, Carlsen and Caruana, the two best players in the world, have matched wits, and moves, across a table in an auditorium in hourslong games. It can all feel a bit sterile at times, with the players separated from those watching by one-way glass, and the tension broken only by the occasional scheduled rest day.From that detached vantage point, and even more distance online, the chess news media and fans have watched and analyzed the movement of each piece with excitement. And still, no one wins.Occasionally it has seemed as if someone might. In Game 1 last week there was excitement as the champion Carlsen pushed for victory, causing some to speculate that he was on his way to making quick work of Caruana, his American challenger.But after a seven-hour marathon, Caruana, who at one point had been desperately short on time, fought back and earned a draw. That result seemed to set the tone that has continued.In Game 6 on Friday, it was Caruana's turn to reach the brink of victory. He came desperately close to closing out Carlsen, only to be stymied in the last moves.After Game 7, Carlsen declared, â€œWhat I did was just way too soft.â€â€œI'm not loving it, but I'm not in any sort of panic mode either,â€ he added. â€œIt could have been worse.â€He would know: He has been here before. The 2013 championship, when Carlsen won his title, began with four draws. His first defense, in 2014, started with only one.In 2016, the last time Carlsen defended his title, the match began with seven consecutive draws. Then the challenger, Sergey Karjakin of Russia, won a game, but Carlsen came back to win one of his own before retaining his crown in a tiebreaker.Ah, yes, the tiebreaker. Monday's draw leaves four games to go in this year's match. If no one wins any of them, the players will begin an arduous run of tiebreakers on Nov. 28 in the hopes that someone will actually win a game.First, the players will face off in four games with a rapid time limit of only 25 minutes per player.Four more draws? They will next play up to 10 more games at the blinding pace of only five minutes per player — so-called blitz games.Still drawing? It's time for an Armageddon game. In it, Carlsen and Caruana would play a single game: Whoever draws white — and goes first — will get five minutes, while black will get four.If this game, too, is a draw, then the organizers will simply throw up their hands and declare black the winner of the match.Really."
"So which is it? How do you pronounce Gemini?In â€œFirst Man,â€ the new film about the Neil Armstrong and the moon landing, astronauts and NASA officials say â€œGEM-uh-knee.â€ But the first pronunciation in the Webster's New World College Dictionary Fifth Edition, the standard work used by The New York Times to settle such matters, the first pronunciation is GEM-uh-neye,â€ which is the way many of us say it. Or, to use the precise dictionary typography, jemâ€²É™ nÄ«Î„ versus jemâ€²É™nÄ“Î„.Really, though, which is right?The 10 crewed missions of the Gemini program, with capsules that carried two people into space in 1965 and 1966, never got the attention that the programs before and after it received. Mercury and the seven original astronauts had Tom Wolfe as chronicler in â€œThe Right Stuff.â€ Apollo had the triumph of the Moon landing, the tragedy of Apollo 1 and the nail-biting return of crippled Apollo 13.[Readers tell us what they remember about the moon landing]Gemini, by contrast, is the middle child of the early space program, eager to please but apt to be ignored. And when it comes to saying the name aloud, there has always been some knee-eye confusion. In this newspaper, a seemingly authoritative 1965 article tried to resolve the â€œrunning debateâ€ with a statement from NASA that the proper pronunciation is â€œâ€˜Jiminy,' as in â€˜Jiminy Cricket.'â€On Tuesday, Bob Jacobs, a spokesman for NASA, said that the â€œkneeâ€ pronunciation is part of the agency's culture, and serves almost as an insider's shibboleth — a word whose proper delivery identifies you as someone in the know. â€œIf you get it right,â€ he said, â€œyou're part of the space club.â€ He likened it to the Nashville street Demonbreun, which is pronounced Da-MUN-bree-un, and not like what some have characterized as â€œdemon pickle juice.â€ Mr. Jacobs also suggested that the pronunciation could have to do with the early space program's Southernness, in the way that â€œevery pilot speaks like Chuck Yeager.â€And yet it wasn't always so clear, said Bill Barry, the space agency's chief historian. Back in the time of the Gemini program, â€œit kind of depended who you were talking to, and what day of the week it was,â€ and even varied from NASA locations, he said.For â€œFirst Man,â€ NASA arranged a meeting between the film's star, Ryan Gosling, and Michael Collins, a member of the Apollo 11 crew. Taking the opportunity, Dr. Barry asked Mr. Collins to resolve the question. â€œHe kind of gets this twinkle in his eye,â€ he recalled. â€œHe used the word â€˜Gemini' twice in his answer — and he pronounced it both ways.â€As for the filmmakers, Dr. Barry said that he suggested to them that for the sake of clarity, they pick one pronunciation and stick with it. â€œFrom my perspective, from 50 years later, whichever you want to use is fine.â€"
"Often, when actors or directors with Oscar contenders sit down opposite your Carpetbagger, I can sense the barely concealed anxiety underneath their brave faces. There are so many year-end movies jostling for award-season attention, and it's possible that their passion projects could get lost in the scrum.It was striking, then, when I recently met up with a relaxed and grinning John Krasinski, who's treating the awards run of â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ as an unexpected victory lap. Krasinski directed and starred in the postapocalyptic horror movie about a family besieged by sound-seeking monsters, and since â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ was an out-of-the-gate hit last spring, â€œit's nice to have the pressure off and have this be a celebration than for it to be an angsty, scary time,â€ Krasinski said.[Read our review of â€œA Quiet Place.â€]In a year with many populist contenders in the mix, including â€œA Star is Bornâ€ and â€œBlack Panther,â€ the team behind â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ now hopes to convert that box-office passion into award-season heat. So far, Krasinski's wife and co-star in the film, Emily Blunt, has picked up a SAG nomination for her work, and the movie has scored top 10 mentions from organizations like the National Board of Review and American Film Institute. That means Krasinski, 39, has spent almost an entire year promoting his film, but he's happy to overextend himself. â€œI do feel wiped,â€ he told me, â€œbut it's a whole different ballgame to be talking about something you love.â€Here are edited excerpts from our conversation:Your first breakthrough was as an actor on â€œThe Office,â€ which became a hit later into its run. By contrast, â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ was an overnight phenomenon. How did you experience that kind of success?â€œThe Officeâ€ was so gradual that there was time to process it, but with â€œA Quiet Place,â€ when you're fired out of a cannon, you don't really know you're in the air until you're almost on the way down. It's changed my life completely. It felt like this was a story I had always wanted to tell, and I didn't even know it was lacking in my life, so there was this satiation from it that I didn't realize I needed. When I was walking my daughter to school for the first time after we premiered at South by Southwest, I felt like, â€œYou're getting your full dad for the first time.â€What was that first public screening like? We were driving there, and my wife said: â€œWhat do you want to worry about? Focus on one thing, because if you worry about the whole movie, you'll drive yourself crazy.â€ I remembered [George] Clooney told me that they clapped at the end of [the drama he directed] â€œGood Night and Good Luck,â€ so I said, â€œIt'd be cool if they clapped.â€ Of course, I chose the end of the movie, which was stupid. She said: â€œO.K., just focus on that. Don't worry about what the audience does until that moment.â€When Emily cocked the gun at the end of the movie, they exploded. They jumped out of their seats, they were shaking the chairs. I remember that so clearly because Emily turned to me and screamed, â€œOh my God!â€ And very apropos, I couldn't hear because everyone was so loud. That's when I knew, â€œThere's something here.â€A horror movie is not unlike a comedy in that way: If it works, people have a visceral reaction to it.It's funny you [say that] because I really did take on this project because of some advice Greg Daniels gave me when I was working on â€œThe Office.â€ He told me, â€œYour job is not to deliver these lines funny. Your job is just to deliver these lines. If people find it funny, that's up to them — you just play the honesty of it.â€That's how I approached this movie, and I don't know if I would have done this had he not given me that advice. I would have gone in thinking, â€œI've got to scare people because this is a genre film,â€ and it would have been horrible.The film is expected to be a strong Oscar contender in the two sound categories, which people often mix up. Since sound was such an important part of your movie, it strikes me that you might be the perfect person to explain the difference between those two categories.There's sound mixing and editing. The editing is getting all the sounds in place, putting this sound next to that sound. Sound mixing is making sure they all come together to sound real. If crickets were as loud as the music, it would be insane: You have to diminish the crickets to whatever it's supposed to be to feel real. That whole idea, I thought I understood until I did this movie. It can either be a tool set that will fix things, or it can be a magic kit where you blow the lid off and start concocting potions of sound. That was mind-blowing to me.At the same time, if a movie really works, it may play well even without sound — when you're watching it over someone's shoulder on a plane, for instance.The truth is that I did that exactly for the first month of editing. On the first day or two, I was going through different sounds with my editor to equalize it out, and I just said, â€œHit mute.â€ And we hit mute for what might have been five weeks. The first cut and the second cut were all done without one ounce of sound. I needed to be able to connect with these characters without anything else.When you had that silent cut, did you ever think, â€œThis could practically be a complete film on its own?â€One hundred percent, and that sounds super pretentious, but it's true. Even on silent, there was so much communication happening. I didn't think our movie would be so commercially accepted because the only other time I've seen someone do a movie with no spoken dialogue is Paul Thomas Anderson at the beginning of â€œThere Will Be Blood.â€ That first 12 to 14 minutes where Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't speak was a huge touchstone for me.Paul Thomas Anderson hosted an award-season screening for your film. That's got to be gratifying.I think I've only told my wife this, so why not say it in an interview: That was the moment that was the most surreal of all this. He emailed me and said, â€œYou need to call me,â€ and we talked on the phone and he was so specific and so honest about the movie. He's been so kind to me through my career, but we were talking like we were on an even playing field and that tripped my wires. What I love most about Paul is that he loves movies.I'll tell you a big life lesson. Paul was over at my house, I think it was my 30th birthday party, and I had just seen a movie I didn't love. I said to him over a drink, â€œIt's not a good movie,â€ and he so sweetly took me aside and said very quietly, â€œDon't say that. Don't say that it's not a good movie. If it wasn't for you, that's fine, but in our business, we've all got to support each other.â€ The movie was very artsy, and he said, â€œYou've got to support the big swing. If you put it out there that the movie's not good, they won't let us make more movies like that.â€Dude, Paul Thomas Anderson is out there on the wall for us! He's defending the value of the artistic experience. He's so good that maybe you project onto him that he's allowed to be snarky, but he's the exact opposite: He wants to love everything because that's why he got into moviemaking. And ever since then, I've never said that I hate a movie.[John Krasinski explains how he went about writing â€œA Quiet Place.â€]You're writing a sequel to â€œA Quiet Place.â€ Does it worry you that the first film was such a big hit that Paramount may treat this like the â€œPurgeâ€ franchise, cranking out new installments on a yearly basis?Totally. I can't stop them from doing that. I'm a realist, I know how the studio operates. At first, I wanted nothing to do with a sequel — I told my wife, â€œIt can never be this good again.â€ And she said, â€œOf course it won't. Take this movie, put it on a mantel so you can look at it anytime you want, and then go out and do something else.â€Paramount was asking a bunch of writers and directors what they might do with it, and to their credit, they didn't take any of those pitches because they felt a little more franchise-y. Meanwhile, I had this tiny idea that fit that world and could be exciting. Paramount asked if I would write it and I'm doing that now, but I'm still thinking about what I want to do next. If I can crack the idea, I would love to direct it again, and if I can't, I would love to give it to someone else with my fingerprints on it to make sure it's being taken care of.I know that anyone reading this will be like, â€œYeah right, art guy,â€ but I do have sort of a parental feeling about this movie, and I don't want â€œA Quiet Placeâ€ to turn into an action movie where 400 people have machine guns. Or did I give away the ending to the sequel? [Laughs.]"
"Dear Match Book,I have the privilege of leading a spirituality group for homeless women at a day shelter. As a matter of policy, we do not discuss religion — both so that nonbelievers feel welcome, and also since many believers become upset when others don't share their particular views.To start things off each time we meet we often read a poem together. Over the years we have read Kabir, Hafiz and reams and reams of Mary Oliver. We've also covered Shakespeare's Sonnet 27 and â€œPhenomenal Woman,â€ by Maya Angelou. Our selections are often nature-focused, but sometimes they address human emotions and concerns, often explicitly or implicitly about spirituality. Some are about the sacredness of silence, and all are short and beautiful.Finding appropriate poems is really tough. Can you help us out?JOAN MAXWELLWASHINGTON, D.C.Dear Joan,â€œEvery poem is rooted in imaginative awe,â€ W. H. Auden said. No matter your congregants' spiritual inclinations, the distillation of language and thought can open a path to reverence, and a few moments of peace. For some, literature is the religion. Beginning each gathering with verse offers a gesture of comfort and hope.Old SoulsYou've read work by poets from 14th-century Iran (Hafiz) and 15th-century India (Kabir); have you tried the work of the 13th-century Sufi mystic poet Rumi? â€œThe Essential Rumi,â€ translated by Coleman Barks, includes three poems in particular (among many!) — â€œTwo Kinds of Intelligence,â€ â€œSay I Am Youâ€ and â€œThe Seed Marketâ€ — in which the metaphysical and the terrestrial mingle. Then, for more ancient beauty and even more brevity, try the 17th-century haikus of Matsuo Basho collected in â€œOn Love and Barley,â€ translated by Lucien Stryk. The Japanese Zen Buddhist's lines — full of cherry blossoms and â€œplum scentâ€ and a cricket's song — offer a transcendent connection to nature that spans centuries.Inside OutTwo contemporary poets who map external landscapes while navigating internal terrain may provide just what you need to spark discussion and reflection among the women in your group: â€œI used to pretend to believe in God. Mainly, I liked so much to talk to someone in the dark.â€ The first two lines of Ada LimÃ³n's â€œMiracle Fishâ€ give you a sense of the whole of her searching, vital collection, â€œBright Dead Things.â€ There are horses and trees and birds throughout — try â€œDrift,â€ â€œLies About Sea Creaturesâ€ and the startling and powerful â€œHow to Triumph Like a Girlâ€ — as well as plenty of space for believers and agnostics to meet.Faith surfaces frequently in â€œOtherwise,â€ the new and selected work by Jane Kenyon published in 1996, the year after she died. Many of Kenyon's poems are attuned to seasons, in both nature and life. And most are grave and still, though in certain entries — notably â€œEvening Sun,â€ â€œThingsâ€ and â€œLet Evening Comeâ€ — movement and light flash from line to line.Double TakesIn much of Joy Harjo's work belief takes shape as an origin story. Both â€œOnce the World Was Perfect,â€ from her 2015 book, â€œConflict Resolution for Holy Beings,â€ and â€œRemember,â€ from 1983's â€œShe Had Some Horses,â€ reveal the ties between selfhood and the wider, wild universe.Finally, â€œBlack Nature,â€ an anthology of nature poems by black writers edited by Camille T. Dungy, is an invaluable resource that you'll want to keep close at hand. A sprinkling of Richard Wright's haikus appear throughout the book's 10 thematically organized sections, creating witty respites amid the longer verse. The book's second poem, Lucille Clifton's â€œthe earth is a living thing,â€ evokes rich, mythic images of blackness — a bear, a hawk — to convey an encompassing vision of the world. The lens narrows in Robert Hayden's chilly, holy whisper, â€œIce Storm.â€ Bracing clarity also reigns in Marilyn Nelson's â€œLast Talk With Jim Hardwick,â€ which includes the line, â€œNothing is wasted / or permanently lost / in Nature,â€ and stretches down the page in an elegant strip, as deep and direct as a homily.Yours truly, Match BookDo you need book recommendations?

"Some things Tinder dates offered me (that are not sex): jars of jam, help hanging shelves, a ride to the airport, hangover sundae with peanuts, shortcuts across Durham, Costco visits, a planning commissioner's phone number, a medical consultation, a visit to a Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit, sympathy, homemade pumpkin bread, stories about their mothers, the best swimming holes, long hugs that stay hugs. I thought online dating would be about physical need, but instead I've experienced so many small intimacies. Still about need. Almost about love. — Sarah MorrisWe were online content moderators taking down nude photos. All day, we sorted through thousands of photos and messages flagged as inappropriate on a meet-up app. We sat nearby, but our office had a strict no-talking rule, so our relationship began in silence as we sent each other funny things we found via Gchat. This led to more messaging until one day we grew tired of talking about nudes and decided to see each other naked instead. — Kristine MurawskiThroughout my hardships with obsessive-compulsive disorder, parents, boyfriends and social media celebrities have sent me on a frantic and mostly unsuccessful search for self-love. I have tried to exude self-love in its various costumes — a perfect Instagram, an overflowing social calendar, a forced smile at the office. Yet these outward expressions aren't enough in the quiet moments when worry and doubt creep in. When all seems lost during solitary train rides home, my greatest triumph is finding the courage to whisper, â€œIt's all right. I'll get through this. I love you,â€ and boarding the train again. — M.C. ConnorsI was 30 and knew I couldn't have a baby. Accompanying my pregnant friend shopping one day, I pined over a striped onesie with a crab sewn on the backside. I told her if I ever had a son, I would want him to wear it. Eight days later, I went to church and saw an infant snuggled in his grandmother's arms. He was wearing the same onesie. At the end of that day's service, the reverend announced that the baby was in need of an immediate home. Two days later, he moved into mine. Now he's 5 and my son. — Sarah MouracadeWe were in my hammock when I looked at the socks I was wearing, the ones he had lent me, and told him the words I was so scared to say: â€œI love you.â€ The hammock swayed, crickets chirped. â€œThanks,â€ he said, â€œbut I don't yet.â€ He pointed at my feet. â€œThose don't fit me. Do you want them?â€ I thought the hammock had tipped, thrown me violently out; he didn't love me, this was it. But years later, we still lie in my hammock and I still wear those socks. He was right; they are too small for his feet. — Madeleine Fawcett"
"JALALABAD, Afghanistan — A suicide bomber attacked an election rally on Tuesday in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, killing at least 14 people and once again highlighting security concerns as candidates prepare for an Oct. 20 parliamentary vote amid a raging war.The attack struck at a gathering of about 300 supporters of the candidate Nasir Mohmand in Nangarhar's Kama district. Najibullah Kamawal, the province's director of public health, said at least 43 others were wounded. Officials feared the toll could rise.Mr. Mohmand survived, but with more than two weeks until Election Day, at least other seven candidates have already been killed across Afghanistan.Nangarhar has seen a drastic increase in violence in recent years, with the emergence of the Islamic State, which has its foothold in the province, adding to insecurity caused by the Taliban. Corruption and a heavy infiltration of mafia have complicated the situation, so much so that after back-to-back suicide bombings in the provincial capital, Jalalabad, the government recently changed all senior police officials and handed control of security to the army.In a separate incident on Tuesday in the province's Bati Kot District, explosives placed in a cricket field wounded seven children, according to Attaullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the provincial governor of Nangarhar. The children were aged between 12 and 15, and the condition of two was critical, he said.The parliamentary election, delayed by three years, comes amid rising violence nationwide. Nearly half of Afghan territory is controlled or influenced by a resurgent Taliban, forcing one-third of the polling stations to remain shut on Election Day. The Islamic State continues to claim deadly attacks in urban centers.A political crisis has also clouded the electoral process ahead of the vote, with political parties and the government clashing over what the parties fear is a government attempt to commit fraud regarding the number of people registered to vote.At least four provinces showed more than 100 percent of their estimated eligible voters registering, according to data from the election commission. Despite the poor security and voter fatigue because of flawed previous elections, the commission announced that about nine million people had registered to vote.Arguments over the voter rolls set off months of disagreements among the government, political parties and the election organizing body. Finally the parties' demand that voters be verified biometrically — mostly through fingerprints — was agreed to, but only after the parties had shut down several election offices across the country.Still, whether the crisis has genuinely been averted is unclear, as some are skeptical about the technical feasibility of rolling out biometric machines across about 21,00 polling stations in just a couple of weeks.Nevertheless, 2,565 candidates, 417 of them women, are taking risks to campaign this month, putting up posters and holding rallies. A large number of the candidates are young first-timers who are campaigning to change a Parliament notorious for its corruption."
"HOBART, Tasmania — There's a special kind of easygoing pleasure in eating your way through Tasmania's capital city these days, a sense that this is the exact right place and the exact right time for maximum 2019 deliciousness.The ingredients that create that impression are numerous. Hobart's compact size makes it manageable and walkable, while its hills-cascading-into-the-river beauty makes those walks especially lovely. Its architecture, much of it constructed from hefty convict-cut stone, creates many opportunities for spaces that feel like hidy-hole secrets — small, warm rooms concealed behind hulking old facades. The invigorated arts scene, thanks mainly to the innovative Museum of Old and New Art, has inspired a thriving culture of creativity. And the still (comparatively) reasonable rents have drawn an enthusiastic group of fresh-faced chefs and restaurateurs, eager to showcase the island state's unparalleled natural bounty.This confluence of prime dining conditions has not gone unnoticed by national and international media, and I'm almost certainly not the first person to tell you that Hobart is where it's at. Critical darlings have been anointed, most notably Analeise Gregory, the chef at Franklin, who not only serves sea urchin roe draped around linguine with wild fennel, but also dives for the spiny beasts herself. I've had wonderful meals at Franklin, and at the duly lauded Templo, and delicious but slightly fraught experiences at the Agrarian Kitchen, just out of town.But the most vivid impressions — enough to jolt me out of my pleasant Hobart eating reverie and into much more interesting territory — are the meals I've had at Dier Makr.[Don't miss Besha Rodell's next column. Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter for the best of our local and global coverage.]Though the restaurant has had its fair share of attention, it is often lumped in with other exciting Hobart restaurants, the fourth or fifth spot mentioned in a pack of favorites. Still, there's something going on in this odd little establishment that's especially exciting.Dier Makr is buried in the belly of an imposing gray building; a small sign in the front hallway encourages that â€œyou're going the right way.â€ In an interior room you'll find a small collection of tables, a counter that faces the kitchen and a glassed-in wine room. â€œKitchenâ€ is a bit of a misnomer: The chef, Kobi Ruzicka, and his staff cook on a collection of hot plates and small portable grills.When he opened Dier Makr in late 2016 with Sarah Fitzsimmons, a co-owner, they lacked the money for a proper kitchen. Mr. Ruzicka does not let his improvised cooking arrangement hold him back. (Ms. Fitzsimmons recently departed the business.) There's a particular bent to Mr. Ruzicka's culinary style, a layering of related but divergent flavors that borders on profound.During my first meal at Dier Makr, more than a year ago, I was knocked sideways by a dish that presented cauliflower in various states — purÃ©ed, in steamed florets and in lightly pickled slivers — along with raclette and hazelnuts. The pungent, gooey cheese brought out the vegetal funk of the cauliflower, each element amplifying the others. All of the good things about cauliflower were put in a new light, one so much bolder than any I'd experienced before.The fixed price for a seven-course meal was $65, which seemed incredibly cheap. The owners must have come to the same conclusion: Over the last 18 months the price went up incrementally, and is now $85.What you get for that $85 continues to thrill. A recent meal began with a shallow bowl of creamy mascarpone, topped with soft diced potatoes confited in butter. Ultrathin purple potato chips came alongside, with the instruction to treat the dish as a dip. It played out like a loaded baked potato that had been reimagined and deconstructed — familiar and comforting, but elemental and original.A decent portion of the meal is dedicated to snacking, the chips and dip followed by tiny tarts of tomatillo topped with creamy kingfish brandade, then raw carrots and radishes alongside a pool of labneh topped with an umami-rich paste made from fermented crickets and charred allium.Further into the evening, a bowl of dashi appeared, dotted with mysterious dark parcels, some of which turned out to be zucchini, others dumplings made from leek and mussels. I'd expected to be wooed by the latter, but the dumpling wrappers were a little tough and clumsy. The revelation came with the zucchini, which was so soft it collapsed in on itself and revealed a plush, luxurious quality I'd never known in zucchini before.The glassed-in wine room plays a refreshingly interactive part in your meal: Rather than refer to a list, you're invited to peruse the room the way you would a wine shop. A waiter will accompany you and help as much as is needed, or you can take your time and rely on the tasting notes written on cards hung round each bottle's neck. It's not a huge collection, but it is very well chosen, showcasing the most interesting things happening in Australian winemaking alongside smaller producers from Europe.Wine has been a focus for Mr. Ruzicka and Ms. Fitzsimmons all along, and in November they opened a wine bar called Lucinda in a street-facing space in the front of the building. Lucinda's menu is, on its face, more straightforward than Dier Makr's, with dishes like mozzarella panzanela, or roast potatoes with gribiche. But here, too, Mr. Ruzicka finds ways to make you sit up and take notice: mustard greens dressed in an XO sauce that is boldly pungent with fermented seafood; pickled rhubarb on a cheese plate that sings with acidic personality.Mr. Ruzicka moved to Hobart from his hometown, Melbourne, almost on a whim; he says Dier Makr could never have come about back there. This is the promise of Hobart: that the next generation of talented chefs is able to spin its own weird and beautiful stories here without too much compromise.Thank the low rents, thank the beauty, thank the art museum, thank the amazing produce, thank the creative community that flourishes here. But however you spin it, it's Melbourne's loss.Do you have a suggestion for Besha Rodell?

"BRAMPTON, Ontario — It was supposed to be a dream family vacation.An immigrant grandfather eager to set foot on African soil after an absence of 30 years.A doting mother determined to show her Canadian daughters where she came from.Two teenage girls giddy at the prospect of seeing animals on safari in Kenya.Instead, three generations of an Indian-Canadian family perished when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, including 18 Canadians.â€œI am not angry, but I am devastated. I have lost everyone,â€ said Manant Vaidya, 41, whose parents, sister, brother-in-law and two teenage nieces all died in the crash, which had victims from 25 countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia, China and the United States.[Read our latest coverage of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.]In Brampton, Ontario, a multicultural suburban city outside Toronto where Punjabi is the second-most spoken language after English, the tight-knit South Asian community is in shock at the deaths of Mr. Vaidya's mother, Hansini Vaidya, 67; father, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73; sister Kosha Vaidya, 37; brother-in-law Prerit Dixit, 45; and two teenage nieces Ashka Dixit, 14, and Anushka Dixit, 13.They are mourning, Mr. Vaidya said, for a family that embodied the â€œCanadian dream.â€Within hours of the crash, the mayor ordered that flags at city hall be lowered to half-staff to honor the family. Flags were also lowered at the girls' schools.On Tuesday, a steady stream of neighbors and relatives dropped by the handsome house in Brampton where Mr. Vaidya and his family had lived with his parents, offering condolences and care packages of food.On Monday, Sushma Swaraj, the Indian foreign minister, called to express her condolences.The family, meanwhile, was discussing how to find hair samples or dental records of their dead relatives for DNA testing. They said they despaired at the possibility of not being to able to identify the bodies so that the family could be cremated in their native Gujarat in accordance with Hindu ritual.[Read answers to frequently asked questions about Boeing's 737 Max 8.]â€œI last saw them on Saturday morning when I dropped them off at the airport,â€ Mr. Vaidya said.A friend from Nairobi called the next day to tell him the news.â€œI couldn't believe it at first,â€ Mr. Vaidya said, adding that the family had feared breaking the news to his mother's 90-year-old mother, back in India.Mr. Vaidya said his family were typical first-generation Indian immigrants, with five groups of relatives living within five minutes of one another in Brampton, presided over by his parents.They were surrogate parents, mentors and therapists to the entire clan, he said, many of whose immediate family was in India.Pannagesh Vaidya, a gentle, soft-spoken man with a ready smile, had been chief executive of an engineering consulting business, his son said, and enjoyed tutoring his grandchildren in math, doing equations in his head.At weekly family get-togethers, overflowing with naan bread and dal, along with pizza, Ashka would sing and Anushka would do classical Indian dances. Anushka aspired to be a robotics engineer.â€œThe two girls were born here and were Canadian girls,â€ Mr. Vaidya said. â€œThe whole family believed Canada was a land of opportunity.â€Mr. Vaidya said his sister immigrated to Ontario in 2003, to join her husband, who had arrived from India in the 1990s, in search of a better life. About nine years later, her parents joined them from India.The Canadian cold had initially been a culture shock to his father, he said. â€œBut my father said better to stay indoors and be close to family.â€Hiral Vaidya, Mr. Vaidya's wife, recalled that her mother-in-law was deeply religious. Every morning she woke up to do puja, a Hindu ritual in which she paid homage to Indian deities, including the powerful Shiva.Before the Ethiopian Air flight, she said, Hansini Vaidya woke at 3 a.m. and spent two hours praying for a safe journey. â€œShe wouldn't eat or do anything until she had prayed,â€ she said.Mr. Dixit thought a lot about plane safety, Mr. Vaidya said, and, before the flight, had assiduously studied the safety record of the Boeing 737 Max 8, along with the airline's track record.He said his brother-in-law had felt confident because it was a new plane. â€œHe did his homework,â€ Mr. Vaidya said.The senior Vaidyas had met in an arranged marriage in Gujarat, but love soon took over. Mr. Vaidya said his father financed his mother's education as an architect. â€œHe was part of the older generation, but respected his wife having a career,â€ he said.The family embodied the work ethic of new immigrants.Mr. Vaidya said his brother-in-law, a passionate photographer, worked two jobs, seven days a week when he first came to Canada, including as a lab technician for the Canadian Ministry of Health.His sister, an extrovert with a zest for travel, worked in the human resources department of the Canadian Hearing Society, which provides services for deaf people.Nikita Joshi, one of her closest friends, said she was determined to travel as broadly as possible before her daughters started university.She had checked off Alaska, Mexico and Hawaii, and was eager to show her daughters Mombasa, Kenya, where she had been born when her father was working there decades earlier.After Kenya, she had planned to take the family to London to watch cricket, to India to see her family, and to Dubai.The girls swam, followed soccer, listened to girl bands and joined the family on Bollywood film nights.â€œThe closeness in their family was so nice,â€ said Ashka's music teacher, Pramesh Nandi. â€œThey were like made for each other, all four of them.â€â€œI'm not ready to believe that they are not here,â€ he added. â€œI keep thinking that someone will come here and say that they're still alive and they're enjoying the trip in Africa.â€As a succession of countries, including Germany, Britain, France, Australia and Oman, grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 planes on Tuesday, the family asked why Canada had not joined other countries in doing so.â€œSomeone needs to step up and take responsibility for this tragedy so this doesn't happen to another family, and lives are lost in the air,â€ said Premal Vyas, a relative. â€œWe have a lot of questions, but very few answers.â€"
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)Good morning. U.S. candidates deliver closing statements, Pakistan caves in to protesters, Afghan migrants take cricket to France. Here's what you need to know: â€¢ U.S. election nears.The tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign barreled through its final weekend and toward the day of decision, Tuesday.The most prominent campaigners are on opposite sides of the country's vast political divide. President Trump has been crisscrossing the country to deliver fear-based messages on immigration and other issues. Former President Barack Obama has been assailing him in a surprisingly sharp, systematic way.Our live polling has many races too close to call, but there's a consensus in both parties that Democrats could take control of the House — and that the outlook for the Senate is unclear.We have an overview of the election and scenes from around the U.S.And The Times Magazine looks at an issue shadowing the country: the rise of white nationalism and domestic terrorism, which has flummoxed law enforcement. The far-right groups thrive online and have been increasingly emboldened since Mr. Trump took office._____â€¢ Pakistan yields to protesters.Asia Bibi, a Christian woman acquitted last week of blasphemy charges and ordered freed, remains in Pakistan. Above, her three daughters.On Friday, the government made a deal to halt hard-line Islamist groups' huge protests over the Supreme Court's ruling, which had brought parts of the country to a standstill. The deal prevents Ms. Bibi from leaving the country while the case is reviewed and appealed, a process that could add years of detention to the eight she spent on death row.Over the weekend, her lawyer fled the country for his own safety._____â€¢ â€œThe biggest mistake the Hong Kong government has ever made.â€That was a legal expert, commenting on the decision last month to expel Victor Mallet, the Asia news editor of The Financial Times.His work visa was rejected without explanation weeks after he presided over an event at the Foreign Correspondents' Club with an activist who advocates independence from China, Andy Chan. Above, flags of Hong Kong and China.The move — a first for the semiautonomous territory, which long prided itself for freedom of expression — refocused attention on the independence movement, drew sharp questions from diplomats and cast a dark shadow over Hong Kong's reputation as an unfettered financial and commercial hub.The private business community shares the alarm of foreign media organizations, and some see a reason to relocate operations to Singapore._____â€¢ Ozone-depleting gas traced. An environmental group has found new evidence that rogue factories in China are behind the resurgence of a banned gas that destroys the ozone layer and contributes to global warming.The ozone layer protects the earth from ultraviolet solar radiation. After a giant hole appeared in the layer in 1985, much of the world signed on to the Montreal Protocol outlawing CFC-11, used mostly in refrigerators and air-conditioners. Without that landmark treaty, the entire ozone layer would have collapsed by 2050, according to some studies.But in May, scientists found atmospheric levels of the gas were falling more slowly than expected. A Times investigation pointed to scrappy, small-scale factories across China, findings confirmed by the new study.Chinese authorities have pledged to stamp out the illicit production, but under-the-radar producers and a lack of measuring equipment are obstacles._____â€¢ Since President Trump took office, there has been a sharp decline in financial penalties against banks and big companies accused of malpractice, a Times investigation found.â€¢ Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, bought back nearly $1 billion of its own stock during its blockbuster third quarter.â€¢ Apple's decision to limit disclosures — including how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter — and its disappointing forecast for fourth-quarter sales dragged down its stock.â€¢ The latest U.S. jobs report painted an ideal picture of the economy. But there are three factors that will determine if the hot market will last.â€¢ Coming this week: American sanctions against Iranian oil go into effect. But some of the country's biggest importers — India, South Korea, Japan and China — are said to be exempted for six months.â€¢ New York City Marathon: Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia pulled ahead late to win the men's race in 2:05:59. Mary Keitany of Kenya, above, won the women's race in 2:22:48. [The New York Times]â€¢ A truck driver in northwestern China lost control, crashing into 31 cars, killing at least 13 people and injuring more than 40. [CNN]â€¢ Also in China: Many internet users expressed fury over a video showing a woman in Chongqing attacking the driver of a bus for skipping her stop just before it plunged into the Yangtze River, killing at least 13 people. [The New York Times]â€¢ Amal Hussain, the emaciated 7-year-old Yemeni girl whose haunting portrait in The Times drew an impassioned response from readers, died, underscoring the immense human toll of the Saudi-led war. [The New York Times]â€¢ An Australian nun, Sister Patricia Fox, who criticized the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, returned home six months after he ordered her arrest and deportation. [The New York Times]â€¢ Most of Sri Lanka's lawmakers refused to recognize the prime minister abruptly appointed by the president, and some said they had been offered bribes, amid an escalating political crisis on the island nation. [The New York Times]â€¢ A man-eating tiger in India that had been blamed for the deaths of 13 people was killed after a monthslong hunt that involved drones, elephants and a bottle of cologne. [The New York Times]â€¢ Novak Djokovic lost to the Russian player Karen Khachanov in the Paris Masters tennis tournament, ending a 22-game winning streak. [ESPN]Tips for a more fulfilling life.â€¢ Recipe of the day: Pack a lunch of farro salad with beets, their greens and salty feta.â€¢ Don't be a sucker when buying a used phone.â€¢ Fix your sleep habits and schedule. Then see about some gadgets.â€¢ Afghan migrants have taken their passion for cricket to France. And it's helping them integrate with the local community.â€¢ Mickey Mouse turns 90 this year, and Disney is deploying an enormous global marketing campaign to celebrate one of its oldest characters.â€¢ In memoriam: Raymond Chow, 91, the famed Hong Kong film producer who turned Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan into international stars and transformed the action film genre.Stickers can be surprisingly motivating, even for adults.At least that's the idea behind the â€œI Votedâ€ stickers handed out on Election Day in the U.S. — that they'll encourage voters to turn out, and inspire those who see them to vote themselves. (Election Day is Tuesday.)The stickers first appeared in the 1980s, offered by businesses, unions and civic groups. State and local governments began making their own.While some states keep it simple, others take the opportunity to express their identities. Some stickers, like Alabama's, Ohio's and Tennessee's, incorporate the shape of the state. Georgia's use the state's famous peach, while California's is in 13 languages.Alaskans who voted early this year got stickers with cartoon versions of state animals. Louisiana's stickers, which feature the Cajun artist George Rodrigue's iconic â€œBlue Dog,â€ have appeared on eBay.New York City has its own subway-themed sticker.

By the time you read this briefing, the United States will have reimposed severe economic sanctions on Iran and financial penalties for those who continue to import Iranian goods. Above, Iranian rials at a currency exchange shop in Basra, Iraq.The reinstated sanctions threaten to widen a rift between the U.S. and its European allies, who have criticized President Trump for abandoning the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.But the U.S. undercut its own sanctions by granting six-month waivers to eight countries — including India, South Korea, Japan and China, among the world's largest importers of Iranian oil. The E.U. did not receive an exemption.Separately, Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, has been lobbying Washington to save his companies from Trump administration sanctions. His efforts may prove successful._____â€¢ In Germany, one of the longest dry spells on record has left part of the Rhine, above, at record-low levels for months, causing havoc for many European businesses.Around 80 percent of the cargo transported by ship in Germany travels the Rhine, which many freighters have had to stop plying. Gas stations reliant on the river for fuel delivery from the Netherlands have run dry, and a German chemical plant that uses the Rhine's water had to trim back production.Europeans are bracing for further instability, with one researcher predicting that because of a warming climate, â€œthe extremes are going to happen more often.â€Separately, an environmental group has found new evidence that rogue factories in China are behind the resurgence of the banned gas CFC-11, which destroys the ozone layer and contributes to global warming._____â€¢ Paradise or â€œDeath Islandâ€?The Thai island of Koh Tao, above, is popular with Western tourists. But at least nine European visitors have died or disappeared there since 2014, and a rape allegation by a 19-year-old British woman has raised new questions about how the police handle serious crimes against tourists.The police said they had found no evidence to support the rape allegation and arrested 12 people who had posted about it on Facebook.â€¢ McKinsey, Booz Allen Hamilton and Boston Consulting have all continued work with Saudi Arabia even as investors distance themselves after the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

"The profile of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world, may have risen when it was showcased in the Oscar-winning movie â€œSlumdog Millionaire,â€ but my tour guide didn't particularly care about that at the moment. What concerned him more was the pejorative nature of the word â€œslumâ€ and how outsiders perceived Dharavi, an area smaller than New York City's Central Park but where about a million people live and work.â€œWe don't want people to think slums are dangerous and full of lazy people,â€ said Hitesh Vaidya, a guide for Reality Tours and Travel. The reality of daily life in Dharavi is sobering, however: Laborers work in unsafe conditions, and a lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation facilities endangers the health of residents. Mr. Vaidya and I spent the next couple of hours touring the many different industries and businesses within Dharavi, which included plastics recycling, textile manufacturing and food production. I left with a better knowledge of both the poverty and industriousness of Dharavi, as well as an understanding of Mr. Vaidya's point: that the two are not mutually exclusive.Mumbai (sometimes called by its former name, Bombay) is an electric and complicated city, an extraordinary place, both uplifting and heartbreaking. Its eclectic composition of different groups and cultures makes it a difficult city to define, but for many, it's a city that represents possibility. Dharmesh Gandhi, a friend who lives in Mumbai, offered his take on India's financial center and one of the world's most populous cities: â€œIt's like New York,â€ he said. â€œEverything is happening here, so everyone wants to come here.â€ After a four-day visit this past October, it was easy to see why: The shopping and entertainment options were excellent, and opportunities for great dining were second-to-none. And while the rupees flow freely in Mumbai, I was able to keep my spending under control.A couple of logistical items: My flight, booked through Jet Airways, cost a bit over $200 for a one-way flight from Sri Lanka. As I was re-entering India, I had to produce my double-entry e-visa once more to passport control. My Uber ride from the airport was about 370 rupees, or a little more than $5. If you'd prefer not to use Uber, another popular service is Ola Cabs. I used both while in Mumbai, typically opening both apps and using whichever had a car closer to me. The ubiquitous tuk-tuk is conspicuously absent in much of Mumbai (â€œThe traffic here is bad enough,â€ Mr. Gandhi told me). In central Mumbai, you'll just see regular taxis. Fortunately, they're metered, with fares beginning at 22 rupees.I was well-located in the Fort neighborhood of the city, close to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station, the huge Victorian landmark constructed in the late 19th century. My quarters at the Hotel Residency Fort, Mumbai, booked for $52 a night on Hotels.com, were modest luxury, roomy and air-conditioned, and with free breakfast.A walk around the neighborhood was the first order of business: A stop by Mumbai's first Anglican church, St. Thomas Cathedral, established in 1718, was followed by a visit to the free Jehangir Art Gallery near Wellington Fountain. I enjoyed the Nayanaa Kanodia exhibition, â€œThe Quintessential Woman: A Celebration,â€ which featured oil paintings and drawings celebrating feminism. Another exhibition, â€œRural Beauty,â€ featured darker, more sensual pencil and pastel works by Parshuram B. Patil.There are numerous fine museums in Mumbai, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India). Admission is 500 rupees, plus an additional 50-rupee fee to take cellphone photos. The main hall of the museum, which features Rajastani temple columns and wooden railings from a nobleman's home, is topped with a great Islamic dome — a nod to Mumbai's diverse history.There are some wonderful statues of Indian deities on the ground floor — Shiva, Ganesh, Brahma and Vishnu, some dating as far back as the sixth century. I also enjoyed looking at a series of paintings from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, done in the Rajasthani Bikaner style, particularly one depicting a scene from the Mahabharata epic.My favorites, though, were probably the later work of Jehangir Sabavala, a Mumbai-born artist who died in 2011 at age 89. His paintings, which intriguingly join East with West, have elements of both Cubism and Impressionism. I particularly liked â€œThe Eye,â€ as well as his somber â€œThe Raven,â€ 2010 works that were two of Sabavala's final pieces.The most interesting museum I visited, however, proved to be the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum, which claims to be Mumbai's very first, established in 1872 (100 rupees admission). The building itself is quite beautiful, and houses interesting artifacts like old model ships, ganjifa — round playing cards that became popular under Mughal emperors in the 16th century — and examples of pottery from the Sir J.J. School of Art near the turn of the 20th century. Particularly interesting was an exhibition documenting the movement of peoples to Mumbai over the years, from the Kolis fishermen of Gujarat in the 13th century to the Parsi, Surati and Khoja people that immigrated with the rise of the East India Company.But it's not just the past that impresses in Mumbai — the present is pretty happening, too. I headed to the club the Quarter one evening to catch a show with Azamaan Hoyvoy and his pseudo-funk trio (750 rupees for a standing ticket). They grooved through a number of pretty good covers, including â€œHow Deep Is Your Loveâ€ and Allen Stone's â€œUnaware.â€ Cocktails at the Quarter run in the 600 rupee range, but you can get a Kingfisher beer for 275.I spent another evening at Shanmukhananda Hall, a large auditorium near the King's Circle train station, to take in a Lucky Ali concert (1,500 rupees, purchased through the website Book My Show). Lucky Ali, a Mumbai-born musician, went through crowd-pleasing soft rock favorites with a six-piece band. Between numbers, he took the opportunity to speak on various issues. â€œIf Ganga goes, where do we go?â€ he asked, referring to the Ganges River. â€œI think half of you probably haven't even been there. Go there! Plant some trees or something.â€About two-and-a-half miles to the southwest is Siddhi Vinayak Mandir, a beautiful temple dedicated to Ganesha and an essential place of worship for many Mumbai Hindus. I arrived just in time one evening for a puja, and after leaving my shoes at a counter outside, was ushered in to the sound of clapping, drums, bells and the smell of incense. A small, serene-looking Ganesha statue sat among orange and white flowers while a group of about 150 of us stood engaged in an intense, rhythmic call-and-response that changed tempos and melodies throughout the course of the next 30 minutes. For those looking to worship in a hurry, a â€œquick darshanâ€ line can be entered for a payment of 50 rupees.Any explorer of Mumbai will eventually need to try one of thousands of street vendors and restaurants that grace the city. Fortunately, there is no shortage of good options, and nearly every price point is covered. The Bombay street sandwich is one you'll see everywhere and, if you're feeling adventurous, certainly worth trying. A typical example features sliced cucumber, potato, onion, tomato and beetroot on toasted bread, served with a variety of spicy chutneys. At 25 or 30 rupees, it's an absolute steal.Mumbai's reputation for street food par excellence is well deserved, and on Sheikh Memon Street, near the Juma Masjid mosque, I indulged in another treat: a plate of dahi puri (40 rupees), savory chickpeas stuffed into flaky puri shells, drenched in tart yogurt and dusted with spices and herbs. And no Mumbai street food discussion is complete without mentioning vada pav, the quintessential carbohydrate bomb that features a fried potato fritter squished into soft white roll (about 10 rupees, and it can be found all over).The city does upscale dining with equal aplomb. Prateek Sadhu and Aditi Dugar own Masque, an elegantly repurposed industrial space that serves a 10-course tasting menu every day except Monday. The wine pairing alone, however, costs 6,000 rupees — it's not exactly a place for penny-pinchers. Fortunately, Masque offers a bar menu for walk-ins like me looking for a lighter meal.A very good sour eggplant toast (350 rupees), sweetened with tamarind and covered with caramelized onions, functioned as a kind of tangy eggplant pÃ¢tÃ©. A twist on pani puri, the classic street food, filled the thin shells with a cactus salad and corn mousse (350 rupees). Something described as pork okonomiyaki (500 rupees) really was like a sweet-glazed pork taco, competently prepared and served with a nice cabbage slaw. My server, Ayush, was particularly good and made me feel right at home.Somewhere in the middle, you've got Gurukripa, an all-day casual vegetarian restaurant in the Sion neighborhood. There's an exceptionally good pav bhaji (96 rupees), a tomato-y mash of spiced vegetables served with a slab of rapidly melting butter. White rolls, crunchy papadum and a sharp onion salad round out the meal. Or there's Ling's Pavilion, a Mumbai institution, where the steamed pork with salted fish (500 rupees) and creamy fried corn curd (275 rupees) will help explain the country's love of Chinese food.And don't forget the shopping. At the excellent Kitab Khana bookstore, I perused the sizable section entitled â€œBooks on Gandhi and by Gandhiâ€ before settling on Mohandas K. Gandhi's autobiography, â€œThe Story of My Experiments with Truth,â€ for just 156 rupees. Another day, I set out in search of spices and ended up at Lalbaugh Market near Chinchpokli Station. Wandering down Dinshaw Petit Road, I followed the sound of loud, metallic pounding until I ended up at Vishwas, a specialty spice store where a shopkeeper was in the process of mashing a red substance into fine powder. I asked for haldi, or turmeric, and the man behind the counter spooned a 200-gram plastic bagful for 60 rupees.But the best way to get a feel for the city might be to walk along Fashion Street on a weekend afternoon. Fashion Street is on the western edge of Fort, along Mahatma Gandhi Road, flanking a big public park, Azad Maidan, and branching off into Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Road to the south. On the street, packed solid with shoppers, are hundreds of stalls containing anything you could possibly want to wear — dresses, T-shirts, jeans and accessories.I picked up a shirt for 250 rupees and, after a bit of haggling over the initial ask of 1,000, walked away with a pair of jeans for 600 rupees. Satisfied with my haul, I walked through the Karnatak Sports Ground, where organized teams were playing games of cricket. As the sun began to set, I crossed the street to Azad Maidan, past food vendors selling snacks and couples lounging on the grass while groups of boys played decidedly more casual pickup cricket games with tennis balls.Over a good dinner at the Parsi restaurant Ideal Corner, I reflected on my time in a city that has so much to offer — too much for one trip, certainly. Some trips are draining, but Mumbai left me feeling energized. I would have to return again to this dynamic city, and soon."
"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion.April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season.â€œThat's amazing, isn't it?â€ Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final.But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke.Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia's 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup.Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women's season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami.There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men's doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas.The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday's victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.â€œIf you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,â€ Bob Bryan said.Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova.Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak.But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women's tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980.Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors â€œweâ€ and â€œteamâ€ more than â€œIâ€ when discussing her rise.)Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday's final.But it is Barty's tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed.Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova's six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova's 66 percent.Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace.Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women's tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm.â€œI have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,â€ Barty said. â€œIt's always about trying to neutralize what your opponent's doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women's tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women's side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points.â€She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova's flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential.â€œI think I was an average cricketer, and I'm becoming a better tennis player,â€ she said. â€œIt was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling.â€So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige.Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well."
"The morning of my wedding, I woke up looking grotesque.I could hardly open my eyes because my eyelids were so swollen. In despair, I called out to Damian, my soon-to-be-husband. Then we called my doctor, who said, â€œLooks like your bone marrow transplant came to your wedding.â€I had received a bone-marrow transplant several years earlier, which vanquished the leukemia in my blood and saved my life. But my new immune system sometimes went haywire. Submerging myself in the hotel bathtub the night before with a moist, fragrant washcloth over my eyes had probably been a bad idea; it likely vexed my sensitive system.Or maybe this was caused by stress? It hurt to look at myself. Why did my body have to go rogue today of all days?Just two and a half years before, I didn't think this day would happen. At lunch with my mother, I said, â€œMom, I'm probably not going to find a partner.â€ I was 30 then and full-body irradiation had made me infertile. â€œI'm not what guys are looking for.â€I wasn't sad about this. On the contrary, I felt relieved. Finally free from hope and longing. But my mother couldn't stop crying.â€œI'm going to be O.K.,â€ I said.The next day I boarded a plane for Arkansas and a Buddhist retreat center in the Ozark Mountains I had been to before. When I was ill, my parents worried I wasn't turning to Jesus, but Buddhism seemed to make more sense. My life had become an immersive education in impermanence and suffering.After releasing the pressure of needing to partner, after making my mother cry, I arrived at the retreat center. And there was Damian, wearing tan cargo pants, a beige button-down shirt and a Tilley hat. He looked Australian, but I knew he was British.I knew because I had heard about him during a previous visit, when I met his then-wife, Angela. Damian's green card had expired and he was stuck in England, unaware that Angela was lusting after a new guy. I actually advised her to ditch the new guy and stay with her husband, because he sounded so awesome. I even emailed her afterward to encourage her again, and I was sad when I learned they had divorced.â€œSo, you're the Damian I've heard so much about,â€ I said.With a new green card, he was there for the same retreat and was helping build cabins for the center. I knew from Angela that he was in his late 40s, but he looked closer to my age.Damian would later say that after he met me, he kept thinking, â€œWhere's Ibby?â€ I did get the sense he was always finding me around the center, but not in a creepy way — more how a Labrador greets you at the door, tail wagging, ready to receive you.I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle rugged conditions, so I chose to camp the first night, but I didn't know how to set up my borrowed tent, so Damian set it up with me.As I organized my things, Damian lay half in the tent staring at the stars. He later told me he kept thinking he should leave, but he felt remarkably comfortable. I kept thinking he should stay, because I was afraid to camp alone. But I decided that sharing a tent with a stranger wasn't the best way to start a meditation retreat.And this was a silent retreat, or meant to be. The first day, I was eating lunch on the ledge of a cabin. With no room next to me, Damian plopped himself on the grass directly in front, grinning. I found the obviousness of his interest refreshing, but I couldn't say anything, so I stood up and moved next to him on the grass and we ate our lunch quietly, staring at a cabin wall.The second day, eating lunch under a tree, we watched a cricket jump onto another cricket and they started mating. Talk about an awkward silence!We went for a walk to a swimming hole, where we skipped rocks. Then I broke the silence. I had been sick, I told him, and I didn't want to waste my time or his, so I asked him every question I could think of. Do you like your mother? What about children? Cats or dogs? Would you get married again? Do you mind that my ovaries don't work?All those questions, and not one red flag.Damian wasn't fazed by my cancer-survivor status either. I was healthy by then, with a negligible chance of relapse, but my immune system could be wonky. I have already been through menopause, and I can no longer make tears — all side effects of the treatment that gave me more time on earth.Illness changes you in nonphysical ways too, aging your spirit. It can make you wiser but also more aware and scared of life's potential for pain.â€œWell,â€ Damian said, â€œyou seem fearless to me.â€On the third day, he kissed me. Then he told me he loved me.â€œNo, it's too soon!â€ I said. Then I remembered the meditation instructor told us to â€œbe spacious.â€ Maybe that meant, don't freak out?What I wanted was a man I could admire and a love that was abundantly clear. Damian was unafraid, attentive, generous and compassionate. It seemed as soon as I had let go of my hope and longing, he appeared.By the end of the retreat, I knew that while there had been life before Damian, now there could only be life with him.My parents, however, were not happy when I told them about him and us, concerned about our age difference and Damian's previous marriage.My father, an attorney, said, â€œWhen one of my clients wants to marry a divorced man, I tell her to talk to the ex-wife first.â€â€œBut Dad, I did that.â€He also worried that Damian, who designs, builds and remodels homes, wasn't a college graduate. I had an answer for this too.The year Damian was sorting out his green card, the BBC interviewed him for a story about the benefits of meditation. Because he had meditated for more than 10,000 hours, neurologists figured his brain activity might look different from the brain of an average person, so they put him into an M.R.I. machine.â€œMeet Damian, a man who can seemingly turn happiness on,â€ the reporter, David Sillito, said, adding that the neurologist who read Damian's M.R.I. had called his brain â€œbeautiful.â€ I sent the link to my father.â€œNo one's ever said that about my brain,â€ he replied.But the morning of our wedding, not even Damian could turn on my happiness. I had become Buddhist, found the retreat center and met the man I love because I once had cancer. Still, if ever there was a day that I didn't want to be reminded of this, it was today, and it was staring me in the face.My doctor prescribed antibiotics, Benadryl and steroids. Damian and I sat on the edge of the bed and meditated for an hour, which was our practice at the time. Then he went off with his best man and I tried to pull myself together. At the salon, as my hair was being twisted into a bun, my mother begged me to stop being so upset, saying it would only make my eyes worse.Damian says that my family, which is prone to stress-induced squabbles, didn't have a chance to fight that day because my eyelids elicited such sympathy. That's a very Buddhist interpretation. All I can say is I wish my eyelids had asked permission before sacrificing themselves to keep the peace.But later, as my mother and sister and sister-in-law helped me into my wedding gown, I looked in the mirror and thought, â€œWow, I actually look pretty.â€ One — or all three — of the drugs had worked. The swelling had left in its wake a burnt orange color that looked like makeup on my eyelids.Still, I didn't really arrive to my own wedding day until the doors to the chapel opened and I saw my niece dropping petals on the path I was about to walk. Everyone I love was there, staring at me, smiling. Some were crying. I just kept walking.We had a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony in a glass and wooden chapel in the woods of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. We included a Bible reading about love, since our families are Catholic, but most of the ceremony was in Tibetan: chants sung by a monk, accompanied by the ringing of a bell. Damian and I sat together silently, soaking it all in, as I experienced firsthand how suffering can transform into something beautiful."
"The greatest bowling scene in American literature, worth slipping on a pair of tricolor slippers to read, is almost certainly the one that opens William Kennedy's novel â€œBilly Phelan's Greatest Gameâ€ (1978).Kennedy's prose has as much mustard on it as does one of Billy's throws. A substantial bet has been placed. Billy bowls a strike, and it's â€œnot just another strike, but a titanic blast this time which sent all pins flying pitward, the cleanest of clean hits, perfection unto tidiness, bespeaking power battening on power, control escalating.â€Why there isn't more bowling writing in our fiction is a mystery. Surely the problem can't be the game's relatively low status. (Paul Fussell once proposed a map of the least classy places to live in America, based on ample access to bowling.) Bowling alleys seem a potent setting for drama; a playwright could set a wax-floor update of â€œThe Iceman Comethâ€ on Lane 11.Elizabeth McCracken's new novel, â€œBowlaway,â€ is a paean to candlepin bowling, a less-whacking variant of the sport. It employs thinner pins and a ball the size of a grapefruit with no finger holes. Bowlers are given three tosses a turn, not two. The game is popular in New England. There are no candlepin alleys in New York City.With this novel McCracken has, to borrow a term from cricket, bowled a googly. â€œBowlawayâ€ is a large and caterwauling sort of opera buffa, packed with outsize characters — some with recherchÃ© talents — and wild, often dreamlike events. If this novel were a bar, it would be the kind of joint where the Christmas lights are left on all year long.This is McCracken's third novel, and there's been a wait for it. (She has also written two books of stories and a memoir.) Her last novel, â€œNiagara Falls All Over Again,â€ which tracks a pair of comedy partners from vaudeville to Hollywood, appeared 18 years ago.Her first, a favorite of mine, a little heartbreaker of a book written with command and magic, is titled â€œThe Giant's House.â€ It was published in 1996. It's about a librarian and her love for a very tall, very literate boy who is dying. It's the sort of novel, I recall writing at the time, you want to sleep with under your pillow.In the nearly two decades between her last novel and this one, there has been some tragedy in the author's life. Her memoir, â€œAn Exact Replica of a Figment of My Imaginationâ€ (2008), is about the child she lost, in her ninth month of pregnancy, while living in a remote part of France.Some of the sorrow in that memoir seeps over into â€œBowlaway.â€ More than one woman in this novel has lost a child. The writing on this topic makes for close to unbearable reading.â€œPeople, women especially, are leery of mothers of dead children, or too gentle around them,â€ McCracken writes. â€œThe bereaved mother is a combustible gas, the baby is a match; which one is dangerous makes no difference but best keep them apart. LuEtta couldn't think of a way to ask that didn't make her seem more dangerous. She saw she might never be allowed to hold anyone's baby again.â€This substrata of despondency adds ballast to a novel that sometimes seems to want to drift off, like a hot-air balloon, into an ionospheric layer of pure twinkle and whimsy.This is the sort of novel in which nearly every character has an offbeat name (Leviticus Sprague, Cracker Graham, LuEtta Mood) and can seem more like a collection of quirks than a human being. One man blinks like a circus bear and has hands as brown as paws. Another speaks â€œat the same rumbling pitch of the rolling balls.â€A woman talks about rivers of blood if you ask her about cheese soufflÃ©s. Another compulsively takes in wild animals until one finally kills her. Yet another can remember being born. (â€œIt was dark inside Mama.â€) If someone showed up with an emotional support anteater, he or she would not seem out of place.In the manner of John Irving and Salman Rushdie and Annie Proulx in their less persuasive work, McCracken in â€œBowlawayâ€ comes close to writing caricatures instead of characters.That this ambitious novel nearly works is a testament to her considerable gifts as a novelist, her instinctive access to the most intricate threads of human thought and feeling.â€œBowlawayâ€ begins at the start of the 20th century, when a woman named Bertha Truitt turns up — inexplicably, as if she has beamed down from outer space — in the cemetery of a small town north of Boston.Bertha is larger than life in many ways. She's big and bosomy, which is worth remarking because so many of the people in this novel, men and women, have had too much cake and too little exercise. McCracken writes wonderfully and perceptively about large bodies. If she were a painter or sculptor, she'd be Fernando Botero or Henry Moore, not Modigliani or El Greco.Bertha, who is described as a â€œprophet of bowling,â€ opens a candlepin alley. The place is a success, in part because of its feminist bona fides. In most bowling alleys at the time, McCracken writes, women had to bowl behind curtains, separated from the men for modesty's sake. Not here.Women bowling in the open bring gawkers, â€œbecause where else could you see such a good-looking girl dewy with sweat and happiness, and not pay a cent, and not have to go to confession?â€This candlepin alley attracts ghosts. A major character spontaneously combusts. Another dies in the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, which is a correlative, at times, for the experience of reading â€œBowlaway.â€The alley attracts orphans and sensitive, damaged souls, the heartbroken and the disinherited. As this novel moves through the decades we follow them, as well as the children of Bertha and others. Some go to New York City. Others go to wars. Some open their own bowling alleys.The plot has many resonances but never fully sets its hooks in us. The politics of nearly all its characters, with respect to feminism, interracial marriage, and gay and lesbian tendencies, are anachronistically progressive.This novel's cast grows epic, but McCracken is always most impressive when she works small, when she is describing movie kisses or corsets or simply loneliness and longing.One man in â€œBowlawayâ€ likes drinking for the same reason I like her sentences: â€œBeer turned on the lights, warmed the furniture.â€"
"For various reasons — we're fighting colds, Times Square is stumbling through the usual post-holiday blahs, our colleagues in the Travel section just unveiled their latest sumptuous list of 52 places to visit — we've got globe-trotting on the mind this week. If you do too, might we recommend some short stories from Argentina? Or a new bayou murder mystery from James Lee Burke? A novel about Somali immigrants in Norway, or a collection of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's precise character studies of expats and emigrants? You'll find all of those below, along with Paul Collier's nonfiction book about retaining a sense of community in a globalized world. Closer to home, we offer a couple of food memoirs, and a natural history of the domestic biome that may have you urgently planning your next vacation to a technologically engineered cleanroom facility with a protective suit and a book. The cleanroom would be a mistake, our review makes clear. But a book is always a good idea.Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksMOUTHFUL OF BIRDS: Stories, by Samanta Schweblin. Translated by Megan McDowell. (Riverhead, $26.) This collection by the Argentine writer Samanta Schweblin, among the most acclaimed Spanish-language writers of her generation, has the surrealist echoes of her contemporaries Kelly Link and Jesse Ball. â€œBut, to me, her true ancestor could only be David Lynch; her tales are woven out of dread, doubles and confident loose ends,â€ our critic Parul Sehgal writes. â€œHer stories are obsessed with notions of purity and danger; with the ways people can be deformed, very early on, in the name of tenderness, teaching and care.â€THE NEW IBERIA BLUES, by James Lee Burke. (Simon & Schuster, $27.99.) In the latest Dave Robicheaux mystery, Burke's lawman hero contends with multiple visitors to his Louisiana bayou parish: a murderer fleeing prison; a Hollywood director returning to his roots for a movie; a woman nailed to a wooden cross that washes up from the bay. It's brutal and chaotic, but engrossing. â€œDoes anyone really read Burke expecting a coherent narrative? We're hanging on for Robicheaux's pensÃ©es,â€ Marilyn Stasio writes in her crime column. â€œWe're keeping an eye out for vivid characters. â€¦ Maybe most of all, we're waiting for those angry outbursts when Robicheaux lets it rip.â€NORTH OF DAWN, by Nuruddin Farah. (Riverhead, $27.) The war between the middle-aged Somali couple in Farah's new novel, set in middle-class Norway, is a proxy for the global clash between fundamentalism and secularism. â€œIn the hands of a younger, brasher novelist, we might expect high drama, but here, instead, is a nuanced, quietly devastating family soap opera,â€ our reviewer, Melanie Finn, writes. Farah â€œuses the intimate as allegory for the national. If we cannot understand why a family falls apart, then neither can we understand why a nation does — a truth those of us weary from holiday-dinner-table political arguments may appreciate.â€THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM: Facing the New Anxieties, by Paul Collier. (Harper/HarperCollins, $29.99.) Collier, who has devoted his career to the uplift of the global poor, argues that national loyalty is a firmer foundation for global justice than abstract cosmopolitanism, which too often masks unrestricted selfishness. â€œHow does Collier intend to repair the bonds of affection in the rich democracies? â€˜The Future of Capitalism' is rife with inventive proposals,â€ Reihan Salam writes in his review. â€œThough I wouldn't endorse Collier's manifesto in every detail, his â€˜hard centrism' has much to offer.â€AT THE END OF THE CENTURY: The Stories of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. (Counterpoint, $26.) A posthumous collection from the novelist and screenwriter best known for her precise accounts of individuals caught between different societies, seeking to find an elusive sense of home. â€œHer work anticipates a world of displaced people,â€ Megan O'Grady notes in her review, â€œwhere, as the half-British, half-Indian narrator of one of her stories puts it, everyone is â€˜moving more freely' as â€˜refugees or emigrants or just out of restless curiosity' and where there are â€˜at least two generations of people in whom several kinds of heritage are combined.' â€¦ The stories — all of them elegantly plotted and unsentimental, with an addictive, told-over-tea quality — are largely character studies of people isolated, often tragically, by custom or self-delusion.â€NEVER HOME ALONE: From Microbes to Millipedes, Camel Crickets, and Honeybees, the Natural History of Where We Live, by Rob Dunn. (Basic, $30.) Dunn has been involved in an obsessive quest to document the tiny inhabitants of indoor environments. News from the showerhead biome is just one part of this fact-filled, occasionally disgusting, slightly alarming book. â€œThere's a real sense of â€˜gee-whiz' in this book,â€ our reviewer, Robin Marantz Henig, writes, â€œbut it's mostly in service of Dunn's overarching goal: to preach the preservation of biodiversity, not only in the lush forests and streams that fit our traditional image of nature's abundance, but in the most humble places, too, where the vast majority of us will have most of our cross-species encounters — our basements, mattresses, refrigerator drawers and showerheads.â€THE BREAD AND THE KNIFE: A Life in 26 Bites, by Dawn Drzal. (Arcade, $19.99.) In this alphabet of autobiographical, gastronomical essays, Drzal traces the delicate emotions packed into a scene with the precision of a miniaturist. Irina Dumitrescu reviews the book alongside two other food memoirs. â€œWhile food provides the hooks for Drzal's memories, the collection thrums for other reasons,â€ Dumitrescu writes: â€œher moments of unflinching but forgiving self-criticism, descriptions of place that transport readers with a minimum of detail, and a knack for metaphors so perfect as to seem inevitable.â€KITCHEN YARNS: Notes on Life, Love, and Food, by Ann Hood. (Norton, $24.95.) A novelist offers meditations on food and life, served with the easy intimacy of a friend. â€œHood's essays are like hot chocolate, cozy and warm,â€ Irina Dumitrescu writes in her review. â€œHer collection of meditations on food and life touches the big themes: grief for a brother and a small child gone suddenly, two divorces and the end of a grand affair. â€¦ The recipes closing each chapter hint that every heartache can be soothed by the deft application of cheese and carbohydrates.â€"
"[For the latest updates on the Christchurch attack, read our Saturday live briefing.]â€¢ Forty-nine people were killed in shootings at two mosques in central Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a terrorist attack that appeared to have been carried out by a white nationalist extremist who posted a racist manifesto online and streamed live video of the attacks on Facebook.â€¢ After visiting victims and their families Saturday afternoon, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said many of the people who died in the attacks were the breadwinners in their families, and that the government would help those who had been left without income.â€¢ A 28-year-old man from Australia was charged with murder and appeared Saturday morning in a Christchurch courtroom. Court papers identified him as Brenton Harrison Tarrant. The New Zealand police said he would face additional charges. A second man, 18, was charged with â€œintent to excite hostility or ill-will.â€â€¢ Though officials have not released the names of those killed, a list of those missing has been published by the New Zealand Red Cross on its website. It includes people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Jordan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[How to help the victims of the Christchurch shootings.]The attacker targeted the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city and Linwood Mosque, about three miles away.The country's police commissioner, Mike Bush, said at a Friday evening news conference that 41 people had been killed at Al Noor Mosque and seven at Linwood Mosque, and that another victim had died at Christchurch Hospital.David Meates, the chief executive of the Canterbury District Health Board, said that 48 people, including young children, were treated for injuries at the hospital. Mr. Bush said Saturday morning that two of the victims were in critical condition.The police said Friday that three men and one woman had been taken into custody, but Mr. Bush lowered the total number to three on Saturday morning, indicating that someone had been released.Ms. Ardern said none of those detained had been on security watch lists.Mr. Bush had earlier urged people not to go to mosques anywhere in New Zealand on Friday. He also urged mosques nationally to â€œclose your doors until you hear from us again.â€In a Christchurch courtroom hearing closed to the public for security reasons, police officers in bulletproof vests brought in the suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant. The police said he had been charged with one count of murder but would face additional charges. Mr. Tarrant, 28, short with thinning brown hair, handcuffed and wearing white prison clothing, looked around the courtroom but said nothing as District Court Judge Paul Kellar ordered him held for a further hearing on April 5.Regional officials have said Mr. Tarrant is an Australian citizen. Court papers listed his New Zealand address as Dunedin City, which is about 280 miles south of Christchurch.Richard Peters, his court-appointed lawyer, said Mr. Tarrant had indicated he might represent himself in the prosecution. Asked how Mr. Tarrant had reacted to what he is facing, Mr. Peters said, â€œHe seemed to be quite aware of where he is and what he's doing.â€At the same time the charging document for Mr. Tarrant was handed out to reporters, a second court filing was distributed that said Daniel John Burrough, 18, of Christchurch, had been charged with â€œintent to excite hostility or ill-will.â€ Court officials would not elaborate on how the two cases were related.In addition to Mr. Tarrant, three other people were arrested in connection with the attacks, although one was apparently released. Few details have been offered about them.Families are mourning loved ones, and the city of Christchurch is preparing to bury its dead. As news trickles out about the victims of the massacre, their nationalities are beginning to emerge.Though officials have not released the names of those killed, a list of those missing has been published by the New Zealand Red Cross on its website. It includes people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Jordan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.At least three people from Bangladesh were killed, and another two from Jordan, according to local news reports. Five people from Pakistan are missing, and several others were injured, officials in Pakistan confirmed. Other foreign ministries around the world said their citizens were caught up in the attack, including three people from Turkey.A 17-minute video posted to Facebook shows part of the attack.The clip, which appeared to have been taken from a helmet camera worn by the gunman, begins behind the wheel of a car. A man, whose face can occasionally be seen in the rearview mirror, drives through the streets of Christchurch before pulling up in front of Al Noor Mosque, beside the sprawling Hagley Park.[Read more here about the video, manifesto and social media posts.]He approaches the mosque on foot, his weapon visible, and begins shooting at people at the entrance. What follows is a harrowing nearly two minutes of his firing on worshipers.At one point the gunman exits the mosque and fires in both directions down the sidewalk before returning to his car for another gun — which, like the others, was inscribed with numbers, symbols or messages. When he re-enters the mosque, he shoots several bodies at close range.After another few minutes, he returns to his vehicle and drives away.â€œThere wasn't even time to aim, there was so many targets,â€ he says at one point, as the sirens of an emergency response vehicle blare in the background.Before the shooting, the gunman posted links to a white nationalist manifesto on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for extremist right-wing discussions. The 8chan post included a link to the gunman's Facebook page, where he said he would also broadcast live video of the attack.The Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.In his manifesto, he identified himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia, and listed his white nationalist heroes.Writing that he had purposely used guns to stir discord in the United States over the Second Amendment's provision on the right to bear arms, he also declared himself a fascist. â€œFor once, the person that will be called a fascist, is an actual fascist,â€ he wrote.Many of the people who died in the attacks were the breadwinners in their family, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Saturday.The victims were â€œpredominantly from the ages of 20 to 60ish — and a large number of men,â€ Ms. Ardern told reporters at Hagley College, a local school near the hospital where relatives of the victims were gathering.She said a government compensation system would help families of those left without income. In the meantime, mosques would continue to get extra security, she added.â€œThe commissioner has advised that police security will continue at mosques around New Zealand until it is determined that it is no longer a threat,â€ she said, referring to the country's police commissioner, Mike Bush.Earlier in the day, Ms. Ardern vowed changes to the country's gun laws. She said that the attacker held a gun license obtained last November and that five guns were used in the attack, including two semi-automatic weapons.â€œOur gun laws will change, now is the time,â€ Ms. Ardern said, though did not elaborate on what such legislation may look like. â€œPeople will be seeking change, and I am committed to that.â€President Trump, who was mentioned in the suspected assailant's manifesto as a source of inspiration, rejected suggestions that white nationalism is a rising menace, although he suggested it might be problem in New Zealand.â€œI think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,â€ he told reporters in Washington in response to a question. â€œIf you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet. But it's certainly a terrible thing.â€Asked if he had seen the manifesto, Mr. Trump said: â€œI did not see it, but I think it's a horrible event, it's a horrible thing. I saw it early in the morning when I looked at what was happening, and we spoke, as you know, to the prime minister. I think it's a horrible disgraceful thing, horrible act.â€Attacks on mosques and Muslim religious leaders in the West have increased in recent years, according to data from the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland. North America, Europe and Oceania saw 128 such attacks from 2010 through 2017, the latest year of available data.Terrorist attacks on other religious institutions, such as churches and synagogues, totaled 213 over the same period.Felix Kjellberg, a polarizing YouTube celebrity known as PewDiePie, distanced himself from the attacks after the man who filmed himself shooting victims at a mosque encouraged viewers to â€œsubscribe to PewDiePieâ€ in a video livestream.â€œI feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person,â€ Mr. Kjellberg, a Swede, said on Twitter.Mr. Kjellberg has courted controversy by performing anti-Semitic gestures, which he calls satirical, in his videos. He has a following of 89 million subscribers.Over the last 18 months, tech companies have promised stronger safeguards to ensure that violent content is not distributed through their sites. But those new safeguards were not enough to stop the posting of a video and manifesto believed related to Friday's shooting.A 17-minute video that included graphic footage apparently of the shooting could be found on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram more than an hour after being posted. While Facebook and Twitter took down pages thought to be linked to the gunman, the posted content was spread rapidly through other accounts.In order to evade detection, people appeared to be cropping the video or posting the text of the manifesto as an image — techniques used to evade automated systems that find and delete content.Social media companies have heavily invested in those systems, with Facebook reporting last year that more than 99 percent of terrorism content by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda was found and removed through artificial intelligence.A Facebook spokeswoman offered condolences to the victims and said the company was â€œremoving any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware.â€YouTube said it had taken down thousands of videos related to the shooting, and asked users to help flag videos. A spokeswoman for Reddit said it was also trying to remove â€œany content containing links to the video stream or the manifesto.â€Still, the tech companies were sharply criticized by Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic candidate for president, who said in New Hampshire on Friday that it was â€œunacceptableâ€ for the companies to give â€œa platform to hate.â€Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, said the country's Muslims were anxious for updates.[For Muslims in New Zealand and abroad, the massacre has drawn outrage as a brazen act of hatred borne of anti-Muslim sentiment.]Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from the rest of New Zealand's Muslims to arrange 49 funerals.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said that three Turkish citizens were wounded in the attack; the Palestine Liberation Organization's ambassador to New Zealand said at least one Palestinian was killed; and the group Syrian Solidarity New Zealand said on its Facebook page that â€œSyrian refugees, including children, have been shot today.â€A site managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross listed dozens of people who had been recorded as missing, including people from Egypt, Syria, India, Kuwait, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia.Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, urged all Muslims to attend Friday Prayers and exhorted people of all faiths to join them to repudiate the white supremacist message of the New Zealand attack.â€œI know there was a call for people to not go,â€ she told reporters after addressing a climate rally in Washington. â€œBut I said to people that is what the terrorists want us to do. That is a win for them, and so we must face the hate and terror with love and with compassion.â€Ms. Omar also said â€œeveryone should join us in solidarity.â€The New Zealand police force had called for mosques in the country to close.The congresswoman, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, has been at the center of a political tempest in the Democratic Party over remarks on Israel that critics have called anti-Semitic. She has apologized for those remarks.Members of the Bangladesh national cricket team, in Christchurch for a match against New Zealand, were en route to Al Noor Mosque for Friday Prayer when the shooting began. They narrowly missed it.Mohammad Isam, a journalist covering the team, reported for ESPN that at 1:52 p.m. he got a call from Tamim Iqbal Khan, one of the players.â€œThere's shooting here, please save us,â€ Mr. Khan said, according to Mr. Isam. At first, he thought it was a prank.â€œBut he hangs up and calls again — this time, his voice starts to crack,â€ Mr. Isam wrote. â€œHe says that I should call the police as there's a shooting going on inside the mosque where they are about to enter.â€Mr. Isam ran toward the mosque and saw bloodied and dazed people fleeing. In the chaos, he managed to find several players, and they eventually reconvened at the hotel. The team manager, Khaled Mashud, told reporters that players were about 50 yards from the mosque.â€œHad we reached even three or four minutes earlier, we probably would have been inside the mosque,â€ he said.â€œEntire team got saved from active shooters,â€ Mr. Khan wrote on Twitter. Another player, Mushfiqur Rahim, tweeted that he never wanted â€œto see this things happen again.â€Aman Singh, who works at a convenience store close to the Deans Avenue mosque, said he had heard the gunshots on Friday afternoon, and that shortly afterward people streamed past the shop, bloody and crying.Mr. Singh, 26, said he knew several people who worshiped at the mosque.â€œMy really good friend goes there,â€ he said, adding that he had not been able to confirm the friend's whereabouts on Friday afternoon.Murders are rare in New Zealand, and gun homicides even rarer. There were 35 murders countrywide in 2017. And since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits each year except 2009, when there were 11.But there are plenty of guns.There were 1.2 million registered firearms in the country of 4.6 million people in 2017, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit.New Zealand law allows any person aged 16 or older with an entry-level firearm license to keep any number of common rifles and shotguns, according to GunPolicy.org, a project hosted by the University of Sydney. Most guns can be purchased without being tracked by law enforcement officials.A mass shooting in Aramoana, New Zealand, in 1990 — when a man killed 13 people, including two 6-year-olds, after a dispute with his neighbor — led directly to tightened gun laws, including restrictions on â€œmilitary-style semiautomatic weapons.â€"
"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — At least 49 people were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a horrific and methodical afternoon slaughter, part of which was broadcast live on the internet after the publication of a white supremacist manifesto online.The massacre, which Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, condemned as a terrorist attack and called â€œan extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,â€ interrupted a day of prayer for a small immigrant community in the nation's third-largest city and shook a country with little history of mass shooting.Harrowing first-person footage, apparently from a camera worn by a gunman as he attacked the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city, was streamed on Facebook — a grim milestone in the evolution of terrorism that raised questions about how tech companies can block extremists from using social media to spread hate and inspire violence.[Follow our live briefing here.]Facebook said it quickly shut down the account, but a 17-minute video showing a man dressed in black shooting at fleeing worshipers and into piles of bodies with a semiautomatic rifle circulated widely online. In addition to those killed, at least 48 people were being treated for gunshot wounds, including young children, the authorities said.The police said a man in his late 20s was arrested and charged with murder but declined to identify him. The police also said they seized several weapons and found two explosive devices on a vehicle.â€œThis is and will be one of New Zealand's darkest days,â€ Ms. Ardern said at a news conference.Schools in the downtown area were locked down for hours after the attacks as the police tried to determine whether the gunman acted alone. The authorities urged residents to stay indoors, asked mosques to close and cleared nearby Cathedral Square, where people had gathered as part of worldwide protests to demand action on climate change.New Zealand's police commissioner, Mike Bush, said three other individuals found near the scene with weapons were also taken into custody, though investigators later said that one probably had nothing to do with the attacks.The shootings were first reported at about 1:40 p.m., around the time of the midday Friday prayer, when the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Mosque, about three miles east, would be most busy. The manifesto had appeared online minutes earlier.The document named both mosques, and links to it were posted on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for hosting message boards with extremist right-wing discussions. The 8chan post included a link to what appeared to be the gunman's Facebook page, where he said he would soon broadcast live video of the attack.But it was not immediately clear whether the name on the page was that of the suspect, and the authorities declined to comment.Ms. Ardern said that many of the victims were most likely migrants to New Zealand or refugees.â€œChristchurch was the home of these victims,â€ she said. â€œFor many this may not have been the place they were born. For many, New Zealand was their choice, the place that they chose to come to and committed themselves to, the place they chose to raise their families.â€She added that New Zealand was likely targeted â€œbecause we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, refuge for those who need it.â€Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, said people were anxious for updates and were worried that friends or family members were among the dead.â€œNobody's answering their phones,â€ she said. â€œWe don't know if they're at the hospital or out of reach. Some have posted that they are safe, but others have not.â€Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from Muslims across the country to arrange the 49 funerals they would need to plan.Historians say Muslims have lived in New Zealand for more than 150 years, but the population has grown with immigration from war-torn countries like Iraq and Afghanistan in the 1990s and 2000s. In a country of nearly five million people, though, only about 46,000 identified as Muslim in the 2013 census.The video of the attack, which appeared to be recorded on a helmet camera, showed the gunman driving to the mosque and then opening fire even before he entered the building. For nearly two minutes, he shoots at fleeing worshipers before he runs back to his car and swaps weapons.He then is seen re-entering the mosque and opening fire again, methodically moving from room to room and shooting into piles of bodies slumped on the green carpets. Several victims can be seen in the footage, many lying on top of one another motionless in a corner of the room.After another few minutes, the gunman leaves again, gets in his vehicle and drives away, pausing occasionally to fire at pedestrians while talking to himself throughout.â€œThere wasn't even time to aim, there was so many targets,â€ he says at one point.The police in New Zealand said they were working to remove the video from the internet and urged people not to share it.Facebook said it was alerted by the police shortly after the livestream started. â€œWe quickly removed both the shooter's Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,â€ Mia Garlick, a Facebook representative, said in a statement. â€œWe're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we're aware.â€Before the shooting began, the gunman made a winking reference to an internet meme, telling viewers to â€œsubscribe to PewDiePie,â€ a reference to the Swedish YouTube star Felix Kjellberg. Mr. Kjellberg, who has been criticized for anti-Semitism over skits that he called satirical, said on Twitter that he felt â€œabsolutely sickenedâ€ that the gunman had mentioned him.The video and Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.The author of the manifesto identifies himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia. He listed his white nationalist heroes, described his animosity toward Muslims and immigrants, and said he chose to use guns in the attacks to stir discord in the United States around the Second Amendment.Aman Singh, 26, who works at a convenience store close to the Al Noor Mosque, said he hid after hearing gunshots and seeing people stream past, bloody and crying.â€œMy really good friend goes there,â€ he said, adding that he had not been able to confirm the friend's whereabouts.Mohammad Isam, a Bangladeshi journalist, posted a video of members of Bangladesh's national cricket team who he said escaped the attack.Christchurch, with about 388,000 residents, is the biggest city on New Zealand's South Island, hugging the Pacific Ocean coast.There hasn't been a mass shooting in New Zealand since 1990, when a man killed 13 people, including two 6-year-olds, after a dispute with his neighbor in the seaside town of Aramoana.That shooting led to tightened gun laws, including restrictions on â€œmilitary style semiautomatic weapons.â€Gun owners must be licensed, a process that includes a review of criminal activity and mental health, attendance at a safety program, an explanation of how the gun would be used, a residence visit to ensure secure storage, and testimonials from relatives and friends.Murders are rare in New Zealand, and gun homicides even rarer. There were 35 murders countrywide in 2017. Since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits each year except 2009, when there were 11.But there are plenty of guns. There were 1.2 million registered firearms in a country of 4.6 million people in 2017, according to the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss nonprofit."
"Sam Shepard's wild West just got a lot scarier.I'm talking about that shadowy, shifting desertscape occupied so disharmoniously by the two brothers of Shepard's 1980 masterwork, â€œTrue West,â€ which has been given a ripping revival by James Macdonald at the American Airlines Theater. As embodied by a brilliant Ethan Hawke, in full-menace mode, and a tightly wired Paul Dano, everyday sibling rivalry has seldom felt this ominous.[Read more about Paul Dano, and his reflections on acting and directing.]It's not that you worry that one's going to kill the other, in the time-honored tradition of Cain and Abel, although that looms as a possibility. What's really threatening in this Roundabout Theater Company production, which opened on Thursday night, is its creeping, gut-knotting insistence that family is no fortress against a darkness that erases all sense of a separate self.On the contrary. When it comes to getting lost in the gloaming of existential nothingness, there's no place like home.Anyone who knows the work of Shepard, who died in 2017, will be familiar with this discomfiting perspective. â€œA Lie of the Mind,â€ the name of his 1985 portrait of a family in fission, could well be an umbrella title for the series of domestic dramas that preceded it, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning â€œBuried Childâ€ (1978). (Footnote: Mr. Hawke has Shepard cred, having appeared in the 1995 Steppenwolf revival of â€œBuried Childâ€ in Chicago and directed a first-rate â€œLie of the Mindâ€ in New York in 2010.)Written during a decade-long explosion of creativity, these plays present a tragicomic vision of the American family that, for my money, puts him in the exalted company of Eugene O'Neill. â€œTrue Westâ€ — first seen in New York in a misbegotten, miscast production at the Public Theater nearly four decades ago — hasn't always received the solemn respect accorded the others.It is usually thought of as an occasion for Method men — including John Malkovich and Gary Sinise (in 1982) and Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly (who memorably switched roles in rotation in 2000) — to get down and dirty and tear up the scenery. Mr. Hawke and Mr. Dano do all that, especially in the boisterous second act.But Mr. Macdonald — a British director who has expertly interpreted the apocalyptic visions of Caryl Churchill (â€œEscaped Aloneâ€ and â€œA Number,â€ which happened to star Shepard) — is a master at building suspense from seemingly banal elements. And for the first half of his â€œTrue West,â€ he imbues the most prosaic details with mounting tension worthy of Hitchcock.[What's new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter.]Here's the setup: Austin (Mr. Dano), a screenwriter in his early 30s, is taking time away from his family to work at the Southern California home of his mother, who is vacationing in Alaska. (She shows up late in the play, in the pricelessly bewildered form of Marylouise Burke.) To his politely concealed dismay, he is joined by a surprise guest: big brother Lee (Mr. Hawke), a scruffy black sheep whom Austin hasn't seen in five years.As rendered in Mimi Lien's set, Mom's place (in full view of the audience before the show begins) is a sunny slice of California cheesiness, with a garden gnome, flourishing potted plants and a clear view of the house next door. Nothing to be scared of here.Then the play proper starts, in thick darkness, with the repeated crash of guitar chords and a blitz of bright lights that define the proscenium frame, an effect repeated between the succeeding scenes. Gradually, two figures emerge. (Jane Cox did the superb, insinuating lighting.) One of them is Austin, crisply pressed, bespectacled, seated at a typewriter.Then there's the bulky, tall guy by the sink. He looks like trouble — maybe a burglar who would happily pull a knife on you if cornered. To say that he is Austin's brother does not contradict this impression. In Mr. Shepard's universe, home invader and next of kin can easily be one in the same.Accept the satisfying shivers the moment provokes, sit back and get ready to enjoy the most perfectly distilled 50 minutes or so of classic Shepard you're ever likely to see. What happens in the play's first act is, on one level, routine family friction, with the attendant laundry list of grievances about who got the better deal growing up.But the uneasiness inherent in such encounters acquires a shimmering intensity, as in a nightmare that's both set in a place you know and as alien as a distant planet. The two boys are obviously falling back into old patterns of taunting, resentful aggression (Lee) and tightly wound propitiation (Austin).Yet no matter the subject — a dinner plate with a map of Idaho, the screenplay Austin's working on, their alcohol-demented old father or the months alone Lee spent in the Mojave Desert — it somehow feels as if the stakes couldn't be higher. Not because Lee might be planning to loot the neighbors' houses or bollix Austin's deal with his producer (played with a Teflon shield of casualness by Gary Wilmes).No, what's really at stake is their very identities, as Austin and Lee become increasingly exaggerated versions of their scrapping, younger selves. It's a process rendered by Mr. Hawke and Mr. Dano with devastatingly defensive body language.A moment when Lee playfully, nastily dangles the car keys he's taken from Austin feels potentially lethal. And all the while a blanket of nerve-twanging noise — chirping crickets, yipping coyotes, even children at play — seems not to connect but to isolate the brothers from the rest of the world. (Bray Poor's sound design is inspired.)The end of the first act left me breathless. The second act — the celebrated, hilarious, tearing-down-the-house part — felt slightly off its rhythms at the preview performance I saw. It's not that the evermore violent, frenzied and deliciously absurd action (I love the slew of stolen toasters) isn't impeccably staged. But Mr. Dano was nailing the moves without making that final, essential leap into the void, and the tension sagged. I suspect he'll get there as the play's run continues.Mr. Hawke is already delivering a faultless performance, probably his best ever onstage and a worthy bookend to his Oscar-deserving turn as a faith-challenged priest in Paul Schrader's recent film â€œFirst Reformed.â€ His slovenly, combustible Lee is revealed to be as terrified as he is terrifying, in ways you can't help identifying with.Lee, by the way, has his own idea for a movie, a western. It's a story of men chasing each other across a desert, in the dark.â€œThey don't know each one of 'em is afraid, see,â€ Lee says in a hypnotic monologue. â€œEach one separately thinks he's the only one that's afraid. And they keep riding like that straight into the night.â€ That's a perfect prÃ©cis of â€œTrue West,â€ a play that seems to grow in disturbing depth every time it comes back to haunt us."
"National identity is the most powerful force in world politics today. Most of the strong leaders around the world were swept to power with a strong nationalist story and govern in nationalist ways. This is true in Russia, China, India, the U.S., Israel, Turkey, Britain, Brazil and on and on. It's hard to see how any party could appeal or govern these days without a strong national story.In this country, Donald Trump has almost nothing but a national story, which he returned to with a vengeance in the closing days of this year's campaigns. It happens to be a cramped, reactionary and racial story. Trump effectively defines America as a white ethnic nation that is being overrun by aliens — people who don't look like us, don't share our values, who threaten our safety and take our jobs.Trump's blood-and-soil nationalism overturns the historical ideal of American nationalism, which was pluralistic — that we are united by creed, not blood; that our common culture is defined by a shared American dream — pioneers settling the West, immigrants crossing an ocean in search of opportunity, African-Americans rising from slavery toward equality.The Republicans have flocked to Trump's cramped nationalism and abandoned their creedal story. That's left the Democrats with a remarkable opportunity. They could seize the traditional American national story, or expand it to gather in the unheard voices, while providing a coherent, unifying vehicle to celebrate the American dream.And yet what have we heard from the Democrats? Crickets.What is the Democratic national story? A void.Why have the Democrats failed to offer a counternarrative to Trumpian nationalism? For two reasons, I think, one political and one moral.First, these days nations often define their national identities through their immigration policies. Democrats have never liked to talk about immigration at election time. The immigration issue splits the Democratic coalition. Affluent progressive and liberal activists are for it, but working-class whites and African-Americans are more skeptical.Moreover, those going to the polls in recent years who name immigration as their top issue tend to be much more restrictionist. If you're a Democrat, you don't get credit for being pro-immigrant from your friends, but you do get punished by your foes. So this year, as in past years, Democrats have tried to change the subject. In September, for example, 50 percent of the congressional pro-Democratic ads referred to health care. Only 4 percent mentioned immigration.Second, over the last several years, Democrats have begun to think about nationalism and immigration differently. In the past, Democrats tended to see immigration as an economic issue. Most mainstream Democrats have always been pro-immigrant, but they also favored border enforcement as a way to protect working-class wages. Barack Obama deported more unauthorized immigrants in his first two years in office than Trump has so far. Bernie Sanders used to dismiss open borders as a â€œKoch brothers proposal.â€But now, especially in the wake of Trumpian nativism, immigration is seen as a racial justice issue. Calls for law and order on the border are taken as code for racism. The phrase â€œillegal immigrantâ€ has been struck from the Democratic lexicon. Anything that is pro-immigrant is seen as enlightened, and anything that restricts immigration is regarded as morally suspect. This framing unwittingly cuts the legs out from any position that falls short of open borders.Politically, Democrats have wound up in a place where they decry the policies that restrict undocumented immigration, but they don't really have any other policies to replace them. Progressives are for abolishing ICE and our current asylum-detention procedures, but what would they put in their stead?After 30 years of multiculturalism, the bonds of racial solidarity trump the bonds of national solidarity. Democrats have a very strong story to tell about what we owe the victims of racism and oppression. They do not have a strong story to tell about what we owe to other Americans, how we define our national borders and what binds us as Americans.Here's the central challenge of our age: Over the next few decades, America will become a majority-minority country. It is hard to think of other major nations, down through history, that have managed such a transition and still held together.It seems that the Democratic Party is going to lead us through this transition. The Republicans have decided to pretend it's not happening. Trump had a chance to build a pan-ethnic nationalist coalition but went with white identity politics instead. Republicans have rendered themselves irrelevant to the great generational challenge before us.But if the Democrats are going to lead this transition, they'll need not just a mind-set that celebrates diversity, but also a mind-set that creates unity. They'll need policies that integrate different groups into a coherent nation, with shared projects, a common language and culture and clear borders.If you don't offer people a positive, uplifting nationalism, they will grab the nasty one. History and recent events have shown us that."
"NEW DELHI — It was an inauspicious moment for a military the United States is banking on to help keep an expanding China in check.An Indian Air Force pilot found himself in a dogfight last week with a warplane from the Pakistani Air Force, and ended up a prisoner behind enemy lines for a brief time.The pilot made it home in one piece, however bruised and shaken, but the plane, an aging Soviet-era MiG-21, was less lucky.[Read about how tensions have affected an American cricket team with players from both countries.] The aerial clash, the first by the South Asian rivals in nearly five decades, was a rare test for the Indian military — and it left observers a bit dumbfounded. While the challenges faced by the India's armed forces are no secret, its loss of a plane last week to a country whose military is about half the size and receives a quarter of the funding was still telling.India's armed forces are in alarming shape.If intense warfare broke out tomorrow, India could supply its troops with only 10 days of ammunition, according to government estimates. And 68 percent of the army's equipment is so old, it is officially considered â€œvintage.â€â€œOur troops lack modern equipment, but they have to conduct 21st-century military operations,â€ said Gaurav Gogoi, a lawmaker and member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense.American officials tasked with strengthening the alliance talk about their mission with frustration: a swollen bureaucracy makes arms sales and joint training exercises cumbersome; Indian forces are vastly underfunded; and the country's navy, army and air force tend to compete rather than work together.Whatever the problems, the United States is determined to make the country a key ally in the coming years to hedge against China's growing regional ambition.Last year, when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced that the Pentagon was renaming its Pacific Command — to Indo-Pacific — he emphasized India's importance in a shifting world order.â€œIt is our primary combatant command,â€ said Mr. Mattis, who left the Pentagon at the end of the year. â€œIt's standing watch and intimately engaged with over half of the earth's surface and its diverse populations, from Hollywood to Bollywood.â€The American military began prioritizing its alliance with India as its close relationship with Pakistan soured over the last two decades. United States officials are concerned that Pakistan is not doing enough to fight terrorism, a charge the country denies.In just a decade, United States arms sales to India have gone from nearly zero to $15 billion. But Pakistan can still draw on a powerful American-supplied arsenal.[To follow the growing hostilities between India and Pakistan, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]Indian officials say Pakistan used one of its F-16 fighter jets to down its MiG-21 last week. Islamabad rejected the claim, but on Sunday the American Embassy in Islamabad said the United States was looking into the report. The offensive use of an F-16 warplane against its neighbor might have been a violation of the sales agreement.â€œWe are aware of these reports and are seeking more information,â€ the embassy said in a statement. â€œWe take all allegations of misuse of defense articles very seriously.â€However troubled its military, India holds an obvious strategic appeal to the United States by virtue of both its location and its size.India will soon become the world's most populous country, on track to surpass China by 2024. It shares a long border with southern and western China and controls important territorial waters Beijing needs for its maritime trade routes.All that can help the United States try to box in its rival.â€œIndia's sheer demographics, its long-term military potential, its geographic expanse — it makes India worth waiting for,â€ said Jeff Smith, a research fellow for South Asia at the Heritage Foundation in Washington and the author of â€œCold Peace: China-India Rivalry in the 21st Century.â€â€œAs China rises and the United States fights to keep its dominance, it will need a swing state to tip the balance of power in the 21st century,â€ Mr. Smith said. â€œAnd that swing state is India. The United States knows this and is willing to be patient.â€For India's military, funding remains the biggest challenge.In 2018, India announced a military budget of some $45 billion. By comparison, China's military budget that year was $175 billion. Last month, Delhi announced another $45 billion budget.It is not just a question of how much India spends on its military, but how it spends it.The majority of the money goes to salaries for its 1.2 million active duty troops, as well as pensions. Only $14 billion will be used to buy new hardware.â€œAt a time when modern armies are investing hugely on upgrading their intelligence and technical capabilities, we need to be doing the same,â€ said Mr. Gogoi, the Parliament member.Unlike China, where an authoritarian government is free to set military policy as it wishes, India is a democracy, with all the messiness that can entail.Cutting troop levels so that the military can spend the money on buying modern equipment is not so simple. India's military has long been a source of jobs for a country struggling with chronic underemployment. That is likely to be a big issue in elections scheduled for later this spring.Prime Minister Narendra Modi won elections in 2014 promising to reform the economy and provide the one million jobs needed each month to satisfy its growing work force. But with elections around the corner, Mr. Modi has shelved promises of economic reform and embraced the usual populist measures.â€œThe thrust of this government is to focus more on economic development, which has to precede military strength,â€ said Amit Cowshish, a former defense ministry financial adviser for military acquisitions. â€œThat was what China did — they focused on developing their economy and then focused on acquiring their current military stature. The difference is that China started 20 or 30 years ahead of us in terms of economic liberalization.â€Government officials in New Delhi say they are struggling to improve the lives of their citizens in the most basic of ways — dealing with high illiteracy rates and poor sanitation infrastructure, as just two examples — making it hard to funnel more money toward the military at a time when China is making incursions into India's backyard by land and sea.China has significantly outpaced its rival, creating a robust and taxable middle class. China's economic boom has allowed it to invest aggressively in buying top military hardware and producing it at home.As the world's conflicts are increasingly fought with state-of-the-art weaponry rather than the large invading armies of the past, India is falling behind. Despite being the fifth-largest military spender, only about a quarter of its military budget this year will purchase new equipment.Although the purchase of military hardware is a slow-moving process in most countries, in India it moves even more sluggishly amid a swollen bureaucracy.There are also concerns about corruption.Mr. Modi is currently being grilled by the opposition over a murky $8.9 billion deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter planes from France. His political opponents have cast the agreement as corrupt in an effort to discredit him ahead of elections.The purchase will help India replace its aging fleet of MiG-21s and other jets. And on Saturday, the prime minister tried to turn the tables on the opposition, saying India  would have fared better in its skirmish with Pakistan last week if it had had the Rafale jets.â€œThe country has felt the shortage of Rafale,â€ Mr. Modi said."
"Once perceived as health-conscious people by some, and very, very picky eaters by others, vegans are trending.The Economist declared 2019 as the year of the vegan, reporting that a quarter of millennials identify as vegan or vegetarian. Outspoken celebrities like BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z are encouraging fans to become vegan, if not for ethical reasons, then because of health and environmental benefits. In a 2018 report, the vegan food industry recorded 20 percent growth over the previous year, with sales peaking at $3.3 billion.This demand for all things vegan has made other industries take notice, especially beauty.â€œBeauty follows food because we use a lot of the same ingredients,â€ said Tata Harper, the founder of a namesake natural beauty brand that's predominantly vegan. â€œIf they're good to ingest, then they're typically great to apply topically.â€Sunny Subramanian has been waiting for this moment since she introduced her Vegan Beauty Review site in 2007. An animal lover in Portland, Ore., Ms. Subramanian made the decision to go vegan 19 years ago. She cut meat, dairy and eggs from her diet; she stopped wearing leather, silk and wool. But with beauty, she was confronted with a problem: She couldn't find any information online about vegan beauty brands. So she did something about it.â€œWhen I first started, it was crickets — I was the only vegan beauty blog,â€ Ms. Subramanian said. â€œBack in the day, we made up such a teeny-tiny percentage of the population.â€There's a lot of confusing jargon around vegan beauty — â€œcruelty-freeâ€ is one example, with many people assuming that they're one and the same.Plain and simple, vegan beauty means the absence of animal ingredients, while cruelty-free refers to a product that doesn't test on animals. In other words, it's possible for a vegan item to have been tested on an animal and a cruelty-free product to contain animal ingredients.Adding to the confusion is the lack of Food and Drug Administration guidelines. A handful of organizations have rolled out insignia to signal whether a product is vegan or cruelty-free, the most distinguished being the Leaping Bunny Program, which grants certification to personal care and household product companies that ensure that no animal testing is done at any phase of the production process.â€œA finished product could say it's cruelty-free, but that's not good enough,â€ said Dennis Gross, a dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon whose skin-care line is certified by the Leaping Bunny Program. â€œMost animal testing occurs on the ingredient level, so with the Leaping Bunny Program, you're 100 percent certain that no animal testing occurs in the laboratory.â€ PETA's Beauty Without Bunnies Program lists every registered company that is either cruelty-free or both vegan and cruelty-free, and has corresponding logos to match. In Britain, the Vegan Society charity, the oldest vegan society in the world, has registered thousands of brands that are both vegan and cruelty-free.â€œIt's easy to pick a food item and decide if it's vegan or not, but it's more difficult with beauty,â€ said Dominika Piasecka, the media and public relations officer of the Vegan Society. â€œThere's a huge need for it to be labeled.â€Common animal-derived ingredients found in beauty products include honey, beeswax, lanolin (wool grease), squalene (shark liver oil), carmine (crushed-up beetles), gelatin (cow or pig bones, tendons or ligaments), allantoin (cow urine), ambergris (whale vomit) and placenta (sheep organs). While they're harmless, they're not better for you, either, though the thought of smearing on the animal parts found in moisturizers, cosmetics and shampoos may be a deterrent.â€œAnimal ingredients haven't been proven to be superior in any way, and wholesome vegan alternatives do exist,â€ Dr. Gross said.But the term â€œvegan beauty,â€ which is synonymous with â€œplant-based,â€ can be misleading, too. It conjures up images of virtuous greens and, in turn, healthiness, which is not necessarily the case.â€œChips are accidentally vegan, but they're not healthy,â€ Ms. Subramanian said. â€œIt's the same with makeup. Just because it's vegan and cruelty-free doesn't make it healthy. â€œIts ingredient list can be chock-full of unhealthy chemicals and fillers.â€The next step is to clean up the ingredient list without completely stripping away preservatives, which, Dr. Gross points out, can help maintain a product's freshness. â€œUsing only ingredients that are natural, you'll often see separation and bacteria growth, which can lead to contamination and loss of efficacy,â€ he said. â€œWith vegan beauty, you can use a pure nature-derived ingredient along with important additives to prevent them from spoiling. It's in the right combination.â€And there are plenty of brands — high-end and affordable — that are already doing just that, including Pacifica, Derma E and Le Labo, to name a few.â€œVegan products don't have to be super-expensive and hard to find,â€ Ms. Subramanian said, naming Wet n Wild and e.l.f. as budget-friendly vegan options. In the 30 years that Kathy Guillermo, a senior vice president of PETA, has campaigned to end the use of animals in laboratory experiments, she can pinpoint two industrywide shifts that spurred vegan awareness in beauty. The first was in 1990, when EstÃ©e Lauder and Revlon stopped testing on animals. Unfortunately, the very same companies began to sell in China, where animal testing is required on many beauty products. It caused backlash and consumer demand for cruelty-free products, which eventually led to the development of instrumentation to replace animal testing. The second is occurring now. In October, Unilever, the parent company of Dove, Axe, Dermalogica and many more, announced that it has committed to a policy of no animal testing across all of its product lines. â€œThe big companies that held out for so long are now making a change,â€ Ms. Guillermo said. For many brands, she said, concern about the ethical and environmental impact of their products is the No. 1 consumer question they encounter.â€œI think consumers, especially millennials and Gen Zs, are looking to make purchases that are in line with their personal values,â€ said Dr. Gross, whose patients regularly ask about vegan and cruelty-free products. â€œIt's driving a big change in the industry.â€Nine years ago, Dr. Gross converted his skin-care line to be cruelty-free and vegan, and it took three years to reformulate his offerings. (Now only two products in his 52-item lineup have animal-derived ingredients — pearl powder and beeswax — and those will be switched once he has found alternatives.)â€œIt's a more involved process to be vegan and cruelty-free because it's cheaper and easier to do animal testing,â€ he said. â€œClinical testing can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But since we made the switch, we've been able to produce products that don't compromise their effectiveness. We're showing people it can be done.â€Perhaps the biggest benefit to come out of the vegan beauty movement is that it's pushing consumers to assess ingredients. â€œPeople are starting to question and research what they're buying, and I think that's empowering,â€ Ms. Piasecka said.All signs point to an industry that's working toward being not only cleaner, but also vegan and cruelty-free. (CoverGirl, for instance, is now certified Leaping Bunny, the largest makeup brand to be so designated.) Ms. Subramanian used to know every vegan beauty brand. Now, she said, it's impossible to keep up. â€œThe future of the beauty industry is vegan and not animal-tested,â€ Ms. Guillermo said. â€œNot every company has realized this yet, but a lot of them have, and those are the ones that are going to get ahead and stay in business. We're in discussions with enough of them to know that this is, without question, the trend.â€"
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. New Zealand prepares for funeral services, Deutsche Bank's ties to President Trump come under greater scrutiny and Afghanistan receives a rare bit of good news. Here's the latest: As victims' families prepare for funeral services in Christchurch, we take a look at their stories.Among those killed at the two mosques were students, engineers, a dairy farmer, a new father and an aspiring pilot. Some were born in New Zealand and others had moved there.Today: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to return to Christchurch. A day earlier, she delivered an impassioned speech to Parliament, saying she would do everything she could to deny the gunman attention.â€œHe is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist,â€ she said. â€œBut he will, when I speak, be nameless.â€Egg Boy: A teenager who shot to worldwide fame after smashing an egg on the head of an Australian far-right politician said that â€œa majority of the moneyâ€ raised for him would go toward the victims of the shooting. (A GoFundMe page asked for money to cover legal fees and buy â€œmore eggs.â€)Go deeper: The suspect cited a racist conspiracy theory in his online manifesto. We explain what â€œthe replacement theoryâ€ is and how it caught on among white supremacists.Before Mr. Trump was elected, the German bank gave him more than $2 billion in loans to finance skyscrapers and other high-end properties, despite pushback from some at the bank.For Deutsche Bank, Mr. Trump's projects helped fund its investment-banking unit and his celebrity was used to lure more clients.Now, as investigators in New York and Washington scrutinize their financial ties, we examined their long and, at times, troubled bond.How we know: Deutsche Bank officials have said that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former executives and board members contradict that narrative. Read four takeaways from our investigation.Response: A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the company was â€œcommitted to cooperating with authorized investigations.â€ The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization, which declined to comment. The head of the country's Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, said he would resign at the end of his term in June amid a French corruption investigation into the bidding process for next year's Summer Games.In December, French investigators indicted Mr. Takeda — a former Olympic equestrian and chairman of the International Olympic Committee's marketing commission — as part of a broad criminal investigation that further stains the scandal-ridden reputation of the sporting event.Details: France suspects that the process of Tokyo's win was tainted. They say that hopeful officials representing potential host cities paid bribes to African Olympic committee members to win support.Reminder: The Tokyo Olympics in 2020 will be Japan's second time hosting the Summer Games and fourth games overall.Washington has been pushing Iraq to confront and sideline its neighbor, a move that has increased tensions not just with Baghdad but also within the Trump administration.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been leading the effort, and under his proposed plans, the State Department would designate Iran's military Islamic Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization — a first for a unit of another government's military.The plan would also expose Iraqi Shiite militias — some of which were trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards and several of which are legitimate players in Iraqi politics — to economic sanctions and travel restrictions.Pushback: American officials said that the plan would put U.S. troops and intelligence officers at risk of similar actions from foreign governments.ISIS: The spokesman of the terrorist group broke his monthslong silence to mock America's assertion it had defeated the group, and to call for retaliation over last week's mosque attacks in New Zealand. Separately, Iraqi truffle hunters have become the latest victims of the Islamic State kidnappings and killings.Cyclone Idai: A deadly cyclone struck Mozambique and neighboring parts of southern Africa this week, affecting 1.5 million people. The death toll is now in the dozens but is expected to rise far higher.U.S. flooding: Record floods pummeled the Midwest, inundating farmland and killing off livestock at a time when farmers and ranchers can least afford it.Cambodia: A government-controlled court issued arrest warrants for eight opposition leaders who have been living in exile but who say they have been trying to return. It's the latest effort by Prime Minister Hun Sen to sideline opposition and maintain his decades-long grip on power.Britain: The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has become an unlikely celebrity amid the chaos of Brexit, particularly after he denied Prime Minister Theresa May a third vote on her withdrawal plan.Google: The technology giant introduced a new video game streaming service, called Stadia, that will be released later this year, in an attempt to catch the next wave of gaming.PG&E: California's largest utility company has been linked to wildfires that destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres and killed dozens of people. Regulators found that in many fires, the company violated state law or could have done more. Here's how it overlooked the risks.Levi's: On Thursday, for the second time in its 165-year history, the company that invented the blue jean will start trading on public markets. Levi's has overhauled its image, operations and products in the past decade.Afghanistan: The country's beloved cricket team won its first-ever Test match, against Ireland, providing a rare bit of good news for the war-torn nation.Australia: An artist has proposed building a giant wooden bong to draw tourists to the town of Woodenbong in New South Wales. â€œHundreds and thousands of people share the same dream as soon as they hear the town's name,â€ he said.

Guggenheim Museum in New York City could be seen in an earlier design for a Maryland tourist attraction.When the museum, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, opened in 1959, it was both praised (â€œMr. Wright's greatest building. New York's greatest buildingâ€) and scorned (an â€œinverted oatmeal dishâ€).The museum took its cues from a design that Wright had experimented with before, initially for a project that was never built.In 1924, at the dawn of America's love affair with automobiles, a businessman named Gordon Strong worked with Wright on an attraction at the top of Sugarloaf Mountain in Maryland that would â€œserve as an objective for short motor tripsâ€ from nearby Washington and Baltimore.Wright designed a circular building with drivable ramps that wound around the outside like a ribbon. Strong hated it, likening the design to the Tower of Babel, and the project was later abandoned.But Wright believed in his vision enough to return to it decades later, in an inverted form, when he was asked by the Guggenheim to design a â€œtemple of the spirit, a monument.â€Karen Thorne, a content strategist, wrote today's Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — I did it. I found a significantly accomplished, defensibly qualified Democratic officeholder who isn't flirting with — and hasn't fantasized about — a presidential run in 2020. I had to take the train to Rhode Island, where we talked over pizza and eggplant parmigiana. We drank wine, too. It helps these days.Her name is Gina Raimondo. She's the governor of this state. She just began her second term after being re-elected by a margin of more than 15 percentage points, and you would think that this commanding victory plus her youth (she's 47), her working-class background, her educational pedigree (Harvard, Rhodes scholar, Yale Law), her role as the chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association and her situation far from the nation's swampy and unpopular capital would start chatter about a move there. But no. Crickets.The most obvious reason? Her relationship to the Democratic Party of the moment. Both stylistically and substantively, she's out of sync with it.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni's candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]She can't tweet worth a damn and the same goes for Instagram. She winces at talk of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent and cringes at the growing use of â€œcorporatistâ€ as a slur against Democratic politicians deemed too cozy with business interests. She thinks that big companies often need to be prodded forcefully to do right by their employees, but that it's bad policy and bad politics to paint them as the enemy.She recalled an exchange with college students not long ago. One of them said: â€œI get who you are. You're one of those spineless centrists.â€ â€œAnd I was like, â€˜Excuse me?',â€ she said. â€œIt takes a lot of spine to be a centrist in America today. You get whacked from the left and whacked from the right. That's my life. I get whacked.â€Moderate Democrats have certainly had their day and their sway. In fact the passions of the left arise in part from how much compromise there has been — and here we are stuck with Donald Trump. The rage of less moderate Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is earned and righteous. And Raimondo said precisely that to me.But Ocasio-Cortez is by no means the whole of the Democratic Party. And is the leftward lurch that she personifies the best and safest bet for 2020? I worry, because there's no political priority higher than limiting Trump to one term. Raimondo also worries — a lot.â€œSo many Democrats just assume we're going to win,â€ she said. â€œThey underestimate how hard it's going to be.â€ And it might be a serious tactical mistake, she added, to nominate any candidate who seems to be at war with capitalism itself or entertains the idea of a guaranteed minimum income.â€œWe have become the party that is anti-business,â€ she told me. â€œWe need to be the party of work.â€She acknowledged that â€œthe system we have today is totally broken.â€ She cited grotesque income inequality. She noted that too many Americans have no economic security and no prospects for achieving it.â€œBut I fall in the camp of: Let's fix it,â€ she said. â€œLet's embrace business to come to the table. Someone needs to make the case that it's in the best interest of businesses and wealthy people to be better corporate citizens. Pay for health care. Help people get their college degree. Pay for job training.â€Along those lines, she recently proposed that companies doing business in Rhode Island be taxed up to $1,500 annually for every employee who is enrolled in Medicaid because he or she can't get health insurance through a company-sponsored plan. â€œI hope that they're embarrassed,â€ she said.But, she added, â€œWhere I think we are at risk is if all we do is beat up and crap on businesses.â€That's an exaggeration of where the party is, but I take her point. And I'm fascinated by her unflashy example and the questions it raises about how we currently accord importance to politicians and how much that really relates to their impact.Journalists obsess over the most camera-ready emissaries and provocative assertions, and we often outsource our judgment to social media. To go viral is to be relevant. â€œIn the future,â€ the Politico media columnist Jack Shafer wrote a few days ago, â€œyour news source of choice will contain only stories about Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.â€ Shafer forgot Beto O'Rourke, which is funny, because he once wrote an excellent broadside about how political reporters can't forget him.When I checked social media during Raimondo's re-election campaign, I mostly saw people bashing her, and she wasn't bothering to engage with that hate. I assumed she was in trouble.But she won her primary against a progressive rival by more than 20 points, then trounced her Republican opponent in the general election, 52.8 percent to 37.3 percent. (Third-party candidates received the remainder of the vote.) She had ample support in the end. It just didn't show up on Twitter, where an overwhelming majority of Americans still spend no time at all.And that support undoubtedly reflects the concrete difference that Raimondo has made over the past four years. With aggressive tax incentives, she persuaded some two dozen companies to expand or establish operations in Rhode Island, creating what The Times's Katharine Seelye described as a â€œfrenzy of economic and job development.â€ For most of the year before she took office, the state's unemployment rate was well above the nation's; at the end of last month, it was the same — 3.9 percent.Thanks to her advocacy, Rhode Island is among a minority of states in which community college is free. And thanks to a tax that she levied on large commercial trucks, its awful infrastructure is receiving desperately needed repairs and upgrades.K-through-12 public education, however, remains a mess. And Raimondo has stains on her record, including the botched rollout of a $650 million public-assistance computer system that wasn't ready, wreaking epic havoc. To get re-elected, she raised — and spent — significantly more money than her opponents. And many Democrats fairly question whether her corporate giveaways had to be as generous as they were.But some of them obviously backed her anyway. â€œAt the end of the day,â€ Raimondo said, â€œpeople want a decent job, and I think they thought that I was the candidate who was going to bring that to them and their families.â€And that's a political reality — and a glimpse into the electorate — that shouldn't be forgotten as Democrats plot their course. The media attention to full-throttle progressives among newly elected House Democrats is disproportionate to their numbers, and it sometimes obscures a sizable, practical middle. Besides, their more moderate peers are the ones who wrested seats from Republicans in districts that, like America, aren't deep red or emphatically blue.â€œI don't think the lefties can win a general election,â€ Raimondo said. But, she conceded, â€œWho knows? I'm not running in 2020.  I could have missed the boat.â€"
"NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan announced on Thursday that his country would be releasing a captured pilot from India after days of military conflict, offering a way out of the crisis and seeking to position Pakistan as the cooler head in a confrontation that has put the world on edge.â€œIn our desire of peace, I announce that tomorrow, and as a first step to open negotiations, Pakistan will be releasing the Indian Air Force officer in our custody,â€ Mr. Khan said.After hours of relative lull throughout Thursday, the gesture appeared to be a face-saving opening for both countries to head off a war. But Indian officials were guarded, saying that the pilot's release would not necessarily end the crisis, which they said was rooted in Pakistan's support of terrorist groups that strike at India.The days before had brought both nations to the brink. On Tuesday, Indian warplanes dropped bombs inside Pakistan — it is not clear what they hit — and Pakistan shot down at least one Indian fighter jet on Wednesday. Tens of thousands of troops have been rushed to the countries' border, heavy artillery barrages and gunfire have been volleyed across it, and tank columns have been chugging into place for what many feared could turn into a full-blown war.Both nations wield nuclear weapons, and China, the United States, Britain and many other countries have been urging them to step away from conflict, which began after a suicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian paramilitary troops in the disputed region of Kashmir on Feb. 14. India accuses Pakistan of aiding in the attack, which was claimed by the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed, but Pakistan has denied it.At a news conference after his summit meeting in Vietnam on Thursday, President Trump said that there was â€œreasonably decentâ€ news coming from India and Pakistan and â€œhopefully it's going to be coming to an end.â€From the beginning of the showdown, Pakistan's military publicity wing has demonstrated a knack for dominating the narrative. In particular, the almost immediate official circulation of videos that appeared to show the Indian pilot being first protected from a mob by Pakistani forces, and then remarking on how well he was being treated (â€œThe tea is fantastic!â€ he said in one clip), became a virally blooming propaganda coup on social media.But on Thursday, Indian officials insisted that was part of the problem — and made a point of noting that displaying prisoners for propaganda purposes violates the Geneva Conventions.They suggested that Mr. Khan's move was an empty ploy that ignored the real problem between the two countries. A senior Indian official told reporters in New Delhi that even if the captured pilot were returned home, there would be no chance â€œto go back to zeroâ€ and ease tensions unless Pakistan acted against terrorist groups that it has traditionally used as proxies against India.Some observers said that much of the Indian public — and particularly among Prime Minister Narendra Modi's conservative Hindu political base — had little appetite to take Mr. Khan up on his second offer of the day: to engage in direct talks with Mr. Modi in order to defuse the crisis.â€œOver the decades there's been a real exhaustion and fatigue with Pakistan, and any Indian right now is fed up with Pakistan's lack of action against terror,â€ said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. â€œIndians feel Pakistan is not genuine in its calls for dialogue.â€Pakistan has, however, been better about wielding its public information campaigns.For instance, when India for the first time in almost 50 years sent fighter jets into Pakistani airspace to launch airstrikes, it was Pakistan that took to social media first.Hours before any comment from India, a Pakistani military officer tweeted that Indian warplanes had bombed an empty forest and the officer posted photographs showing some craters in the dirt. Later, India claimed to have destroyed a terrorist training camp, but had no evidence to show for it.On Wednesday, after reports started surfacing online that Pakistan had shot down an Indian fighter jet and captured the pilot, Indian officials denied it. Hours later, they said during a stiff news conference that lasted less than 100 seconds that one Indian pilot was â€œmissing in action.â€But again, Pakistan had the jump. For three hours â€“ an eternity in social media time — videos were going viral on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp showing the captured Indian airman in a Pakistan military facility talking with Pakistani officers.In public, Mr. Khan, a former international cricket star who became prime minister last summer, has tried to appear calm. Early in the crisis, he called for de-escalation, and promised to investigate any evidence linking Pakistan to Jaish-e-Mohammed's bombings, if India would only share the evidence.And on Wednesday, even as he claimed that Pakistan had had no choice but to retaliate for India's airstrikes around Balakot the day before, he also expressed concern that the two countries must calm hostilities rather than risk nuclear war.Behind the calm exterior, though, is the widespread belief that Pakistan is in no shape right now to wage a major war. Its economy is in deep trouble, with the country running out of hard currency. And most other nations — including China, which has traditionally taken Pakistan's side in disputes — have pressed Pakistan to take more action against terrorist groups.In the propaganda war of the past few days, both countries have been guilty of missteps. Pakistan maintained for a day that it had shot down two Indian fighter jets and captured two pilots, only later revising it down to one on each count.But it is India that has suffered the more glaring contradictions. The government has yet to offer any evidence publicly for its claim that it downed a Pakistan plane, which Indian officials say crashed beyond their border. Likewise, India has offered no proof that its initial airstrike on Tuesday killed â€œa very large numberâ€ of â€œterrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis,â€ as India's foreign secretary has claimed.Videos of a crushed building filled with bodies that soon began circulating widely on social media in India were quickly debunked. The images were not from the airstrike but from an earthquake in Pakistan more than 10 years ago.This is beginning to take its toll on Mr. Modi, who is up for election in about two months and who until recently seemed invincible. But in some sectors, he is now being accused of military adventurism. One family of a fallen soldier called the government a liar.Other Indians seem frustrated.â€œThe government has been lax and inaccurate in the way information is being let out,'' said Mohammad Saquib, who works at a hotel in Delhi.On the Pakistani side, initial fears that the confrontation could slip into war appeared to give way to jubilation at the news that an Indian jet had been shot down and that the pilot, identified by India as Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, had been captured.Even in the Pakistani media, which has suffered from intense repression by the security forces and initially was introspective about the military's relationship with militant groups, skepticism has given way to triumphalism. Most criticism was shelved once Indian warplanes crossed Kashmir's Line of Control on Tuesday.By Thursday morning, upbeat news anchors appeared on television screens across Pakistan donning military fatigues, and journalists waved their national flag while delivering breaking developments.Saadia Afzal, a popular Pakistani news anchor, tweeted a photo of herself posing in front of the wreckage of the downed Indian plane, surrounded by soldiers. â€œTake that India,â€ she tweeted.â€œThe Indian media was so jingoistic that even the most critical Pakistanis changed their position and said they were going to stand by their military and state,â€ said Raza Ahmad Rumi, the editor for The Daily Times in Lahore.Perhaps the most telling moment in the information war came on Thursday, when Pakistan seized what could have been India's triumphant moment, the return of the pilot.On Thursday afternoon, the whispers from advisers in Mr. Modi's government were that top Indian generals were ready to make a major announcement at 5 p.m. But well before that time, there was Mr. Khan, standing in Parliament and breaking the news, on live television, that Pakistan would unilaterally send the Indian pilot home."
"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kevin Roose, a technology columnist in New York who has been writing about disinformation online, discussed the tech he's using.Q. As a technology columnist, what are some of your favorite tech tools for work?A. For work, I use a company-issued MacBook Pro. I hate, hate, hate the keyboard on it, so I sometimes use an external keyboard, which makes me look incredibly cool at the coffee shop. But my only other option is using my MacBook Air, which is about seven years old, runs out of hard drive space every time I use it and has a battery life of maybe 20 minutes. A few years ago, I got hacked really badly. (It was my own fault — I was hosting a TV show about tech and volunteered to have a few professional hackers attack me, as an experiment.) As a result, I'm pretty paranoid. I use physical security keys, VPNs, an encrypted email provider, and half a dozen secure texting apps to communicate with sources and colleagues.I know I should be using to-do apps and bullet journaling, but I'm still pretty old school about taking notes. I carry a little brown Field Notes notebook in my shirt pocket, and I write down everything that could possibly be of interest — story ideas, errands to run, people I need to call, words I want to look up — in my atrocious chicken-scratch handwriting, in no particular order. When I fill up a notebook, I add it to a big pile on my bookshelf. I'm excited to reread them all when I'm old and nostalgic, and see some indecipherable interview notes along with 46 pages of â€œCALL WALGREENS.â€When I really need to get work done, I use an app called SelfControl, which blocks my access to certain potentially distracting websites for a set period of time. Mine is set to block Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit, and I usually set it for two or three hours at a time.I also bought noise-canceling headphones this year, because my colleagues, God love them, are always talking on the phone with their sources. I'm pretty into a Spotify playlist called Focus Flow, which is perfect for drowning out their lovely, incessant yakking.What are some of the trade-offs of using this tech?I like taking physical notes because I retain information better when it's written on actual paper. The downside is that I spend a lot of time scrambling around my apartment looking for the notebook I left in a jacket pocket or under the sofa.There's also a definite trade-off between security and convenience. I probably spend 30 percent of my day typing in two-factor authentication codes. But I sleep better than I used to.You've been covering the spread of online disinformation in the run-up to the midterm elections. What is your advice for spotting disinformation? What tools do you use to do that?A lot of spotting disinformation is hanging out in the right places. I spend a fair amount of time on Reddit and 4chan and in private Facebook groups where a lot of hoaxes and viral rumors tend to originate. I also rely on tips from our readers, who have been submitting hundreds of examples of disinformation from their own feeds. And Twitter (deep, heaving sigh) is useful, too.Recently, I've also been spending a lot of time on Crowdtangle, a tool that allows you to see what's spreading rapidly across Facebook at any given moment. (Crowdtangle used to be an independent company, but Facebook bought it in 2016.) I have a series of dashboards set up that allow me to monitor thousands of Facebook pages on different topics and see which false claims are being shared by which people and pages.What kind of election-related tech shenanigans have you seen recently?There have been a fair number of shenanigans on social media this cycle — things like coordinated influence campaigns, fake Facebook ads, and hacking attempts on campaigns and think tanks. We've also seen new forms of disinformation, including the spreading of false claims over peer-to-peer texting apps.What are you doing to combat those annoying robotexts?I actually haven't gotten that many political robotexts. I do get frequent robotexts from a Caribbean restaurant in Queens, which I've never been to but whose promotional list I somehow got on. (I will make it to the Friday night fish fry soon, I promise.)Outside of work, what tech product are you obsessed with?I cook a lot, and I'm still pretty into my Instant Pot. I've also been working on my sleep recently, which is very Arianna Huffington of me. Recently, I bought a $15 noise machine on Amazon, which is a little hockey-puck-size speaker that has six or seven settings. You can fill your bedroom with jungle noises, or ocean waves, or crickets on a summer night. It's phenomenal. On the recommendation of several friends, I also bought a gravity blanket, which is weighted down with heavy beads. It's meant for people with anxiety, but I just like the way it sits heavy on my body and prevents me from rolling over too much at night. I have the 25-pound version.What could be better about it?I wish the blankets came in heavier weights."
"LAHORE, Pakistan — I am a self-hating yoga practitioner. I used to wonder: If I don't like yoga, why do I do it? I pretend to do it only for health benefits. I really just do it for savasana. For those who haven't practiced yoga: Toward the end of the class you are asked to lie down and stay still, the lights are usually turned down, and you are supposed to do nothing, think nothing. Savasana is the opposite of activity.Doing nothing is my favorite thing in life. I believe in the ancient practice of doing nothing. I believe that this planet is doomed because we so believe in doing things that now the world's most recognized dictum is â€œJust do it.â€ But how can you think nothing? Especially when you're told to think nothing?In yoga, after you have elevated your heart above your head in Downward Dog and after you have reared your head like a cobra many times over, you are finally allowed to let your shoulders sag and your body go, and to set your mind free. My mind is too afraid of thinking nothing, so it usually goes into overdrive.Before I knew the literal meaning of savasana, I used to send my mind on anxiety hunts. A therapist once told me that one way to deal with your anxieties is to chase them, to hunt them down. â€œThink what's making you anxious,â€ she said, â€œand think of the absolute worst that can happen, multiply it by 10, and then you'll realize that the present isn't that bad after all.â€The yoga instructor says, â€œBreathe into your pose.â€ Sometimes I forget to breathe because I am busy making lists. Like a list of my random anxieties. The traffic outside is terrible; will I find parking outside Haji Stores? Those brown eggs they sell — are they really organic or just free range? Breathe. I can hear people breathing around me. They've probably cleared their heads, slain all their anxieties, and I'm wondering if I'll get any likes for that random half-clever thing I tweeted before the class.I do journalism in three languages, so my capacity for distractions is threefold. While I am going through the shopping list — milk, brown bread, cigarettes and what's that thing I'm forgetting? — I am also prepping for my little boy's dinner and thinking about how much flour to add to the soup. Last night, it was too thin; the night before that, too thick. How not to burn the chicken nugget? My son ostensibly is a yoga baby. He was conceived right after my wife started yoga. I have been told off by my wife for thinking of yoga as a competitive sport, but sometimes yoga instructors remind me of the drill sergeants of my youth. Drill sergeants trapped in poets' bodies. They talk a lot about the soul. But maybe they have a soul and I don't. And how can I harness something I don't have?Halfway through my years of yoga distractions, I searched online for the word â€œsavasana.â€ And that changed yoga for me: Savasana means â€œcorpse pose.â€When I moved to a new class, my new teacher said: â€œDon't worry. It's your first week, you'll get better at it.â€ I was so smug in my knowledge that I'll never be good enough that I didn't tell her I had been doing yoga for three years. In the previous class, I had occasionally heard, â€œWell done, Hanif.â€ I always wanted to say: That 20-year-old girl who does the bridge like a bridge and becomes a tree when she does a tree, that's good. I am just a recipient of your good yogi intentions. I am just a corpse with lists.â€œBreathe into the pain,â€ the yoga teacher says, and I think of other corpses that I have seen in recent years.I had a musician friend once who found out that he was about to die and he started writing poetry. Did everyone say that he was good because they knew that he was dying? I knew he was always good at poetry. He used to have a book on yoga but never practiced it.Inhale. Hold. Exhale.Another friend died. He wasn't a poet or a singer. But he was very funny. And sometimes not funny at all. I miss him more because he didn't leave any poetry behind. He probably would have approved of my doing yoga, and then made fun of me and told me there is no such thing as free-range chicken.And another friend died. She was funny, fierce and tender. She made a life out of being that. She never had time for yoga. Only street cricket. I console myself by thinking that all of them are in an eternal savasana without any lists.The yoga teacher says, hug yourself. I do hug myself, but I am thinking: Here's a grown-up telling other grown-ups to hug themselves. I hug myself and think of a friend who is still alive. He was the first person in our group to discover yoga. He had chronic asthma. He took some classes, saved money, wrangled a visa to India and studied with some famous yoga teachers. We lost touch. Recently I found out that he has become much sought after as a yoga teacher and does only private classes.I ran into him and we arranged to meet for lunch. He told me what yoga has done for him. He is a mountain climber now, a serious one. He has reached eight of the world's highest peaks. He saved $50,000 by teaching yoga. That's the amount it takes to climb Mount Everest. Some people do it for much more. He said he did it the simple way.We recalled that when we were young and lived on the same street and used to send out our C.V.s, employers looked at our address and threw them away. Our address was known for having constant troubles and long curfews. My friend, a lower-middle-class boy, has cured his own asthma through yoga, then gone on to climb the world's highest peak. In the class, I cheat on my breathing exercises and wait for savasana to begin."
"LONDON — In theory at least, we understand the words on the sports radio we hear incessantly — in taxis, at the fish and chips place, at the corner newsstand. But we are foreigners here and the stories are inscrutable, full of happenings from cricket ovals and rugby pitches.Our sports focus is confined to our darkened living room, where my 7-year-old son, Leo, and I have lately been absorbing improbable happenings from the other side of the Atlantic — one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty Brooklyn Nets.This has become our early-morning ritual. Wife and daughter still asleep, the boys watch the action from the night before, the scores carefully hidden from our N.B.A. League Pass app lest we ruin the ending.We are basketball expatriates, two steps removed from the initial source of my N.B.A. obsession by a change of team loyalties and a move to London.In our North London surroundings, we may as well be rooting for a badminton team from Bhutan. While the odd LeBron James jersey can be spotted, our Brooklyn Nets gear seemingly fades into the sea of Yankees caps brought home by tourists returning from New York (oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this Mets fan) and the endless Brooklyn-related mumbo jumbo that now adorns T-shirts worldwide.[Nets' Run to the Playoffs Hits a Snag With Spencer Dinwiddie Injury]While N.F.L. gear is a common sighting, owing to the constant staging of American football games here, N.B.A. basketball is largely invisible. One imagines this was unaltered by the recent showdown of two of the league's most dreadful teams, the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, inside London's unlovable O2 arena. (We did not attend, just as we do not take leisure trips to see the dentist.)Our sports-related conversations with Britons tend to revolve around the astronomical ticket prices required to see Arsenal, the English Premier League soccer team Leo has decided that we love forever. Our Nets fandom is like membership in a secret society, whose disclosure would mark us as eccentric and produce puzzlement.Even my Knick fan friends back in New York do not want to hear about the Nets via email. My only real communion comes via obscure Nets-related podcasts I listen to while washing the dishes. When Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe devoted perhaps 3 minutes of a recent pod to the Nets surge, I confess to feelings of pride and validation I can only liken to a U.F.O. conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer.My embrace of the Nets began seven years ago when the Knicks — the only team I had ever rooted for — shunned a gift from the basketball gods by letting Jeremy Lin leave town. It was the final indignity after years of atrocious basketball. I dumped my Knicks season tickets and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my Brooklyn neighborhood.I did not do so lightly. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I saw abandoning a team as a serious breach of the tribal code. I disdained fans from other cities who rooted for two teams in the same sport. I was unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all: the bandwagon fan. (If that Steph Curry jersey you own was the first Warriors gear in your closet, yes, I'm talking about you.)But I was hopping on no bandwagon. With the exception of a pair of distant trips to the N.B.A. finals, the New Jersey-turned-Brooklyn Nets were a pathetic franchise. I was living in Brooklyn. My father had grown up in Queens and traveled on a streetcar to watch the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. I was not abandoning my tribe. I was returning to it.This is what I told myself as I began reading about the odd collection of players I was now rooting for, trying to divine the narrative that would make it real. I fought through a sense of exile in the slick, new Barclays Center, which was full of fans for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool Brooklyn food, the dancing during timeouts, and whatever fascinating things were happening on their phones.Yes, it was a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff. The season tickets I bought the day the Knicks said goodbye to J-Lin put me in seats that were a 10-minute walk from my house in Prospect Heights. Madison Square Garden was a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowels of Penn Station.Yet there was something about the Garden, even as the Dolan era yielded a lost decade of basketball. The crowd understood. Hustle plays drew appreciation in an arena that had revered Charles Oakley. The energy was electric.In Brooklyn, the mostly mercenary fans got what we deserved: a team of past-their-prime castoffs imported by the bombastic Russian magnate, Mikhail Prokhorov, who had brought the franchise to Brooklyn. Vowing to spend whatever it took to eclipse the Knicks — a low bar — he built a bonfire of money at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic.In came the wildly overpaid Joe Johnson, a seven-time All-Star. In came the mediocre Gerald Wallace in exchange for a first-round pick that Portland turned into Damian Lillard. The centerpiece was the sullen, out-of-shape Deron Williams who, in another lifetime, looked like the best point guard on earth, and whose passions no longer appeared to include basketball.They fit uneasily around the likable 7-footer, Brook Lopez, whose sweet shooting came along with rebounding and defensive skills that seemed better suited for other pursuits, like calligraphy.My history as a Knicks fan made the plan feel familiar. Win now, baby! The future was for losers. The oligarch was buying his way to competitiveness pronto. Leaving no doubt, the Nets soon traded every first-round pick until the sun dies for the remains of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.When it all unraveled and the Nets descended into an unwatchable state, I hung in. You can not renounce the team of your life and then walk away from your new one because they are terrible. Real fandom is forged in suffering. Even when my family traded Brooklyn for London in 2016, we remained Nets fans.This happily coincided with another development: The Nets bucked the conventional wisdom that New York fans will not accept rebuilding and embraced patience.Sean Marks, the general manager, somehow turned a collection of mostly indifferent veterans into a raffish crew of young, hungry players led by a first-time head coach, Kenny Atkinson. They run at a ferocious pace, share the ball with grace, and play with joy.Since an excruciating eight-game losing streak, the Nets have won 18 of 23. Even from afar, we can tell that the intensity has changed at the Barclays, the Brooook-Lyyyyn chants filling our London living room.And still, an intense New York team deserves better. Back for the holidays, I took Leo to see New Orleans and their marquee star, Anthony Davis, at Barclays. The place was packed with tourists who seemed intent on taking selfies and buying Brooklyn gear at the swag shop.Whatever.On Saturday morning, we will sit on the couch in our pajamas, Leo and me, and see what happened against the now-hated, if pitiful, Knicks the night before.Please don't tell us who won."
"Fred Thompson, who founded a Brooklyn track club for girls and young women in 1963 and coached national and Olympic medalists as he championed the cause of female track-and-field athletes for a half-century, died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 85.Lorna Forde, a former track star for Mr. Thompson, said the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease.A lawyer and former New York State assistant attorney general, Mr. Thompson founded the Atoms Track Club of Brooklyn in a Bedford-Stuyvesant community center, mostly out of frustration with New York City public schools that, for budgetary and other reasons, limited the participation of girls, but not necessarily of boys, in physical education and high school sports.Mr. Thompson was also the founding organizer of the annual Colgate Women's Games, the nation's largest amateur track series for women. Since 1974, the games, open to girls and women from elementary school through college (and with a competitive division for women over 30), have attracted thousands of participants, mostly from East Coast states, to various venues from Boston to Virginia.A former track star at Boys High School in Brooklyn and the City College of New York, Mr. Thompson inspired remarkable loyalty in his Atoms, which often had 40 to 50 members. Most were runners, some as young as 9, but most were teenagers who regarded him as a counselor, friend and father figure. He paid nearly all the expenses of the club, which was independent of schools or sponsors.Early on, the Atoms practiced in community center hallways or in locked schoolyards (by scaling fences at twilight). But he eventually found a home for the club at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.His coaching combined sophisticated training techniques with one-on-one skull sessions. And beyond coaching, he demanded good grades and personal responsibility from his athletes.â€œThe Atoms doesn't really stand for track,â€ he told The New York Times in 1978. â€œThe Atoms stands for excellence in education, trying to better yourself in this society, and one way to do that is to go to college and get that piece of paper.â€For many Atoms, the club was a refuge from broken homes and lives of poverty, as well as a path to education and upward mobility. In time, despite financial and logistical obstacles and a lack of the public support that flows readily to football, basketball and baseball, the club became a symbol of inner-city success as its runners won regional, national and finally Olympic recognition.Its stars included Cheryl Toussaint-Eason, a silver medalist at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the 1,600-meter relay and a gold medalist at the Pan American Games; Diane Dixon, who won Olympic gold in Los Angeles in 1984 in the 400-meter relay and was an 11-time national indoor champion; and Grace Jackson-Small, the silver medalist in the 200-meter sprint at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Mr. Thompson was an assistant coach of the United States track team in Seoul.Many of the Atoms' victories could not be clocked by stopwatches. In its first 15 years, the club produced 50 college graduates, a remarkable record given the economic status of their families. They became teachers, lawyers, nurses, psychologists, entrepreneurs — and mothers. â€œOne's a doctor now, and another runs a study program in a state college,â€ Mr. Thompson told The Times in 1979.â€œBut we've lost some, too,â€ he added. â€œWe had a little girl we called Cricket who still holds the 100-yard dash record for 12- and 13-year-olds. But the streets got her. She stopped coming to practice. Another girl, a shot-putter named Diane, they found her dead from an overdose of drugs. I made all my girls go to her funeral. It wasn't easy. They were crying. They took it hard. But I thought it was something they should see.â€The coach often sounded like a father, although he was a bachelor and had no children. â€œI've always been single,â€ he told the Times sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi in 1985. â€œI came close to getting married twice. I miss not having a kid. People say, â€˜You have many kids,' but it's not the same.â€Frederick Delano Thompson was born in Brooklyn on May 21, 1933. When he was 5, his parents, Hector Joseph Thompson and Evelyn Cethas, split up, and Fred and his brother, John, were sent to live with an aunt, Ira Johnson, who had a deep influence on the boys.â€œLife is two things,â€ Mr. Thompson recalled her saying. â€œOne, get an education, because once you have a college diploma nobody can take that away from you. And two, get involved with people.â€Fred followed both suggestions. He grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant and graduated from Boys High in 1950. At City College, he began as a chemical engineering major but switched to history and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1955. He then studied law at St. John's University, earning his degree in 1958.After two years in the Army, he was admitted to the state bar in 1961 and opened a private law practice in Brooklyn. He worked mostly on negligence cases.Aware of the city's shortage of track facilities for the young, and particularly concerned about limited girls' participation in intramural and interscholastic sports activities, Mr. Thompson followed his aunt's advice to become involved. He became a civilian volunteer with the Police Athletic League and then founded the Atoms Track Club. Soon he had dozens of members.â€œMost of them are not from circumstances and surroundings that you would call ideal,â€ he told The Times. â€œThey have home problems, social problems, boy problems and many other problems. You can't just sweep these under the rug if you want to see them develop their talents and succeed in life. So I involve myself.â€A decade later, in 1972, the landmark federal legislation known as Title IX, which banned sex discrimination in any educational program receiving federal funds, became law. It was the beginning of a sea change for female athletes. Before the law, about 310,000 girls and women in America were participating in high school and college sports. Today, federal officials say, there are 3.3 million.Mr. Thompson, who handled legal cases for ABC-TV, the Federal Trade Commission and Madison Square Garden and was an assistant state attorney general from 1967 to 1969, gave up law practice in 1974, when he became the full-time paid director of the Colgate Women's Games. Sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive, the games have been a huge, complex operation, often attracting as many as 20,000 competitors of all ages.He remained the coach of the Atoms until after the turn of the century, when its membership began to dwindle, and directed the Colgate Women's Games for 40 years until his retirement in 2014.Mr. Thompson, whose brother died some years ago, leaves no immediate survivors. He had Alzheimer's disease in recent years but remained at his home in Brooklyn, cared for by Ms. Forde, one of his best and most devoted former runners. A sprinter from Barbados, she competed in the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics and in the 1975 Pan American Games.â€œFred Thompson is one of those special people that a sport such as track and field needs,â€ the Times columnist Dave Anderson wrote in 1979. â€œIn the big money sports, a coach can always dream of going on to a lucrative career in college or in the pros. In track and field, there is no big money as there is in football or basketball. In track and field, the love of the sport is true; the dream is pure.â€"
"When Indra Nooyi stepped down as chief executive of PepsiCo last year, she was replaced by a man — and the ranks of female C.E.O.s further dwindled. Today, fewer than 5 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 are led by women. Ms. Nooyi's absence will be particularly notable. During her 12 years running Pepsi, she increased the company's top-line revenues while expanding its offerings to include healthier foods. At the same time, she fended off activist investors calling for higher short-term profits. Her tenure was not without controversy, though. Health advocates pushed the company to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and fat in its products. Pepsi was accused of deceptive marketing practices. And Ms. Nooyi was among the business leaders who stepped down from presidential advisory councils after President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. Though the White House reportedly considered Ms. Nooyi to be World Bank president, she did not wind up with the job. Instead, she will be teaching at West Point, and recently joined the board of Amazon. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York. You joined the board of Amazon just after its about-face on building a new headquarters in New York. What happened? New York was making an investment in Amazon in the short term to get many years of benefits. It's very hard to explain the many years of benefits. People just worry about what short-term investment you're giving. It was a big loss for New York.Philosophically, where do you stand on this?It's a competitive environment. Every state is competing for those jobs. So it becomes a race between the states, each one putting up the right incentives to get the companies. I'm not sure the companies themselves are demanding it. I think they just said, â€œWe want another headquarters,â€ and there's a feeding frenzy from all the states.Should companies really participate in this race to the bottom and pit states against one another? If companies don't get the incentives, the shareholders are going to say, â€œWhy didn't you get the incentives?â€ I've heard that before. â€œDid you get the incentives from the state? Did you get the maximum tax reductions from the state?â€ The shareholder community expects it from you.What was your childhood like? I grew up in Madras, which is now Chennai. We never lacked for anything, but we didn't have much. It was a good, conservative Brahmin family, deeply steeped in learning and education. That was the only focus. The expectation was you would get, at a minimum, a master's degree. If you got a Ph.D., you're better off. We were the ultimate nerds. The only difference was, in my case, I decided to be a nerd in some ways and branch out in other ways. I played cricket. I climbed trees. I played the guitar. I did all those wild and wacky things.What was it like for you when you arrived in the U.S. to attend the Yale School of Management?I got dropped off in New Haven and had nobody to help me. They didn't have support systems for international students. They gave you a map and said: â€œGo register for classes here. Go do this there.â€ I was a vegetarian, so I didn't know what to eat. I needed curds for every meal, but I didn't know where to get them. Then somebody said: â€œIt's the same as yogurt. Go get yogurt.â€ The first few weeks were very tough. But little by little, the international students banded together, because we were all miserable without any support systems. Pretty soon, we were having a wonderful time. What were the big takeaways from your time at Yale? The school had just started, and the basic belief, which is more relevant now than ever, was that companies are members of society, and what you do has to be viewed as through a stakeholder lens, not just a shareholder lens. They steeped all of us in that thinking.There was a moment early in your career when you had the chance to go to a few different companies, including G.E. and Monsanto. Why did you choose Pepsi? Wayne Calloway, who was then C.E.O. of Pepsi, was a man of few of words. He called me at the last minute, just before I was going to join G.E., and made an amazing pitch. He was on the board of G.E., and he said: â€œI hear you're going to join G.E. It's a great company, and Jack Welch is a great C.E.O. But my need at Pepsi is greater than Jack's. We don't have somebody like you here, and you'll make a bigger difference at PepsiCo.â€ They didn't have somebody of my ethnicity or international outlook who was female in senior management at PepsiCo. When did you start thinking about the need for Pepsi to be more than a soda and snacks company? The first recognition came, I think, in 2000, when I was head of strategy. The marketplace was changing. It was changing slowly, but we had to make some moves before it changed too fast. We could see articles on health and wellness were picking up speed. We bought Quaker Oats in 2000 because we had no food brand that could play in the morning. It was also clear that beverage habits were changing. Our own employees' consumption was changing. It went from regular Pepsi to Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max. Everywhere you looked, you could see that consumption of low-calorie, zero-calorie products was increasing.How do you get a big multinational company to buy into such a dramatic change in strategy? If the C.E.O. doesn't feel the change, as opposed to just talking about the change, people will see right through it. So the first thing I had to do was make sure that whenever I talked to employees about it, I shared experiences, observations, data. I talked about water shortages in parts of the world. I would show them examples of plastic waste, the lack of recycling programs and what that could do to the environment. And I would talk about people's consumption of fat, sugar and salt.We had town halls and invited the spouses of employees to come. At one in Egypt, a lady stood up and said, â€œMy husband's going to be mad I'm saying this, but I have a kid who's 2, and I read every label, and I'm not willing to give my child all PepsiCo products.â€Plenty of people questioned the strategy. What made you stick with it? Our board bought into the strategy. If your board is not on your side, it doesn't work. But they said, â€œWhat you're doing with the portfolio, what you're doing with the whole environment and sustainability issue, what you're going to do with the focus on diversity — this is the right way to move the company forward.â€And I told them: â€œThis means that I'm not going to focus on beating every index. I'm going to focus on duration of returns, rather than level of returns for a short time.â€ And the board said, â€œYes, that's the right way to go at it.â€But if you're really committed to health, why keep selling soda and chips? Mountain Dew is a fantastic brand. It's a great franchise. I'm not here to tell you what to eat or drink. My job is to give you a choice of products, between fun for you, better for you and good for you. I'll give you nutritious products. I'll give you low-calorie products. I'll give you indulgent products.I have to make sure that the good-for-you products aren't more expensive than the fun-for-you products, and that the good-for-you products don't taste awful while the fun-for-you products taste great. But if I make all the products ubiquitously available, priced reasonably the same and they all taste great, ultimately it's a consumer choice. And if I put the right amount of advertising dollars between the whole portfolio, I'm letting the consumer decide.What did you learn from your time fighting with activists such as Nelson Peltz?I always told Nelson: â€œYou may be an external activist, but I'm an internal activist. I've got a lot of stock. So if you have an idea to improve the company, I'll implement it. But if you have a radical, short-term idea that destroys the company in the long term, uh-uh, ain't going to work. I'm not going to do it, and my board is not going to accept it.â€What was it like working with President Trump on the Strategic and Policy Forum? Each of the meetings was constructive. He gave us his undivided attention. He listened to everything we had to say. And he could not have been nicer. He went out of his way to drink Diet Pepsi when I was there. Was it a mistake to disband the forum after his response to the violence in Charlottesville?Yes and no. We all regretted disbanding the forum. But the fact of the matter is, there were other issues that took the focus away from the good work we were doing. And when you're facing that sort of criticism, it's very hard to remain engaged.What is it going to take to get more women in the C-suite? The issue is not women in the C-suite, it's a leaky pipeline. The pipeline is leaking at the early stages. Because we get enough women coming into the work force in various stages. But by the time they get to Level 2 and Level 3, they just drop out of the work force for several reasons. One that can be addressed quickly is this tremendous unconscious bias. On top of that, the time that they get to Level 2 in a company is when they will have families, and many companies are not mandated to give parental leave. People just drop out of the work force, and then we wonder why they don't go up to the top. We can ill afford to be a country where women drop out of the work force."
"Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times. Like what you see? Send this to a friend. If someone forwarded it to you, sign up here to have the next issue delivered to your inbox.By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.It's springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: â€œIowa Winter Texanâ€ and â€œI'm retired. Go around.â€â€œIt gets me out of the snowbanks,â€ said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. â€œYou'll go to some event down here and you'll find your neighbor from back home.â€The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president's assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.â€œWe don't see what you see on TV,â€ said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.What do Winter Texans see, exactly?A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan's fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, â€œThe Ethel and Albert Comedies.â€ At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort's ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.â€œWe don't take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, â€˜Oh, let's go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,'â€ Ms. Hitzemann said. â€œI was like, â€˜Oh my gosh, this isn't any cheaper than Walmart.' So we ended up not buying any medications.â€In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: â€œBe more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!â€ and â€œHave channel 5 respect Mr. Trumpâ€ and â€œKeep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.â€Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.â€œI think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,â€ said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.â€œThe motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,â€ Mr. Lane said.Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border.

But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.â€— Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers' reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration's border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president's crackdown on illegal immigration.Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times's Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon's story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week. Read more about it here.This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, â€œOnly Here,â€ about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — â€œthe art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,â€ they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented, and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:â€¢ â€œThe Green Line,â€ produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump's policies — and both appeared at his side in the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)â€¢ Last spring, WNYC's Radiolab ran â€œBorder Project,â€ a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it. Listen to all the episodes here.â€¢ This episode of PRX's Radio Diaries, â€œThe Border Wall,â€ focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a â€œno-man's land,â€ cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn't always follow the line it's meant to.â€¢ Our very own â€œDailyâ€ podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, â€œDispatches From the Borderâ€ (Part 1 here and Part 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there's this episode, â€œThe Scars of Family Separation,â€ about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, â€œHow Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policyâ€ is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.Read earlier installments of Crossing the Border here.

"The wounded tried to crawl away or lie still, while others ran or crouched behind the dead, but the gunman kept pulling the trigger.He shot fleeing women and girls, and pumped bullet after bullet into piles of motionless men and boys in a house of worship.The man accused of carrying out the worst mass murder in New Zealand's modern history, one that left 49 people dead and more than 40 others wounded at two mosques in Christchurch, was identified in court documents on Saturday as Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28. The suspect, who officials said is an Australian citizen, was charged with one count of murder, and more were expected to come.Three other people were detained by the police, though one was released hours later. An 18-year-old local man was charged with â€œintent to excite hostility or ill-will,â€ but court officials would not elaborate.The horror was designed specifically for an era that has married social media and racism — a massacre apparently motivated by white extremist hatred, streamed live on Facebook and calculated to go viral.The shooting represented a staggering corruption of a form of communication, used innocently by millions, that promised to draw people together but has also helped pry them apart into warring camps. It also shattered a veneer of civility and security in one of the safest and most highly developed countries in the world.A man at the door to Al Noor mosque on Deans Avenue called out â€œhello, brother,â€ just before the approaching killer opened fire with a semiautomatic shotgun. Seconds later, a wounded man, trying to crawl away, was shot again at point-blank range.Within moments, terror and chaos gripped the people gathered at the mosque for Friday Prayer, as they ran, screamed and tried to climb the walls around the building. Parents tried to shield their children, others ducked behind or under parked cars, and at least one nearby resident opened her home to shelter people fleeing the mayhem.The Facebook video, shot from the killer's helmet-mounted camera, and a 74-page statement that the authorities said was written by the gunman, point to an array of possible role models, from racist mass murderers to Oswald Mosley, the 20th century British fascist.Standard white supremacist and far-right nationalist tropes, like fears of a â€œwhite genocide,â€ are sprinkled throughout the statement. There are also elements of a self-flattering reach for larger meaning: references to centuries-ago battles between Christians and Muslims are scrawled on his guns, and on the video he refers to his slaughter of unarmed people as â€œthe firefight.â€But the potential clues in the statement appeared to be as much an exercise in misdirection, provocation and â€œtrollingâ€ as a statement of any ideology, making it hard to separate belief from inside jokes among extremists, deliberate baiting and pointless hate.New safeguards developed by tech companies over the last 18 months were not enough to stop the video and statement from being widely posted, on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. While Facebook and Twitter took down pages thought to be linked to the gunman, the posted content was spread rapidly through other accounts. Some people appeared to be using techniques to evade automated systems that find and delete content.President Trump on Friday described the attack as â€œa horrible disgraceful thing, horrible act.â€ But when asked if he saw white nationalism as a rising threat around the world, he said: â€œI don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess.â€Many Western leaders denounced the attack as an act of terrorism, and made a point of stating their support for Muslims.â€œThrough terror attacks that have taken place on U.K. soil we know only too well the pain that such horrifying attacks can cause,â€ Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said. â€œAs New Zealand has stood by us so we stand shoulder to shoulder with them, and with Muslims in New Zealand, here in the U.K. and around the world.â€Some leaders of Muslim countries had a more pointed take. On Twitter, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey called the attack â€œthe latest example of rising racism and Islamophobia.â€Driving his white S.U.V. to the Deans Avenue mosque on Friday afternoon, the gunman played aloud a propaganda song that pays tribute to Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader who was convicted of genocide and war crimes.Forty-one of the people who died were killed at that mosque. Seven others were killed at the Linwood mosque, about three miles away, and one died at Christchurch Hospital, which lies between the two.New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Saturday that a total of five firearms, including two semiautomatic weapons, were used in the attacks. New Zealand has fairly lax gun laws, but little gun violence.â€œOur gun laws will change, now is the time,â€ Ms. Ardern said, though she did not say what that legislation would look like.Ms. Ardern said the gunman had been planning to kill more people when he was apprehended. â€œIt was absolutely his intention to continue his attack,â€ she said.Two homemade explosives were found in the suspect's car, the police have said. The attack put the city of almost 400,000 people on lockdown for hours, as the police searched for more suspects, accomplices or bombs.Ms. Ardern said that while children were among the dead, the victims were â€œpredominantly from the ages of 20 to 60-ish — and a large number of men.â€Syed Mazharuddin told the New Zealand Herald that he was in the mosque on Linwood Avenue, and that â€œthere were elderly people sitting there praying and he just started shooting at them.â€Speaking to reporters on Friday, a shaken Mohammad Nazir haltingly tried to describe what he had seen inside the Deans Avenue mosque, where he said there were â€œlots of peopleâ€ lying on the blood-soaked green carpet.â€œI just heard â€˜Help! Help!' â€ he said.He ran behind the building and climbed over a wall into a neighboring yard.Mulki Abdiwahab, an 18-year-old university student, was with her mother in the women's prayer room at the Deans Avenue mosque when the gunfire began.â€œI've never heard a gunshot before,â€ she told Radio New Zealand. â€œI thought at first it was somebody was banging on the window.â€â€œMy mom grabbed my hand and then we just ran outside and everyone was in chaos, just running for their lives,â€ she said.They left behind their shoes, purses and a laptop, and did not stop running until a woman who lives down the street waved them into her house, she said.Later, they learned that her father, who like many victims was in the men's prayer room, had been wounded.The gunman's video shows him reloading repeatedly, snapping new ammunition magazines into his assault shotgun. Then he returned to his vehicle, got another gun — a semiautomatic assault rifle — went back into the building and resumed shooting.When he left for good, he fired down the sidewalk in both directions, and down the alleyway where he had parked. He walked up to a wounded woman dressed in black who lay on the pavement crying â€œhelp me, help me,â€ and shot her twice more.He left about six minutes after he had arrived. As he began to drive away, he fired into parked cars with a pump-action shotgun before speeding off.Officials did not make clear whether the Linwood Avenue attack took place before or after the Deans Avenue massacre, or if the same person committed both. The first calls to the police came at about 1:40 p.m.Yama al Nabi was running late to meet his father at the Deans Avenue mosque, when he came on the nightmarish scene of wailing and bleeding people, illuminated by the flashing lights of police cars.He asked survivors about his father, Dawoud Nabi, 65, a native of Afghanistan who had lived in New Zealand since 1977.â€œSomeone said he jumped the fence and said he's safe,â€ he told The New York Times. â€œThen I waited and waited and my daughter called and said he's dead.â€On Saturday morning, his hands shaking, he showed reporters a photo on his phone of his father and his daughter.â€œDad was the leader of the Afghan community and welcomed everyone,â€ he said.He had gone to the courthouse where the accused gunman would appear. â€œJust want to see his face,â€ he said.Members of Bangladesh's national cricket team, who were in Christchurch for a match, were also saved by tardiness, after a news conference delayed their walk to the Deans Avenue mosque.Mohammad Isam, an ESPN reporter covering the team, reported on an ESPN website that at 1:52 he got a terrified call from Tamim Iqbal Khan, one of the Bangladesh cricketers.â€œThere's shooting here, please save us,â€ Mr. Khan said, according to Mr. Isam.â€œI first think that he is playing a prank but he hangs up and calls again — this time, his voice starts to crack,â€ Mr. Isam wrote. â€œHe says that I should call the police as there's a shooting going on inside the mosque where they are about to enter.â€Mr. Khan wrote on Twitter: â€œEntire team got saved from active shooters.â€Another player, Mushfiqur Rahim, tweeted â€œwe r extremely lucky â€¦ never want to see this things happen again â€¦ pray for us.â€"
"Frank Litsky was, to borrow a line from a former colleague at The New York Times, â€œone of a kind.â€Not because he never learned to ride a bike, even though his son became a world-class cyclist. Or that, in busy retirement years, he still had dreams that he was late on a story and might miss a deadline.In an award-winning career that spanned 61 years, including 50 at The Times, Frank Litsky did it all, his way, with discipline and dedication, which he brought to the 44 sports he covered professionally.Yes, 44 sports — from archery to wrestling and, year after year, the New York City Marathon, which this year is on Sunday. He even managed to write about luge, lacrosse, cricket and softball. Few other journalists, past or present, can match that breadth.Litsky's death on Tuesday at his home in Washington, at age 92, followed a short illness. It also capped a sad sequence: Dave Anderson, another celebrated Times sportswriter and a friend of Litsky's, died early last month, at age 89.Besides their proximity as longtime residents in Bergen County, N.J., Anderson and Litsky shared many common values as â€œgood guysâ€ — hard-working journalists, husbands, fathers and mentors. And, above all, they were true to themselves.But where Anderson focused on writing as his form of self-expression, Litsky's layers of talent stretched across reporting, editing, organizing and supervising. He covered eight Olympic Games and 15 Super Bowls, but you could also find him rejoicing over close finishes at the Penn Relays or world records at a national swimming championship.And then there was Litsky the editor — not quite obsessive compulsive, but so detailed and driven by his commitment to history, organizational accuracy and fairness that any writer would gladly attest to the notion that â€œIn God We Trustâ€ might have applied to him. After all, how many people amass a college football file, spread over multiple folders, of 15,000 outstanding players that dated to 1934 or an immaculate reference card file with more than 50,000 entries?Even George Steinbrenner could hardly contest that point after Litsky once casually introduced one of his youthful assistants, Vincent Mallozzi, to Steinbrenner as a â€œyoung Yankees fan.â€ When Mallozzi innocently corrected, â€œI'm actually a Mets fan,â€ Steinbrenner smiled and said, â€œFrank is not used to making mistakes, and he probably won't make another one as long as he lives.â€I had a unique view of Litsky. First, as a sportswriter for 15 years at The Times, I filed articles under his diligent editing watch. Then, in a role reversal, I was the Times sports editor for 12 years during the 1990s and early 2000s when Litsky was reporting on the Giants during their successful Super Bowl runs under Coach Bill Parcells.â€œBack then, the relationship with members of the media was far different than it is today,â€ Parcells said by phone on Thursday. â€œIt was a group of guys you got to know, and the electronic media wasn't really around, so it was more like a group meeting.â€Parcells recalled of Litsky, â€œI found him a genuine, warm person.â€The depth of Litsky's knowledge was staggering, from precise statistical notes culled from years with sports such as track and field and swimming to more than 300 obituaries he wrote for The Times, many brought to life by his infinite knowledge and fraternity of friends, local and international. Litsky's legacy will live on for readers in the coming years through the 65 advance obituaries he has left for future publication.If you were sitting next to Litsky at a sports event, â€œyou were always in the right place,â€ a former Times colleague, Malcolm Moran, recalled. He could offer hilarious off-the-cuff, inside-the-game stories, helpful style hints or even a quality post-event dining spot he had uncovered. Small wonder that over 36 years, Litsky wrote yearbooks for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, World Book and Collier's, among others, along with a 1975 coffee-table book, â€œSuperstars,â€ that became a main selection of the Sports Illustrated Book Club.Litsky's appreciation and respect for minor sports — at a time when most news media outlets focused their coverage on football, basketball, baseball and hockey — extended to his early embrace of women's sports and gender equity. In 1967, he covered the Boston Marathon when a woman, Kathrine Switzer, was pulled off the course by race officials because only men were allowed to run it then. Decades later, his courtside account of the first national college basketball title by an undefeated UConn women's team made the front page of The Times.In 1997, Litsky became the first newspaper journalist named to the media wing of the International Swimming Hall of Fame, one of many such national honors.Born in Waterbury, Conn., Litsky graduated from the University of Connecticut in three years at age 19. After an early career with United Press, he was initially hired by The Times as a sports copy editor, specifically in Olympic sports. But over the next 11 years, his role expanded to an assistant to the sports editor supervising the weekday sports and then as a deputy sports editor supervising the Sunday section.No matter the position, there was that sense of humor. Covering the 1991 Super Bowl during his 11 years as a Giants beat writer, Litsky observed the hordes of Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms fans descending on the stadium and told a colleague, Bill Brink, â€œHere they come, the 56-11s.â€That humor attracted Zina Greene, his companion of the last 10 years after the death of his wife of 48 years, Arlene, in 2003. Litsky's son, Charlie, who often accompanied him to sports events, died in 1993 at age 33 from a heart attack during a cycling event he was competing in.Litsky's extensive sports files will be donated to a library at the University of Texas in Austin dedicated to sports and culture."
"Final or funeral? Opinions diverge as France and Croatia meet this week for the Davis Cup title in Lille, in northern France.It will be the end of another too-lengthy tennis season, but more poignantly, it also will be the end of an era for the men's team event that began in Boston in 1900.That first final, played in trousers and whites at the original site of the Longwood Cricket Club, matched the United States against Britain over three days, with a best-of-five-sets format. The Americans, whose team included the competition's founder, Dwight Davis, swept the visitors, who had crossed the Atlantic by ship without their two best players: the Doherty brothers, Reginald and Laurie.The Dohertys were eventually persuaded to make the same journey, winning the Cup for Britain at Longwood in 1903. But 115 years later, it is the flickering interest of tennis's present-day superstars that has led to radical change.If Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had all made the Davis Cup a priority at the same time, they might have lifted the event into a new golden era, just as they have elevated their sport as a whole.But it was not to be. Individual ambition, injuries and the demands of an overstuffed tennis calendar conspired against it. Federer and Nadal have played 38 times, but never in Davis Cup competition. Djokovic has played Nadal and Federer only once each in the Cup, both matches coming before he entered his prime.Beginning next year, the Davis Cup will abandon its traditional two-team final for an 18-team final phase in November in Madrid; in the new format, the stakes will be reduced from four singles matches to two, along with one doubles match, all contested over best-of-three-sets matches.Critics have taken to calling it the Kosmos Cup or the PiquÃ© Cup, references to the investment group headed by Gerard PiquÃ©, Spain's polymathic soccer star, that is largely bankrolling the revamped competition and intending to make a profit.Officially, however, the competition will remain the Davis Cup, at least in the short term, with the champions still getting their mitts on one of the oldest and grandest trophies in global sports.â€œI honestly don't see it as the end of an era as much as I see it as the end of a chapter of a long book,â€ said David Haggerty, the president of the International Tennis Federation, which controls the Cup.Haggerty, an American and the primary architect of the Cup changes, most likely will find that the public disagrees when he takes his seat on Friday in Lille. The French captain, Yannick Noah, and his players were among the most vocal opponents of the new format, even though their federation voted in favor.â€œThe Davis Cup is dead, and part of the history of our sport is gone for a handful of dollars,â€ Nicolas Mahut, the French doubles stalwart, wrote on Twitter after the I.T.F. surprisingly voted for the proposed changes in August.But even if one embraces Haggerty's metaphor, the concern has to be that the Davis Cup book could eventually go out of print. The men's tour has pushed ahead with its decision to relaunch its own team event, the ATP Cup, in January 2020 in Australia with a 10-day format that is far too similar — with 24 teams and best-of-three-sets matches.The prize money is set to be similar, too: $15 million for the ATP Cup and $18 million for the new Davis Cup. The big difference: The ATP players and their council fully back their new event, which, unlike the revised Davis Cup, will provide the extra incentive of ranking points.The fact that the events are going to be staged less than two months apart is tennis at its most dysfunctional. Redesigning the Davis Cup and doing away with a home-and-away final phase and tradition make sense only if there is a guarantee that most of the best players are going to play. The ATP Cup makes such assurances impossible, even if ATP officials have repeatedly told me that their event was â€œnever meant to replace or rival Davis Cup.â€But there has been some buyers' — or is it sellers'? — remorse, and there have been two recent rounds of meetings among the ATP, the I.T.F. and representatives of the four Grand Slam tournaments.The idea — obvious but still overdue — is to work more closely together for the good of the sport, and toward a more harmonious calendar. Djokovic, back at No. 1 and a very proactive head of the ATP player council, was part of the most recent meeting, held last week during the ATP Finals in London.Davis Cup tennis helped make Djokovic: His performance in 2010 as Serbia won the Cup for the first time cemented his status as a national hero and helped propel him to dominance on the regular tour in 2011.Now, with his influence spiking again, he can help make or break it. Djokovic has said it would be better to have a single men's team event, which is undoubtedly true. But with Kosmos and its millions in the mix, tennis's alphabet soup of power players now has another letter.Compromise will be even trickier, but the hope is for a rethink and a more sustainable model by 2021 — after the Davis Cup final spends two years in Madrid and the ATP Cup launches in Australia. Some Grand Slam leaders have suggested that a combined event involving the men and women and backed by all governing bodies could be the way forward. Others think shifting the Davis Cup to earlier in the season — with the ATP's support — could be enough of a remedy, even if that could create a logjam in September with the Laver Cup team event, which Federer helped start in 2017 and now prioritizes.The good news: Plans for a new, winner-take-all singles event backed by Kosmos and tentatively called the Majesty Cup have been put on the back burner for now as negotiations proceed.Muddy waters? Absolutely. But what is clear is that the Davis Cup as generations have long known it will soon be gone: three days of best-of-five-set tennis with the spotlight on two nations and a large unabashedly home crowd, like the one expected this weekend in Lille. It has been quite a tale: full of plot twists, upsets and indelible characters like Bill Tilden, Ken Rosewall, John McEnroe and Noah, to name just a very few.That might be worth definitively turning the page for if you know your odds of getting something more lucrative and, most importantly, more relevant are good. But as tennis's cups runneth over and into each other, that is hardly how the odds look at the moment."
"A girl in a yellow dress waves goodbye to her sailor boy with her pink handkerchief. He's out of sight, but we see the marvels she imagines he'll encounter on his voyage: a raft with a dog and a flag; a tropical island with a hut and a palm tree; an octopus; a spouting whale; a guy — is it our sailor? — in a vintage deep-sea-diving suit and a funky little submarine. The Sailor's Farewell, Kit Kemp's whimsical new pattern is called. Painted on Wedgwood china and hand embroidered on lush linen, it will be released in April, when Kemp's pop-up shop opens at Bergdorf Goodman. Kemp, who is the designer and co-owner (with her husband) of the Firmdale Hotels in London and New York, seems to live with a fantastical zoo in her head; previous collections for Wedgwood and Chelsea Textiles include Wee Beasties and Mythical Creatures (hairy green bugs, deep purple critters), as well as Moondog, which features a tiny, deliciously whimsical pooch looking through a dog-scale telescope at the night sky.This is my kind of whimsy: the English kind. Kemp, with her pell-mell charm and seductive scribbles, reminds me most of all of Edward Lear. The 19th-century English artist and writer was a serious painter, but he is most loved for his nonsense verse â€œThe Owl and the Pussycat.â€ My own favorite of its characters is the â€œPiggy-wigâ€ with a â€œring at the ends of his nose.â€Mercurial, brilliant, witty, Lear was profoundly English, as was his contemporary, Lewis Carroll, who created his own strange and wonderful world and a very whimsical language to go with it. (â€œFrabjous,â€ â€œmimsy,â€ â€œgalumphâ€ and â€œchortleâ€ are just a few of his invented words.) But then, whimsy has been baked into the English, like toad in the hole or bubble and squeak, for a long time, perhaps as far back as the 16th century. As the Oxford Dictionary has it: â€œWhimsey: whimsical device, trifle. 1520s from Scandinavian hvima to let the eye wander.â€The English eye did a lot of wandering — if you lived on a damp little island, you'd be dreaming of distant places — and this penchant has always influenced English taste. The result: wildly assorted visual and poetic permutations, real, imaginary, literary. The Metaphysical poets, who were cracking the mold as far back as the 17th century, were anointed by Samuel Johnson in the 18th when he said, â€œThey used the most heterogeneous ideas yoked by violence together.â€ Who but John Donne could see a pair of lovers and a whole world through a poem about a bloodsucking flea?There might have been whimsy in the English blood for a long, long time, but the 19th century, with its imperial ambitions, was ripe for it. Whimsy was, in a sense, a reaction to the brutal times when England bulldozed its way across the world, tossing countries into its empire like butterflies into a net. It was at the beginning of the 19th century that the most whimsical of all buildings, the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, was finished. It was a pleasure palace by the sea, taking from China and India the domes and turrets and cupolas, the rich silks, the chandeliers that resemble upside-down umbrellas. Commissioned by George IV when he was still the extravagant and often drunk Prince Regent (and son of the most whimsical of kings, George III — or â€œMad King Georgeâ€), the Pavilion turned a dull little seaside town into a thrilling, cosmopolitan destination. Only Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow's Red Square gives it a run for its fantastical aspect.Kit Kemp's hotels (two in New York, six in London) all show off her wandering eye and her mercurial taste. And it's not just the china and the fabrics but also the rooms and bars and lobbies; each is a playful, whimsical riot of patterns and colors, fabrics and pictures and stuff. But behind this whimsy is a singular imagination. Kemp's designs are not the product of chance but a kind of planned chaos. The drawing room at Ham Yard has a gorgeous French fireplace and a fine period wood secretary; the walls are covered in a seemingly wild assortment of Kemp's fabrics — orange, green, yellow, turquoise; the walls are lined with bookcases (and books) and hung with old plates and prints. And somehow, when I settle into the carroty (or is it cantaloupe?) Moondog-covered chair, it feels toasty and snug against the English rain battering the window. Nothing here feels cute, quaint or kitsch, though whimsy can fall that way, into a slough of soggy sentimentality sometimes laced with an emetic of twee.Of course, kitsch depends on the perspective: An English garden gnome taken seriously is depressing; viewed with irony, it's droll. For some, Winnie-the-Pooh is a delicious reminder of childhood, though I'm with Dorothy Parker who, in reviewing A. A. Milne's second Pooh book for The New Yorker, famously wrote that the book's fifth page was â€œthe first place in â€˜The House at Pooh Corner' at which Tonstant Weader Fwowed up.â€I'll take my whimsy from Clarice Cliff, the great English potter. Working in the 1920s and '30s, she made Art Deco plates and pots in angular shapes and bright hot colors. Her teapot in the shape of a Native American tepee shows a love for what she saw as the exotic, the whimsical, the foreign. But the English relationship with whimsy is sometimes naÃ¯ve, sometimes weird, queer, freakish. Think punk, Vivienne Westwood and Grayson Perry, the cross-dressing sculptor and artist.But what other country could have produced a detective like Lord Peter Wimsey? Dorothy L. Sayers's detective is nothing if not mischievous, a witty, waggish, brilliant fellow who plays Bach, excels at cricket and the identification of dead bodies, and whose family (the Dukes of Denver) motto is â€œAs my whimsy takes me.â€ A cross between Fred Astaire and Bertie Wooster, according to Sayers, Lord Peter, is a top-of-the-line dilettante, the exact opposite of the plodding corporate cop.England, or at least its whimsy, has changed me — or at least my apartment in downtown Manhattan. There was a time when my loft wore only white with bare wood floors and a glass table. (I once told my goddaughter, with a kind of Stalinist certainty, that clothes were black, dÃ©cor white.) Now, my sofas wear pale green linen, my floor an overdyed hot pink rug. (A designer friend said, â€œBuy it, it will make you smile every morning,â€ and it does.) I'm planning to cover a chair in Kit Kemp's Moondog linen. I'll sit in that chair, drinking my cup of tea in a blue Sailor's Farewell mug, reading John Donne or â€œJabberwockyâ€ and listening to â€œSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.â€"
"LUTON, England — It was 5:50 on a Friday morning, and most of the people at a Starbucks in the middle of a shopping concourse at Luton Airport, north of London, looked slightly miserable, as if they preferred to be somewhere else.A man in a green hoodie sat with his chin propped on his hand, staring at a departure board. A young couple next to him looked at their phones, ignoring each other. There was little conversation, and no laughter.A few feet away, though, at the Smithfield Pub (â€œEst. 2017â€), which was designed to look like a wood cabin, the mood was more festive.A couple were drinking strawberry-flavored cider to celebrate the start of a romantic trip to Paris. A woman was ordering gin and tonics and pints of Guinness for her friends, while swaying to music at the bar. Two men heading to Alicante, Spain, for a cricket tour were laughing while drinking lager.â€œWe're wearing yellow chinos; we need this to feel better,â€ said Jolyon Bryce, one of the men.For many, early drinking is a tradition at Britain's airports, but it could soon become a thing of the past. On Thursday, the British government announced that it would review airport licensing rules in England and Wales after complaints from budget airlines like Ryanair, easyJet and Jet2.com about drunk and disorderly passengers.At London Stansted Airport this summer, for example, a groom dressed as the Disney character Tinker Bell was accused of threatening other passengers on a Ryanair flight to Krakow, Poland, delaying the plane. He had to be escorted off.Such antics are a menace, causing stress, spurring physical altercations and, the airlines said, causing flights to be delayed or diverted. Ryanair said in a statement last year, â€œIt's completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences.â€Outside of airports, most local authorities limit the number of places that can sell alcohol around the clock, and the usual closing time for bars and pubs is between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. But bars at international airports are exempt from Britain's licensing rules; one can generally get a drink at any hour.The Home Office is seeking public comments on whether the stricter licensing rules should apply to airports, too. The government has suggested banning alcohol sales at airport pubs from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.British newspapers expressed shock at the news. â€œDeparty's over: Brit holidaymakers could be BANNED from 24-hour boozing at U.K. airports,â€ said The Sun.Twitter quickly filled with jokes, with one person lamenting, â€œIt's over, lads.â€The government's examination follows a 2017 recommendation from a committee in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the British Parliament, to lift the licensing exemption because of a growth in booze-fueled disorder.Jet2.com told the committee that it had handled 536 incidents in summer 2016 alone, more than half of which involved alcohol. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority received more than 400 reports of disruptive passengers last year, up from fewer than 100 in 2013. A majority of those involved drunken passengers, the authority said in an email on Friday.Those opposed to any change — the alcohol industry and bars at airports, for example — note that the number of reported disorderly passengers was tiny compared with the more than 280 million passengers who used British airports last year.The debate is reminiscent of the one that occurred when Britain exempted airports from licensing laws in the 1950s. Harold Watkinson, the transport secretary at the time, argued that the change was essential to attract tourists.â€œOne may forgive them if they do not always understand why it is that they cannot always obtain a drink,â€ he said in 1956. â€œAlmost every other international airport gives a 24-hour service.â€Britain, proponents said, had to match the availability of alcohol to compete.But even back then, others saw a huge downside. A traveler who has a meal and an alcoholic beverage at the airport â€œgoes onto a plane perfectly sober and is so for perhaps an hour afterwards,â€ Somerville Hastings, a Labour Party lawmaker, said in a debate in 1956. â€œBut later, he develops the symptoms of intoxication and becomes a nuisance.â€Being drunk on a flight is illegal in Britain, and endangering the safety of an aircraft is punishable by up to five years in jail.At the Smithfield Pub at Luton, meanwhile, there was little appetite for changing the law to ban morning drinking. â€œSurely it's a bigger problem at night?â€ said Inese Grinberga, 27, who was heading home to Latvia after traveling the world. â€œWhy stop it in the morning?â€Ms. Grinberga was sharing a beer with a friend. They had decided to drink, she said, after walking past the pub and joking about â€œall the crazy people with pints at 7 a.m.â€Timmi Clark, 27, echoed the opposition. She was drinking a rose-petal covered gin and tonic while wearing a tiara to kick-start her bridal shower party in Bratislava, Slovakia.â€œIt's my hen party, so I'm celebrating,â€ she said. â€œBut it's like tradition: You're on holiday; you have a drink. Why stop that?â€Another person consuming alcohol, Sam Pugh, who was on his way to Athens for a 30th birthday bash, was halfway through a pint of lager. He said that preventing morning drinking would not stop travelers from getting drunk on planes, since passengers can buy booze on the flights.The government should be tackling another problem, Mr. Pugh said. â€œI know you can be banned from getting on a plane for being drunk,â€ he said, â€œbut you can't for being an idiot. It might be better if they banned idiots.â€Brian Malloy, 27, who was headed to Bulgaria for his bachelor party, was sitting on the pub's floor, throwing up into a plastic bag. He had too much to drink the night before, said Sean Hammon, Mr. Malloy's future brother-in-law. He did not appear to spoil anyone else's mood, however, even the families eating breakfast nearby.The bachelor party also did not see the merits of changing the law to curb early drinking.â€œIt makes no sense,â€ Mr. Hammon said. â€œYou can only fit in one drink before you get on a plane and you can buy drinks on there.â€He added, â€œThey don't let you on drunk, anyway.â€Mr. Malloy himself had no comment. But he did manage a thumbs up when asked if he was O.K."
"Yonkers wasn't their first choice. It wasn't even on their radar. But when Jonathan Rios, 28, and Saul Caguao, 31, both interior designers, decided to move in together, they knew finding an apartment that made financial and logistical sense wouldn't be easy.At the time, Mr. Rios was living on the Upper West Side and working in Chelsea, while Mr. Caguao lived and worked in Stamford, Conn.Mr. Rios wanted to stay on the Upper West Side, where he had been paying less than $1,000 a month for a small, dark, courtyard-facing room in a three-bedroom apartment. â€œIt had just enough space to center my bed and have two small side tables,â€ he said. Surely, he reasoned, someone looking for a one-bedroom in the same neighborhood with a budget of $2,300 would be able to find something at least slightly more gracious?â€œWhat I found in that price range was the smallest and the darkest: mostly older buildings with really weird layouts; not ideal, very cramped, with stuff like diagonal walls, which is not easy to decorate,â€ Mr. Rios said. â€œIt was more than I wanted to spend for nothing remarkable.â€Mr. Caguao had never been particularly on board with the Upper West Side plan, given that it would increase his commute from essentially no time at all to a trek of more than hour involving the subway, a bus and a Metro-North train.It was around that time that Mr. Rios went to visit a friend in Yonkers, which is immediately north of the Bronx, in Westchester County. A few years earlier, his friend had bought a condo off the Greystone stop of the Metro-North line, and before Mr. Rios returned to Manhattan, they swung by the friend's brother's place at Modera Hudson Riverfront, a new development on the banks of the Hudson River two train stops closer to Manhattan.â€œI'd never considered Yonkers before,â€ Mr. Rios said. â€œBut I loved his apartment. And I found the idea of living on the river charming.â€Before going home Mr. Rios stopped by the leasing office, where he learned that a spacious one-bedroom with an unobstructed view of the river would cost $2,350 a month. To move in, they would only need to put down a $500 security deposit, and they would get the first two months free. Although Mr. Caguao had not accompanied him on the social call, he was amenable to the idea, which would mean a commute of about 40 minutes for both of them. â€œHe sent me pictures and I was like, â€˜O.K.,'â€ Mr. Caguao said.They signed the lease on July 3, and the next day, a barge in the river set off a huge fireworks display, which seemed an auspicious start to their tenancy.Occupations: Mr. Rios works for Denton House, a design studio in Chelsea, and runs his own design practice, Jonathan Vincent Design. Mr. Caguao is a claims manager for Wakefield Design Center, in Stamford, Conn., a company that sells custom and handmade furniture to interior designers. On living outside New York City: When he finally moved to Manhattan after living in Brooklyn and Queens, Mr. Rios, a Connecticut native, said he would never leave again, â€œnot even to visit friends in Brooklyn.â€ But then he saw what they could afford on their budget in Yonkers. The unobstructed river view: Sold them on the apartment. But they wish that the waterfront sculpture garden outside their window did not include an enormous stone table flanked by very large, regal-looking heads that seem to be peering into their apartment.Life in Yonkers, however, was not quite as idyllic as Mr. Rios had imagined.â€œWhen you get off the train, you only see that cute waterfront area. The rest of the city is not so cute,â€ he said. â€œThe first time I drove with Saul from Stamford to Yonkers, we got lost in the city and I was like, â€˜What did I just do?'â€They also soon realized that there was not much in the way of dining options, let alone night life, within walking distance of their building. One of the few places nearby is a French-Asian fusion restaurant with entrees starting at around $30 — a nice spot for special occasions, but hardly what they considered to be a neighborhood standby.â€œIn Stamford, you can go out at night; Yonkers, not so much,â€ said Mr. Caguao, who moved to the United States from Venezuela two years ago. â€œThat's what I love about Stamford: lots of restaurants and going-out places.â€The obvious alternative was socializing mostly in Manhattan, which they had already planned to do a lot of anyway. The commute to the city is faster than it would be from many neighborhoods in the boroughs. But the last train home is at 1:50 a.m., so on late nights out with friends, they either have to rush back to Grand Central or cough up $80 to $120 for a car home.Still, they quickly came to appreciate many features of their new building: central air-conditioning, an in-unit washer and dryer, a â€œsurprisingly greatâ€ gym, a pool and a rooftop terrace. There is also ample closet space in their apartment. â€œI keep saying, â€˜I finally have space like a normal person,'â€ Mr. Rios said.â€œAnd here, at night, there are no horns, no people yelling,â€ he added. â€œJust the sounds of crickets and waves.â€Decorating an apartment with lovely western light and no weird walls has also been a delight. Fortunately, they share a similar aesthetic.â€œWhen we were picking the couch, he sent me five and we both liked the same two,â€ Mr. Caguao said. They have mixed less expensive acquisitions, like their $700 sofa, with pricier pieces they were able to buy at a discount from the design center where Mr. Caguao works.The transition to Yonkers may not have been completely seamless, but Mr. Rios said he felt good about the city and their decision to move there.Mr. Caguao laughed.â€œWell, I don't love the city itself yet, but I'm looking forward to changes,â€ Mr. Rios said. â€œI think Yonkers is going to become a lot more like Stamford in a few years.â€â€œHopefully,â€ Mr. Caguao replied.And in some ways, Mr. Rios said, it is as if he never left New York City. â€œI'm still integrated into Manhattan life,â€ he said. â€œGoing to the grocery store, for example: I just go to the Whole Foods in Chelsea, which is not really that much different than going to the one in Columbus Circle and taking the subway to the Upper West Side.â€"
"Jane R. Madell, a pediatric audiology consultant and speech-language pathologist in Brooklyn, N.Y., wants every parent with a child who is born hearing-impaired to know that it is now possible for nearly all children with severe hearing loss to learn to listen and speak as if their hearing were completely normal.â€œChildren identified with hearing loss at birth and fitted with technology in the first weeks of life blend in so well with everyone else that people don't realize there are so many deaf children,â€ she told me.With the appropriate hearing device and auditory training for children and their caregivers during the preschool years, even those born deaf â€œwill have the ability to learn with their peers when they start school,â€ Dr. Madell said. â€œEighty-five percent of such children are successfully mainstreamed. Parents need to know that listening and spoken language is a possibility for their children.â€Determined to get this message out to all who learn their children lack normal hearing, Dr. Madell and Irene Taylor Brodsky produced a documentary, â€œThe Listening Project,â€ to demonstrate the enormous help available through modern hearing assists and auditory training.Among the â€œstarsâ€ in the film, all of whom grew up deaf or severely hearing-impaired, are Dr. Elizabeth Bonagura, an obstetrician-gynecologist and surgeon; Jake Spinowitz, a musician; Joanna Lippert, a medical social worker, and Amy Pollick, a psychologist. All started out with hearing aids that helped them learn to speak and understand spoken language.But now all have cochlear implants that, as Ms. Lippert put it, â€œreally revolutionized my worldâ€ when, at age 11, she became the first preteen to get a cochlear implant at New York University Medical Center.â€œSuddenly when I was playing soccer, I could hear what my teammates were saying,â€ Ms. Lippert, now 33, recalled. â€œMy mother practically cried when I heard a cricket chirping in the house. I couldn't talk on the phone before. Now in my job at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital in Manhattan, I'm on the phone all day long. The implant has been a wonderful gift.â€Ms. Pollick, 43 and deaf since birth, lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and two young children, all with normal hearing. Her deaf parents, determined that she learn to speak, got her a hearing aid at 6 months along with years of auditory therapy. A graduate of New York's prestigious Stuyvesant High School and Wesleyan University, Ms. Pollick was in graduate school researching primate vocalizations when she got a cochlear implant.She told me, â€œThe earlier you get the implant, the more successful it is because the more auditory input the brain gets at an early age, the better the auditory skills you will develop.â€Dr. Bonagura, 34, who lives in Alameda, Calif., didn't get a cochlear implant until she was 22. She said it made medical school a lot easier and enabled her to work in obstetrics, a field that involves emergencies, loud operating rooms and the use of face masks that make lip reading impossible.â€œNo other field of medicine compares to the joy of delivering babies,â€ she said.Mr. Spinowitz, a 27-year-old guitarist living in San Francisco, was born with profound hearing loss and used hearing aids until age 15 when suddenly they no longer worked because there was nothing to amplify — he had lost all residual hearing.Once he got his implant, he said, â€œI began listening to music — all kinds of music — trying to make up for lost time.â€ He played in bands throughout high school and college and now works at YouTube helping music labels get their work represented.â€œThe implant made it easier to communicate in all kinds of situations. It made college and my job possible,â€ Mr. Spinowitz said. His message to the parents of children with profound hearing loss: â€œSound makes the world a better place, so if you can have it, go for it.â€A cochlear implant bypasses the nonfunctioning hair cells of the auditory system and transmits sound directly to the auditory nerve so that the brain can process it. Implants can be inserted in babies before they can walk. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, children with profound hearing loss who receive implants before 18 months of age â€œdevelop language skills at a rate comparable to children with normal hearing.â€ As Dr. Bonagura says in the documentary, â€œThe ability now to put implants in babies is incredible. They grow up with sound; they grow up hearing everything. Sound is a gift — laughter, voices, nature. How can you take that away from anyone?â€Still, many deaf people resist the current technology and insist that children with profound hearing loss should learn only sign language. They reject the idea that deafness needs to be corrected. But, as Dr. Madell points out, only 0.1 percent of the population knows sign language, and 95 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, who then have to spend a long time learning to sign, during a period when children are normally learning to speak.â€œDeafness today is not what it was 20 years ago,â€ she said. â€œTechnology is so much better that virtually every child with hearing loss will be able to hear with the right devices — hearing aids and cochlear implants.â€Every baby born in the United States is supposed to be screened at birth for hearing loss. One baby in 1,000 of those screened will turn out to have moderate, severe or profound hearing loss that, if not promptly and properly treated, can delay their ability to learn to speak and understand speech.Today's auditory technology makes it possible for these babies to be fitted with a device that enables them to hear and, with auditory training, develop language skills as good as those of their normal-hearing peers.Without newborn screening, critical months for learning spoken language can be lost. Children with serious hearing loss who are not screened at birth or soon thereafter often do not get their hearing checked until many months later when parents realize that they don't respond appropriately to sounds and speech, or even later when they don't start to speak at the usual milestones.The American Academy of Pediatrics has established what are known as 1-3-6 guidelines that state that every baby should be screened for hearing by 1 month of age, a diagnosis of hearing loss made by 3 months and entry into early intervention services by 6 months. Yet currently only 67 percent of babies with profound hearing loss receive appropriate intervention by 6 months of age."
"LONDON — Theresa May rose to her feet before the British House of Commons on Thursday to make the sales pitch of her life, promising that the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union would be â€œsmooth and orderly.â€It was not supposed to be a laugh line.But the members of Parliament laughed out loud at Mrs. May. They laughed uproariously, and for long enough that she had to pause, eyes flickering over her papers, and wait for them to stop, so she could continue.Over the past two and a half years as prime minister, Mrs. May, 62, has plenty of experience being derided and conspired against. On Thursday, the day she publicly presented her long-awaited, 585-page deal to withdraw from the bloc, or Brexit, she took such a pummeling that her survival as prime minister was in question.The morning papers announced â€œhorrific, humiliating surrender,â€ â€œBrexsh*t,â€ and a â€œstitch-up that doesn't have a hope in hell.â€ By breakfast time her chief negotiator for withdrawal from the European Union had resigned in protest, followed by her work and pensions secretary.When members of Parliament were given the chance to comment on the agreement, it was one withering blast after another. Fully 57 minutes of denunciation passed before a member, Peter Bottomley, offered Mrs. May a few lukewarm words of support, saying she was â€œgood-naturedâ€ and â€œanswers questions, however insulting, with calmness, which I find is admirable.â€Shortly thereafter, a high-profile Conservative announced he had submitted a letter of no-confidence in Mrs. May, the first step in an obscure party process that could trigger her ouster. She was left to contemplate the obvious: Having taken office with the single goal of negotiating the withdrawal, she may not remain in power long enough to finish the job.â€œAm I going to see this through? Yes,â€ she told an evening news conference, repeating it later, for good measure. Then she compared herself to the dogged, unglamorous cricket player Geoffrey Boycott, known for reliably and heavily scoring runs. â€œAnd what did you know about Geoffrey Boycott? Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it, and he got the runs in the end,â€ she said.The draft plan was bound to disappoint many Britons who voted for Brexit hoping for a clean break. To avoid border checks between Ireland, which is part of the bloc, and Northern Ireland, which will not be, the deal calls for the United Kingdom to abide by European Union customs rules until future trade deals are worked out.This compromise went over badly with hard-line Brexiteers. One Conservative lawmaker described the draft as â€œa â€˜Hotel California' Brexit deal, which ensures we can never truly leave the E.U.â€Even if Mrs. May survives an attempt by rebels within her own party to oust her, she now seems unlikely to win parliamentary approval for her agreement.â€œIf she doesn't see this through, she will go down in history as a poor leader,â€ said Rosa Prince, the author of a May biography. When Mrs. May's predecessor, David Cameron, stepped down, Ms. Prince said, â€œeveryone thought, â€˜Who's a safe pair of hands?' If she can't survive the chaos, the whole reason she was there falls down. She fails on her own terms, and on everyone else's as well.â€If Mrs. May is removed from office in the coming months, Ms. Prince added, she will be one of the shortest-serving prime ministers in British history.â€œShe wants to be remembered for something,â€ Ms. Prince said.Mrs. May's gravest challenge on Thursday came from Jacob Rees-Mogg, a bespectacled Tory who styles himself after aristocratic gentlemen in the novels of P.G. Wodehouse. Mr. Rees-Mogg, a backbencher who opposes abortion and gay rights, and supports welfare cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy, was for years one of British politics' favorite eccentrics, described by some as the â€œhonorable member for the 18th century.â€But in the more fiercely ideological age ushered in by Brexit, Mr. Rees-Mogg has emerged as a charismatic leader, vigorously advocating for a full break from the European Union. And it was he, on Thursday, who most theatrically vowed to block the plan his â€œright honorable friendâ€ — Mrs. May — had put forward.â€œMy right honorable friend — and she is unquestionably honorable — said we would leave the customs union. Annex 2 says otherwise,â€ Mr. Rees-Mogg said in a sonorous voice, referring to a provision of the deal regulating trade with Northern Ireland. â€œMy right honorable friend said that she would maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom. A whole protocol says otherwise.â€He went on, with dramatic effect, to directly threaten Mrs. May: â€œAs what my right honorable friend says, and what my right honorable friend does, no longer match, should I not write to my right honorable friend, the member for Altrincham and Sale West?â€He meant a letter to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, a secretive body with the power to trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader at the request of 15 percent of its membership. If a majority of Conservative lawmakers then were to vote against her, Mrs. May could be compelled to resign, a procedure that has been used only once.Mr. Rees-Mogg, who addressed reporters at Westminster on Thursday, took umbrage when a journalist described his parliamentary speech as a â€œcoup.â€â€œThis is working through the procedures of the Conservative party, therefore it is entirely constitutional. Dare I say to Newsnight,â€ he went on, addressing a journalist. â€œCoup is the wrong word.â€Tim Bale, the author of a history of the Conservative Party, said the no-confidence process was intentionally designed to be secretive. To make a letter public, as Mr. Rees-Mogg did on Thursday, is highly unusual, he said, and a sign of a party that had become â€œa much more ideologically febrile institution than it used to be.â€â€œYou used to be able to rely on Tory MPs to be broadly loyal,â€ said Mr. Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. â€œI think now you have a bunch of people who are actually prepared to die in a ditch for an idea, or a principle, and that is a big, big change.â€In his years observing the party, Mr. Bale added, he had â€œnever seen anything like this — the absolute multiple pileup we're seeing in terms of the ideological problems, the personnel problems, the disloyalty, the willingness to make people's feelings public, it's just unprecedented.â€When Mrs. May held her news conference on Thursday evening, the strain of the last 48 hours — a tense, five-hour negotiation with cabinet ministers on Wednesday night, followed by hours of one-on-one talks and a three-hour grilling in Parliament — showed on her face, but she vowed to keep fighting.A naturally reserved person, hard-pressed to project warmth, and uncomfortable in the spotlight, she faces the monumental task, in the days and weeks ahead, of persuading lawmakers and their constituents to support a plan many find disappointing.â€œIt's the biggest act of persuasion,â€ said Alasdair Palmer, who worked briefly as a speechwriter for Mrs. May when she served as home secretary. â€œShe can't do it on the force of personality. The only thing she can do it on is a sober assessment of the alternatives.â€He added, however, he was astounded by her stamina.â€œShe's just able to grit her teeth and get on with it,â€ Mr. Palmer said. â€œShe feels the country's on the line.â€"
