# MapReduce
Collected and stored 20,000+ tweets and 1,000 articles from New York Times and Common Crawl.  Using HDFS and Hadoop, we created a Map Reduce Model that visually displays the most common used words through tableau.  These words exclude common words such as (a, we, the, them, etc).  This was achieved by web scraping data, parsing and cleaning up the data, and then using map reduce methods. Also include co-word occurence using hdfs mapper and reducer methods.).
